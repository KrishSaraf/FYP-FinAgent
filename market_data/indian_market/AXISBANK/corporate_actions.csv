The following however is the factual position in this regard:  1. The Board of Directors of the Bank at its meeting held on February 20, 2007 reappointed Mr. Nayak as Chairman & Managing Director for a further period of 2 years commencing August 01, 2007, subject to the approval of The Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and subject thereafter to the approval of shareholders.  2. While SUUTI has accorded formal approval for the reappointment of Mr. Nayak, RBI has declined to give approval and has proposed instead that the Office of Chairman and Managing Director should be bifurcated into two in accordance with the recommendations of the Dr. Ganguly Group Report on Corporate Governance and in accordance with international best practices. It has accordingly sought a revised proposal from the Bank on whether Mr. Nayak should be reappointed either as Chairman or as Managing Director.  3. Mr. Nayak has informed the RBI and the Remuneration & Nomination Committee of the Board of the Bank that after having spent over 7.5 (seven & half) years as CMD of the Bank, it would not be possible for him to function in a different and lesser capacity in the Bank and he will therefore cease to be associated with the Bank after July 31, 2007.  4.
