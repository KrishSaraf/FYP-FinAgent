        "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/dpq0dze8b1je1.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=8699538a109a1127c6749197786a0b44fb3e8d1e\n\n  \nHey,,  \nIf you are into short selling like me (and making money in last 2 months), the good news is that US has announced reciprocal tariffs and it will share details on 1st April (country wise), India is already knows as 'Tariff king' as said by Trump.\n\nAs a short seller who use AI a lot, here's my research for possible shorting oppurtunity:\n\n# Which Indian Sectors Are at Risk for Tariffs?\n\nGiven Trump's trade policies and focus on protecting American industries, these sectors are the most likely targets for tariffs:\n\n# 1. Pharmaceuticals (Exports: $7.55 billion) \u2013 High Risk\n\n* The U.S. imports a massive amount of **generic drugs** from India.\n* Trump has pushed for **onshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing** in the U.S.\n* **Likely action**: Higher tariffs on **generic medicines** from India to protect U.S. pharma firms.\n\n# 2. Precious Metals & Stones (Exports: $10.17 billion) \u2013 Moderate-High Risk\n\n* India is one of the biggest exporters of **cut and polished diamonds** to the U.S.\n* Trump previously **increased tariffs on Chinese jewelry**; he may do the same to India.\n* **Likely action**: Tariffs on **diamonds and jewelry** to promote local manufacturing.\n\n# 3. Electrical & Electronic Equipment (Exports: $9.89 billion) \u2013 Moderate-High Risk\n\n* Includes **Motherson Sumi, ABB India, and Exide Industries**.\n* India exports **electronic components and auto electronics**, competing with U.S. firms.\n* **Trump previously targeted China with tech-related tariffs.**\n* **Likely action**: Import duties on **Indian auto electronics, semiconductors, and batteries**.\n\n# 4. Automotive & Auto Parts (Exports: $2.58 billion) \u2013 Moderate Risk\n\n* **Hero MotoCorp** and **Motherson Sumi** export motorcycles and auto components.\n* Trump previously **imposed tariffs on European & Chinese auto imports**.\n* **Likely action**: Tariffs on **Indian two-wheelers and auto components** to support U.S. manufacturers.\n\n# 5. Textiles & Apparel (Exports: $2.64 billion) \u2013 Moderate Risk\n\n* India is a **top textile and apparel exporter** to the U.S.\n* Trump **previously imposed tariffs on China\u2019s textile exports**.\n* **Likely action**: Higher duties on **Indian garments** to boost U.S. production.\n\n# 6. Oil & Petrochemicals (Exports: $6.52 billion) \u2013 Low-Moderate Risk\n\n* **Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and ONGC** export refined petroleum to the U.S.\n* The U.S. wants **energy independence**, so **tariffs on Indian oil** could be possible.\n* **Likely action**: A tariff on **Indian refined oil products**, but impact may be low.\n\n# 7. IT & Software Services (Not in the export goods list, but a huge sector) \u2013 Low Risk\n\n* India dominates **IT services and outsourcing** for American companies.\n* Instead of tariffs, Trump might **tighten visa rules (H-1B restrictions)**.\n\nHowever, this is just one parameter, rest you can check in weekly which stocks are already going down and on daily check if they are over bought, this given oppurtunity to enter the market>\n\nI am not against Indian market, I am just a trader who makes money on both sides and right now for this year I am highly bearish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1fvqgtwbc1je1.jpg?width=936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffa245f2acf0d41515f2cf450893277d04806aeb\n\n(My positions today at 10.20 AM, 14th Feb, 2025)  \n",

But a substantial sum out of this has been invested in the last 3-4 months.\n\nPoint is to review the portfolio / allocation etc. as it stands today - for the future. That is why I have provided current value of holdings (though invested sum can be calculated pretty easily). Past gains (especially %ages) are indicative of pretty much nothing as I have been irregular in buying and accumulating over the said period.\n\nWould love everyone's views and opinions. \n\nPS - discerning folks on here will be able to see Saurabh Mukherjea's influence but even more discerning (and sympathethic) folks will be able to see I am reducing the said influence now \ud83d\ude04\n\nLATE (AND LONG) EDIT - As rightly said in some replies, MF portfolio has some unnecessary over-complication. I'm slowly moving my inv from Axis ELSS to PP ELSS (as and when 3 year limit ends), so count one less fund. The two PP funds again I count as basically one big Flexi fund, so that's again one less fund. Small caps I don't feel comfortable with just one fund, and the universe is large enough to accommodate two funds. \nSo basically-\n\u2022one Largecap (Niftybees) \n\u2022one Flexicap (2 PPs + whatever's left of Axis)\n\u2022one Large & Mid\n\u2022one Midcap\n\u2022two Smallcaps\n\u2022one USA (where in fact if someone can suggest which should I actually invest in, anyway PP Flexi can't invest more in the US stocks). \n\n",

        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

On the daily timeframe, the stock has formed an RSI divergence, and today it broke above the neckline of this divergence, closing 4.3% higher while reclaiming the 40-day EMA. Additionally, the breakout is supported by an RMI buy signal across all timeframes. However, the stock faced selling pressure towards the end of the session, resulting in a wick formation. The key question now is whether it can sustain this breakout.\n\n",

Instead of waiting for recovery, utilize basic short-selling strategies.\n2. **Short Selling Strategy for Futures**\n   * Identify stocks that are trending\u00a0**down**\u00a0on a weekly timeframe.\n   * On the daily timeframe, look for stocks where the\u00a0**RSI (Relative Strength Index)**\u00a0is above 70, indicating they are overbought.\n   * Enter a short position in futures, as the bias aligns with the downward trend.\n3. **Intraday Short Selling Strategy**\n   * Use the\u00a0**ADX (Average Directional Index)**\u00a0to confirm trends.\n   * Look for stocks trending\u00a0**down**\u00a0on the daily chart, but with\u00a0**RSI above 70**\u00a0(overbought) on the hourly chart.\n   * Enter short positions with even lots, set a desired stop-loss amount, and manage your position as follows:\n      * Once the trade turns profitable, sell half the quantity equivalent to your stop-loss amount.\n      * Let the remaining trade ride until the end of the day.\n4. **Why Focus on Shorting in a Bear Market?**\n   * This is an ideal bear market where\u00a0**FIIs (Foreign Institutional Investors)**\u00a0are consistently shorting.\n   * There are\u00a0**no strong reasons**\u00a0to expect a market recovery anytime soon.",

On the daily timeframe, the stock has formed an RSI divergence, and today it broke above the neckline of this divergence, closing 4.3% higher while reclaiming the 40-day EMA. Additionally, the breakout is supported by an RMI buy signal across all timeframes. However, the stock faced selling pressure towards the end of the session, resulting in a wick formation. The key question now is whether it can sustain this breakout.",

On the daily timeframe, the stock has formed an RSI divergence, and today it broke above the neckline of this divergence, closing 4.3% higher while reclaiming the 40-day EMA. Additionally, the breakout is supported by an RMI buy signal across all timeframes. However, the stock faced selling pressure towards the end of the session, resulting in a wick formation. The key question now is whether it can sustain this breakout.",
