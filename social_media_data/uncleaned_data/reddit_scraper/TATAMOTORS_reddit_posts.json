I Personally use Finology TICKER for all my research work it is very useful for research work and very simple & easy to use.

The 2 wheeler sector looks attractive and Mahindra(for 4 wheelers and CV) seems to be making all the headlines. But i would like to stay clear of the hype.\n\nFor me TataMotors at the current level (783)  looks attractive with the valuation. It does have slow growth currently, but it may pick up with the new year sales. Also there is room to improve and capture segment in the low cost EV segment if it goes ahead with its plan to bring in another option at the Tiago level. Which may be a direct competitor for Maruti Celerio and others in the segment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dxd9f906xy4e1.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=c06202aa9f3b857f9b1d030cee42d80e72b463d9\n\nAlso with the plan to demerge the PV and CV segment may act as a trigger. \n\nOn the negative side; Trump taking office in January looks bad for cars manufactured outside USA (in the US market).\n\n  \nNote: M&M does look attractive; but the most important reason I am staying away from it is the hype created by the anchors and analyst.",

Look at the trends... Think what will happen vis-a-vis long haul travel vs short haul travel.... Will Tata remain the preferred CV player?\n(b) Will India be a Hybrid play or an EV play.. and within that... Is there really a big differentiation amongst players. If Maruti can just as well catch up to Tata in EV in three years... What are you paying for? (See how post investments by Ford... Chevrolet.. etc.. delta between value of these players and Tesla has come down.)\n\nIf you have convinction in your points... Then go ahead and buy.",

        "selftext": "Hey fellow investors! I'm starting an new challenge to buy 1 stock a day.\n\nThe premise is simple - every day, I'm going to buy 1 stock based on recommendations from the Reddit community. But the amount I invest will depend on how confident I am in the recommendation.\n\nHere's how it will work:\n\n\\- Each day, I'll go through stock recommendations in this post or the series of post in the challenge and do my own research.\n\n\\- Based on that research, I'll decide to buy either:\n\n1. 1 share of the stock\n2. 1,000 rs worth of the stock\n3. 5,000 rs worth of the stock\n4. 10,000 rs worth of the stock\n5. If the stock is above 10k, decision will be based on my discretion.\n\n\\- I'll keep a detailed tracker of every stock I buy - the ticker, people who recommended it, the amount invested, the reasoning behind my investment level, and the stock's performance over time.\n\nThe goal is to see if crowdsourced stock tips from Reddit, combined with my own due diligence, can outperform the market.\n\nSo hit me with your best stock recommendations and let's get investing! Make sure to include a brief explanation of why you think the stock is a good buy. I'll be posting the purchase each day and will be tracking the performance of all the stocks purchased through this challenge.\n\n**Background**:\n\nI have not invested much in Indian stock market and want to get into it. While I have started investing in index funds, I want to get better at stock picking(Haven't done fundamental analysis till date), wanted to see if crowd sourced intelligence is better than big fund managers. More importantly I want to get better at 1. finding good stocks with potential and 2. Doing good due diligence on stocks. I am planning to put up a max of 25l in this challenge in 1 year or about 10k per day.\n\n**Updates**: Thanks everyone for the recommendations, we have 70 recommendations so far, which would cover almost 3 months,  have collated all recommendations into [Recommendations sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b0A-D70QUH6Y1f2ET_MjeSk_iPdG1lPBqkVomums85Q/edit?usp=sharing), please let me know if I have missed anything, will stop scraping this post going forward.\n\n**P.S**: Good that I had already added case for stock above 10k, I am not going to look into elcid investments and MRF.\n\n**P.P.S**: Will update link for day 0 on Monday in this thread.\n\n  \n[Link to day 0 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gubgt7/day_0_buying_1_stock_a_day_based_on_reddit/)",

Achieving this would provide me with a sense of financial security and peace of mind.\n\nTreat me someone who is eager to learn but lacking good network or friends to guide me through these decisions.

        "title": "Good news for Ola and other Indian EVs ",
        "selftext": "China has recently instructed its automakers to avoid making electric vehicle (EV) investments in India, a decision that could significantly impact the growing electric mobility industry in both countries. As\u00a0**EV News 2024**\u00a0develops, this move comes amid heightened geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions between the two nations, and it raises important questions about the future of the electric vehicle sector.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore the reasons behind China\u2019s decision, its potential effects on the\u00a0**Top Electric Vehicles**, and how it might change the landscape of\u00a0[**Top Electric Vehicles News**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/). We\u2019ll also dive into how India\u2019s EV market will evolve without China\u2019s influence and what this could mean for\u00a0**Best Electric Vehicles Price**,\u00a0**Best Electric Vehicles Blogs**, and\u00a0**Top Electric Vehicles Brands**.\n\n# The Geopolitical Context Behind China\u2019s Move\n\nThe decision from the Chinese government comes at a time when relations between India and China are strained due to territorial disputes, economic competition, and growing concerns about trade imbalances. Over the past few years, India has taken steps to reduce its reliance on Chinese products and investments, particularly in critical sectors like telecommunications, infrastructure, and electric vehicles.\n\nThis backdrop of political and economic tension has led China to discourage its automakers from investing in India\u2019s burgeoning EV market. The Chinese government fears that investing in India could expose its companies to risk and undermine its geopolitical standing. This directive has had a direct impact on\u00a0**Top Electric Vehicles Brands**\u00a0and\u00a0**Top Electric Cars Brands**, as many of these brands are looking to expand internationally. India, being one of the\u00a0[**largest emerging EV markets**](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/trends-in-electric-cars), was a prime target for these investments.\n\n# Impact on India\u2019s Electric Vehicle Market\n\nIndia has been rapidly expanding its EV industry, aiming to become a global leader in clean energy and electric mobility. The country has introduced various incentives, subsidies, and schemes to attract both domestic and international investments in its EV sector. China\u2019s decision to halt EV investments could slow down the progress in this sector, particularly for companies that were hoping to leverage Chinese technology and expertise.\n\nWithout the backing of Chinese automakers, Indian manufacturers will need to rely more heavily on domestic resources and partnerships with non-Chinese companies. This could open up opportunities for other global\u00a0**Top Electric Vehicles Brands**, such as Tesla, Rivian, and European automakers, to fill the gap left by Chinese firms. Additionally, Indian startups in the EV space may now have a better shot at capturing a significant share of the market, potentially impacting\u00a0[**Best Electric Vehicles Price**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/top-electric-vehicles-blog/)\u00a0and availability.\n\n# Indian EV Manufacturers to Watch\n\nSeveral Indian companies are already making waves in the\u00a0**Top Electric Vehicles**\u00a0sector, and they are likely to benefit from China\u2019s decision to step back. Key players include:\n\n1. [**Tata Motors**](https://www.tatamotors.com/): A leading name in the\u00a0[**Best Electric SUV**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/what-is-the-best-electric-suv-in-2024/)\u00a0category with the Tata Nexon EV, one of the most popular electric cars in India.\n2. [**Mahindra Electric**](https://www.mahindraelectricautomobile.com/): Known for its commitment to green mobility, Mahindra Electric is one of the strongest competitors in the Indian EV space.\n3. [**Ola Electric**](https://www.olaelectric.com/): Primarily focused on electric two-wheelers, Ola Electric has been making strides in producing the\u00a0**Best Electric Bike**\u00a0and expanding its product range.\n\nThese companies, along with others, will now have a clearer path to dominate India\u2019s EV market, especially as they compete in the\u00a0**Top Electric Cars Price**\u00a0and\u00a0[**Top Electric Vehicles Brands**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/electric-car-showdown-which-is-the-best-under-rs-40-lakh/)\u00a0categories.\n\n# The Influence of Chinese Technology in the EV Sector\n\nChina has long been a global leader in electric vehicle technology, particularly in the development of batteries, charging infrastructure, and electric drivetrains. Chinese companies such as\u00a0[**BYD**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/byd-and-uber-team-up-for-worlds-largest-electric-cars-fleet/),\u00a0[**NIO**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/chinese-ev-nio-aims-to-enter-us-market-with-electric-cars-by-2025/), and\u00a0[**Xpeng**](https://www.xpeng.com/)\u00a0have made significant advancements in these areas, setting the pace for global EV innovation. However, with the recent directive to halt investments in India, these advancements may no longer directly influence India\u2019s EV market.\n\nThe absence of Chinese investments could slow down the adoption of new technologies, such as faster charging solutions and more efficient batteries, both of which are crucial for improving\u00a0[**Top Electric Vehicles reviews**](https://www.edmunds.com/electric-car/)\u00a0and\u00a0**Top Electric cars reviews**\u00a0in India. On the other hand, it could push Indian companies to invest more heavily in their own research and development, fostering innovation from within the country.\n\n# Battery Production and Supply Chain Challenges\n\nOne of the most significant aspects of EV production is battery manufacturing, and China dominates this sector globally. With China discouraging its automakers from investing in India, the Indian EV market could face challenges in sourcing affordable, high-quality batteries. This could drive up costs, potentially impacting\u00a0[**Best Electric Vehicles Price**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/how-affordable-electric-vehicles-can-help-you-beat-high-gas-prices/)\u00a0and making electric cars less affordable for consumers in India.\n\nTo mitigate this, India may need to seek alternative suppliers from countries like South Korea, Japan, and the United States, which are also leaders in battery technology. Expanding domestic battery production could also be a long-term solution, though it would require significant investments and time to scale.\n\n# The Future of Electric Vehicle Infrastructure in India\n\nAnother area where Chinese companies have played a significant role is in the development of EV charging infrastructure. Without their investments, India may struggle to build the necessary infrastructure to support widespread EV adoption.\u00a0[**Best Electric cars Charging Blog 2024**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/)\u00a0posts frequently discuss the importance of fast-charging networks, and while India has made progress, there is still a long way to go.\n\nWith China out of the picture, Indian companies will need to focus on expanding the charging infrastructure. This is a critical component of the EV ecosystem, as consumers are more likely to adopt electric vehicles if they know that charging stations are readily available. To achieve this, partnerships with international companies and government support will be key to ensuring that\u00a0[**India\u2019s EV infrastructure**](https://e-amrit.niti.gov.in/infrastructure)\u00a0can meet the growing demand.\n\n# Potential Opportunities for Other Global Players\n\nChina\u2019s withdrawal from the Indian EV market could create opportunities for other global players to step in. Automakers from the United States, Europe, and Japan could find India a more attractive market without the competition from Chinese companies. This shift could lead to new collaborations, technologies, and innovations entering the Indian market.\n\nCompanies like Tesla, which has been eyeing the Indian market for years, may now have a better chance of establishing a foothold in the country. The\u00a0**Top Electric Vehicles News**\u00a0frequently discusses Tesla\u2019s potential entry into India, and with Chinese competitors stepping back, the timing may be right for Tesla to make its move. Similarly, European automakers like Volkswagen, BMW, and Renault could see this as an opportunity to increase their presence in India\u2019s EV market.\n\n# The Role of Government Policy in Shaping the Future\n\nGovernment policy will play a crucial role in determining how the Indian EV market evolves in the absence of Chinese investments. India\u2019s government has already implemented several initiatives to boost the production and adoption of electric vehicles, including the\u00a0[**Faster Adoption and Manufacturing**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1942506)\u00a0of Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme and tax incentives for EV buyers.\n\nTo ensure that the market continues to grow, the government may need to offer additional incentives to attract foreign investments from non-Chinese companies. This could involve easing regulatory hurdles, offering subsidies for battery production, and investing in EV infrastructure. By doing so, India could maintain its momentum in becoming a global leader in electric mobility, even without Chinese support.\n\n# How Will This Affect Consumers?\n\nFor consumers, China\u2019s decision to restrict EV investments in India could have both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, without Chinese competition, Indian and non-Chinese manufacturers may increase their market share, leading to more choices in\u00a0**Top Electric Vehicles**\u00a0and\u00a0**Top Electric Cars Brands**. This could result in better products and competitive prices as companies vie for dominance.\n\nOn the other hand, the lack of access to Chinese technology and affordable components, particularly batteries, could drive up the\u00a0**Top Electric Cars Price**, making EVs less affordable for the average consumer. In the long run, this may slow down the mass adoption of electric vehicles in India.\n\n# EV Reviews and Consumer Opinions\n\nAs the market evolves, consumer opinions on\u00a0**Top Electric Vehicles reviews**\u00a0and\u00a0**Top Electric cars reviews**\u00a0will be crucial in shaping future trends. Manufacturers will need to focus on delivering high-quality, reliable electric vehicles at affordable prices if they hope to capture the attention of the Indian consumer base.\n\n# Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for India\u2019s EV Market\n\nChina\u2019s decision to halt EV investments in India is a significant development with far-reaching consequences for the electric vehicle industry. While this move may pose challenges in the short term, particularly in terms of technology transfer and battery supply, it also presents opportunities for Indian companies and other global players to step up and fill the gap.\n\nIndia\u2019s electric vehicle market is still on a growth trajectory, with or without Chinese investment. The future of the\u00a0**Best Electric Vehicles Brands**\u00a0and\u00a0[**Best Electric Vehicles Blogs**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/)\u00a0will depend on how well Indian companies adapt to this new landscape, how quickly infrastructure can be developed, and how government policies can support this transition.",

Money flows from one asset class to another, so it would be a wise decision to go behind the money rather than our emotions.

        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nWith the recent launch of Swiggy\u2019s IPO, there\u2019s a lot of buzz around one of India\u2019s biggest food delivery giants going public. But with the current market downturn (Sensex and Nifty both taking a hit), it\u2019s hard not to wonder \u2013 is now really the right time to invest in this IPO? \ud83d\udcc9\n\nSwiggy recently cut its IPO valuation target, reportedly aiming for a lower range due to market conditions. While this may make the entry price more attractive, the broader market trends are making a lot of us cautious. The company has strong brand recognition and a growing market in India, but it\u2019s also been under pressure to turn profitable in a highly competitive space.\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts:\n\n1. **Do you think Swiggy\u2019s valuation and growth potential are strong enough to withstand the current market volatility?**\n2. **What sectors or factors are you prioritizing in this falling market?**\n3. **If you\u2019re investing in this IPO, what\u2019s your strategy? Long-term hold, or are you waiting for a market rebound?**\n\nLet\u2019s get a solid discussion going to help everyone make an informed decision!",

I plan to hold most of these for long term, and I'm trying to accumulate them whenever the market dips. \n\nApart from that I have cash on my hands right now to put in the market and I wanted to ask suggestions about some of the stocks on my watchlist:\n\n* **Defence Stocks**: **HAL,Mazdock and BEL**. They have been projected to do well in the long term but they seem to be extremely overvalued , and have been correcting every now and then these last few weeks. Their quarterly results have been excellent and have been in the news frequently but their momentum right now is confusing and I don't know when to enter\n* **Canara Bank and NMDC**: I found them through a custom screener. They appear to have strong financial strength and are undervalued. Canara Bank shows up in so many 'gowth' screeners and NMDC has been a consistent performer (and also government backed). Yet, they've been falling rapidly the last couple of months. I don't know what's wrong with them. I do plan on having them in my portfolio, but again, confused about entering.\n* **Cipla:** The pharmaceutical industry has been a great, consistent performer as far as the stock market is concerned, and I plan to have exposure to it though Cipla, as it has great financials and a good valuation (good ROCE and divided yield as well)\n* **SBI and ICICI bank:** Held them purely due to some analyst (STRONG BUY) reccomendations, exited them at a minor profit. Don't really know how to analyse bank stocks but they seem to be 'essentials' .\n\n  \n",

I usually wait for my stocks to hit a certain price before I take out the principal amount and the profit remains invested in the stock itself. I try to choose stocks with good fundamentals and have not consistently invested in a stock because I may not have the patience for it right now and also my capital is limited. I know no. of stocks are greater compared to the capital invested but some of my bets take more time to give returns and some are impulse decisions that I intend to cut down.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ld9hhon6nn7d1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c5879dcb970cdd0a5cf39ce40e3e0540a471655\n\nPlease give your valuable suggestions regarding the portfolio and the strategy I use. I am directing all my monthly savings to mutual funds as of now and have stopped putting any money directly in equity.",

Recently, friends advised that having too many MF SIPs can be problematic. They mentioned that the investment amount shouldn't change, but the number of MFs should be fewer. I didn't fully understand this. Are they right? If so, why? Also, if I need to reduce the number of MFs, which SIPs should I keep and which should I let go?\n\n2. **Should I invest less in SIPs and more in stocks?**\n\nI'm 29, and my friends say my risk appetite is higher. However, I prefer long-term investments and don't have the time or expertise to buy/sell stocks regularly. Am I making a mistake by focusing more on SIPs? Should I allocate more to stocks?\n\n3. **Should I consider an SWP?**\n\n4. I have 10 lacs to invest now. Any suggestions on how to allocate this based on my current portfolio?\n\nSorry for the many questions, but I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!",

I don't think multiple ELSS Tax Saver funds are required. Just keep 1 from each category. The reason for not keeping multiple MF's is, different expense ratios can keep eating into your profits.\n2. If you don't have time to analyse and buy/sell stocks, you can continue with your SIP, no problem in that. You mentioned that you are picking stocks based on your friend's suggestions, and that can go horribly wrong. It's your life and your financial goals, so you can take the call about which way you want to go. Nothing wrong with either.",

Reducing debt is a big plus. Value unlocking will happen with PV & CV split in near future. \n\n2.\tMotilal Oswal \u2013 A strong financial company with a good brokerage business, asset management, and housing finance. Currently available at lower than intrinsic value. \n\n3.\tJio Financial \u2013 New but has huge potential with Reliance backing. Expanding into lending, insurance, and digital finance. Only overvalued company on your list. You can average out tamo & motilal and wait for PE of jio fin to come down further and then bring the cost down or swap for better businesses. \n\nIf you believe in them for the long term, buying more when prices dip (averaging down) can help lower your average cost.

I might add more if the correction is steep. \n\nTaMo is facing competitive intensity, but has done well so far, and has a good launch pipeline. The industry is struggling, so stay vigilant, and monitor sales, discounting, inventory levels, and competition. I'll put it on rank 2.

Everyone starts somewhere, don't be discouraged when you see huge amounts being invested here and there subs. \n\nSecondly, you have got some good stock picks there, but try to pick stocks based on your own knowledge and analysis. Don't pay attention to social media hype or tips and recommendations. And as the amount is small dont over diversify stocks, selling those 1 quantity stocks will result in charges and brokerges fees more.\n\nLast but not least, i think you are quiet young, dont invest anymore in individual stock picks now m start a mutual fund instead, like a  Index fund. Keep investing there and, side by side, study how the stock market works more thoroughly. Stock market is a very volatile place, you can gain wealth and lost wealth in the same day hence this advice will suit you for now.",

You can already see it in  Dmart asian paints. Long term is great but 3-5 years at such expensive multiples I doubt any meaningful return of more than 10% on VBL.\n\nIdea is not a 7-10rs stock but a mid and large cap stock. its a wealth destroyer and even ifs the debt gets restructured then business is loosing subscribers on a daily basis and 5-10-20 years down the line I dont know the exact time frame but it will be delisted from the markets.\n\nUNION BANK ? in banking you look beyond PE. its a leveraged business and will you really open a bank account in union bank ? if the answer is no then why on earth you are buying its stock. its a bad investment and a bad bank.\n\ntata motors view I have already written in detail you can take a look into that on indiagrowthstocks\n\nJIO financials the business model is good but its a large cap company and you paying crazy money upfront at 120 pe which means growth of 20-30% for next few years is already factored in the stock.\n\nyou can screen the other stocks on your own using the checklist.",

So your one year plan may not work, if you dont like that idea you should sell and cut losses or stay and be patient.\nJust know tata is actually a perfectly valued stock at the moment compared to its peers.",
