        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%.

Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant.

I've researched most of the stocks on the list.\n\nIn the process of diversifying my portfolio, I've over-diversified and wish to consolidate them to see better gains. I'm in the market for investment since returns here are better than FDs or other safe instruments.\n\nI hope to maximize my returns beating the benchmark in the longer run and have tried to mix large cap, mid cap, and small cap. I wanted to simply put in around 15L and forget about them for the next few years but I've come across terms like re-balancing and wonder if I should re-strategize my approach.\n\nInvestment horizon -> 5-7 years.  \nFOMO stocks - Mazagon, Suzlon.\n\nI'd really appreciate if some of you could point me in the right direction in the above objective and if there are other (sector) stocks I could add.\n\nThank you and happy investing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5t58bmdyjjd1.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc1bbe7fcc3cddd5e486493f6c011d6a420d6eec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgul6amdyjjd1.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20ab1656d957fa33f67657e7cbd237ba1535a7ba\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/obnk5jmdyjjd1.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2894d20b4fa3589ee8620ad8fd841867a2a8569\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/elnhqamdyjjd1.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fba57e314a6cc49a22b9c9127bd8135f74153ca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p1dr65ndyjjd1.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bfd9b5426e0ce97b5f478ad3867fb4f4e23fae6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0j1r3cmdyjjd1.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1615a41194e6d472ce1689b561e88fb8946370e4\n\nUPDATE: Mazagon was sold on 2024-08-20",

I know i have taken a risky trade but before june tariffs wont be implemented, and anyhow pharma sector will rise back up due to more demand, in the short run, cause US dosent have any shit resources to make its pharma industry produce in 2-3 months.

Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%. However, Nifty Pharma performed well with a 1.55% weekly gain.\n\n **Lets analyze the NIFTY pharma it stocks with the help of RRG** \n\n**Leading Quadrant:** JBCHEPHARMA, MANKIND, NATCOPHARM, GRANULES, DRREDDY, LUPIN, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are currently in the Leading Quadrant. However, LUPIN, NATCOPHARM, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are losing momentum and heading toward the Weakening Quadrant. \n\n**Weakening Quadrant:** LAURUSLABS, BIOCON, TORENTPHARMA, and ABBOTINDIA are positioned in the Weakening Quadrant. Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant. In contrast, LAURUSLABS and BIOCON are exhibiting high negative strength and are drifting toward the Lagging Quadrant.\n\n **Lagging Quadrant:** DIVISLAB, CIPLA, AJANTAPHARMA, ALKEM, and GLAND are in the Lagging Quadrant. Notably, all the stocks, except DIVISLAB, are showing signs of recovery and are attempting to move toward the Improving Quadrant. \n\n**Improving Quadrant:** AUROPHARMA, GLENMARK, and IPCA are in the Improving Quadrant. While AUROPHARMA and GLENMARK are progressing with strong positive momentum, IPCA is struggling to transition into the Leading Quadrant.",

Separately, of course, I have a personal equity portfolio as well \u2014 in that, I have been investing ~40% of my capital based on momentum factor for the past couple of years and that has beat the broader market indices by a decent margin. \n\nBeginning today, in this thread, I\u2019ll post top 10 stocks from Nifty50 which are currently experiencing high momentum. I\u2019ll update this list on a weekly basis. \n\nIf I see interest in these lists, I\u2019ll post high momentum stocks from small- and mid-caps as well. I have a couple of smallcases as well (freely available) that are also based on momentum tracking. These have given 79% and 20% returns in the past 14 months and 4 months, respectively. \n\nDisclaimer: THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE. I\u2019M NOT A SEBI REGISTERED ENTITY. I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE PERSONAL POSITIONS IN SOME OF THESE STOCKS. THIS IS ALL FOR EDUCATIONAL DISCUSSION ONLY.",

I\u2019ve done quite a few trades since then and booked a lot of profit (something like INR 50L YTD)\n\n\nIt\u2019s been another 2 good quarters of returns, outperforming all benchmark indices. \n\n\nMy biggest learning? It\u2019s rare to outperform a bull market, because everyone is winning. Major outperformance happens in a bear market. If you\u2019ve invested in fundamentally good stocks, they\u2019re not going to fall as fast as the market. And they\u2019ll rise when the market returns - that\u2019s where you get that extra 5-10% a year.\n\n\nIf things go as expected, this should be another year with 30%+ returns (currently at 25% YTD).\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next: I want to buy into a couple of core export-oriented stocks. The rupee depreciation will show very positively in their quarterly results. Anyone got a recommendation? (mandatory DYOR for everyone)\n\n\nHappy to take questions and help out in whatever way possible, good people.\n\n\nP.S. I don\u2019t sell courses, I don\u2019t teach trading, I despise fake YT gurus, I don\u2019t want to be one. F em all",

Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%. However, Nifty Pharma performed well with a 1.55% weekly gain.\n\n**Lets analyze the NIFTY pharma it stocks with the help of RRG**\n\n**Leading Quadrant:**\u00a0JBCHEPHARMA, MANKIND, NATCOPHARM, GRANULES, DRREDDY, LUPIN, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are currently in the Leading Quadrant. However, LUPIN, NATCOPHARM, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are losing momentum and heading toward the Weakening Quadrant.\n\n**Weakening Quadrant:**\u00a0LAURUSLABS, BIOCON, TORENTPHARMA, and ABBOTINDIA are positioned in the Weakening Quadrant. Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant. In contrast, LAURUSLABS and BIOCON are exhibiting high negative strength and are drifting toward the Lagging Quadrant.\n\n**Lagging Quadrant:**\u00a0DIVISLAB, CIPLA, AJANTAPHARMA, ALKEM, and GLAND are in the Lagging Quadrant. Notably, all the stocks, except DIVISLAB, are showing signs of recovery and are attempting to move toward the Improving Quadrant.\n\n**Improving Quadrant:**\u00a0AUROPHARMA, GLENMARK, and IPCA are in the Improving Quadrant. While AUROPHARMA and GLENMARK are progressing with strong positive momentum, IPCA is struggling to transition into the Leading Quadrant.\n\n",
