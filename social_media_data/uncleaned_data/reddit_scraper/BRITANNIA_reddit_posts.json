        "selftext": "Jio Financial Services Limited (JFSL) was listed in August 2023 after being demerged from Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) to unlock the value of RIL\u2019s financial services business.\n\nJFSL formed a joint venture with BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset management company. Both parties committed to investing $300 million (\u20b92,500 crore) each as an initial investment to build a \u201cdigital-first asset management business.\u201d\n\nAll of this seems promising, but what exactly is Jio Finance trying to become? As of now, only \u20b9117 crore has been invested in JFSL, with more to come over the next several years. It is currently expanding into multiple sectors:\n\n1. Asset & Wealth Management.\n\n\t\tSEBI has approved JFSL to launch its first mutual fund in 2025.\n\n2. Lending & Credit Services.\n\n\t\tPlans to offer consumer loans, SME financing, and secured loans.\n\n3. Insurance.\n\n\t\tExploring potential entry into life, health, and general insurance with a digital-first approach.\n\n4. Payments & Banking. \n\n\t    Jio Payments Bank, a joint venture with SBI, is already operational, offering UPI and banking services.\n\n5. Stock Broking & Advisory.\n\n\t      Launched Jio BlackRock Broking Private Limited to offer stock trading and advisory services.\n\n6. NBFC.\n\n\t\tJFSL has NBFC status, allowing it to lend directly without being a bank.\n\t\tExpected to enter housing finance, auto loans, and SME loans.\n\nHere's where the real uncertainty comes. JFSL is in every sector and no doubt might disrupt this too being a conglomerate but a company like jio which is barely operational is replacing Bharat Petroleum a well established company\n\nWhile JFSL is expanding aggressively, its business strategy lacks clear direction.\n\nJFSL holds a 6.1% stake in Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). With RIL\u2019s current market cap at \u20b917.4 lakh crore, JFSL\u2019s stake alone is worth nearly \u20b91.4 lakh crore.\n\nHowever, JFSL\u2019s own market cap was initially just \u20b920,000 crore, which means that its valuation was massively inflated due to its RIL stake, rather than its core financial services business.\n\nJFSL is trying to enter every financial sector at once, asset management, broking, lending, payments, insurance, NBFC, and fintech instead of focusing on one vertical and expanding from there\n\nEven its Jio BlackRock AMC got SEBI approval, yet the mutual fund is still not operational, and its revenues, profits, and assets remain uncertain and nothing is sure about the company's balance sheet yet about what's happening.\n\n\nAdded to Nifty 50 But Does It Deserve It?\n\nDespite its lack of execution, JFSL will be added to the Nifty 50 on March 28, 2025, replacing BPCL.\n\nZomato will replace Britannia in the same reshuffle, might make a post on it later.\n\nJFSL\u2019s inclusion is primarily based on its free-float market capitalization, not its financial performance.\n\nIt recently corrected due to overvaluation. Despite holding only 6.1% of RIL, it was given an inflated market cap and is now being added to Nifty 50.\n\n\nJio Financial Services just seems to me like a reliance backed company without any plans in the near future just going into every sector possible but at this point the company just seems too new to be added to the nifty 50, what are your thoughts?",

I stopped taking very strong positions. I took 3 lot of options and equity for Asian paints, lost a lot of money.\n\nNow I take 1 lot of future OR options OR equity.\n\n2. I tried to do 'in the money' trade, took put for Asian paints when it went down heavily.\nI made some money back that way, but ended up losing all that money and more.\n\nI also learnt that FnO aren't as liquid as equity. Even if I was putting in the same value as the market price, order was taking too long to execute.\nSo no more unnecessary risk.\n\n3. I was in a good position with a Britannia future, it was going upto some 19k profit.\nI had to present in an office meeting and got 5 minutes delayed after the result, it started plummeting.\n\nI tried to sell a couple of times but no buyers. Finally sold it for a measly profit of 1.5k.\nDamn near broke my heart.\n\nThis teaches me to prioritise result announcement time over anything else.\n\nBad trades come and go but Hopefully I'll be more careful and not lose anymore money out of stupidity.\n\nPlease share some learnings for me.",

Actually the crude oil contract in MCX used to be so liquid that foreign traders used to trade on it. But of course SEBI did not like that. Also, RBI outright banned the currency market in April. You can check the volume on that now. It is a ghost town.\n\nAfter Nov 20 it will get so much worse. The common theme is that SEBI does not like F&O and they are slowly killing it in India. Now they are talking about banning retailers from F&I entirely, only HNIs allowed. Derivatives market in India is slowly dying.",

        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

The conditions in our GTT orders are trigger prices, and once those are met, the order is executed as a limit order based on the set price. This approach is in place for compliance reasons and to protect users from unfavourable executions due to high-impact costs. \n\nThat said, we recognise your concerns and are actively working on a solution to give users more control over their execution price. Your input is valuable, and we appreciate your patience as we work to improve the feature. Thank you.",

Of course I have churned my portfolio over the years, booked a lot of profits and reinvested the gains. I have a cash position of \\~7L which is my \"opportunity fund\". The percentage in the \"unrealised gains\" column is actually XIRR (so you get an idea of how old the investment is).\n\nMy investments over the past 1 year I have marked with a red \"X\". Should I take more risks and allocate a bigger share of my portfolio to small caps?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9aufztxlgiqd1.jpg?width=2465&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b60f74c3f20c4b063f2b76671ad0272a7183dfc\n\n",

I mean whatever growth you are looking, I think you can get a lot more by other fmcg shares rather than nestle and tata consumer. LT foods is nice bet which if goes well can make you good returns but still one strong fundamental that I would look for is itc. I know very controversial and many don't like it but the demerger will improve their balance sheet. Their current return on assets will improve too, since the current balance sheet contains huge capex of their hotel business too so we can evaluate better once the demerger happens. \n\nTata consumer isn't bad stock either but at current levels or recent levels it is over valued and not sure how much returns expected from here. VBL is amazing buy!   \nAnd Asian paints, margins will suffer for sure moving ahead and even I was holding it at good levels but I moved out from it and invested same amount in some other stock which is growing at faster rate. \n\nMy main focus is on stock should not be that large that growth is minimal, I know risk should be managed too but still. That is just my perspective, everyone have their own style and I respect each one of the view as long as it has rationale behind it. \n\nGood luck, would be happy to answer any questions if any",

What are your thoughts on this? Kindly guide me.\n\n\nPersonal context : I am 28, No loan in my name, been investing for 5 years so far, credit score is good (781+) and not doing any trading or other stuff.",

But cycles do change and when it does the stock will be a beneficiary of the INDIAN CONSUMPTION STORY .The support lines are drawn in blue (for ease ).Even if it reaches its all the high in let's say in 2 years that's still a 18 percent CAGR .Suitable for investors who have atleast a 1.5 year horizon and want to take minimal risk .

Additionally, I can manage to pay off my loan in a few months (maximum 4-5 months).\n\nI would appreciate your guidance on whether this is a good decision and any advice or suggestions you might have. \n\n\nI\u2019m planning to invest between October and December, and I intend to hold some investments until the U.S. election period and results. What are your thoughts on this? Kindly guide me.\n\n\n\nPersonal context : I am 28, No loan in my name, been investing for 5 years so far, credit score is good (781+) and not doing any trading or other stuff.",
