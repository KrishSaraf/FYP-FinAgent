        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money.

I'm not chasing high returns right now. Even 12/13/14% is fine for me for now. Investing for long term only (5+ years).  \nSince I don't know many technical details, I just check the graph. If the stock has shown consistent growth over the last 5 to 10 years, I invest in it.  \nLike: Reliance, Cipla, Indigo, TCS, Nestle. 70% of my stock investment is in such companies only.  \nI'm not investing in such companies which suddenly go very high in  1-2  years, (and might later fall more abruptly).\n\nMy question is, is this approach ok? Just looking at the historic growth chart, no other analysis.  \nI'll be learning more things slowly and check other things, but that will take time. And I don't want to miss this dip actually.  \n\n\nTIA",

Many farmers, expect rains to do farming, lack of rain will lead to drought, (even though temporarily borewells can be used, ground water levels will also get affected due to lack of rain).. so the cost of basic grains, vegetables..etc will hike adding to the existing inflation.. which means people will spend major of their income for basic needs, there won't be spending for other items thus market will slowdown..  Also water scarcity in cities will increase.. Cost of amenities will increase.. Thus less spending on other stuff.. Scarcity will also bring in contamination thus diseases..again no money for spending..   Say a family which does thrice monthly outing will reduce it to once or twice.. When domestic budget people will spend less on no essential items like clothings, apparels, movies, tourism, fast foods..etc  so when people reduce buying companies will have hard time increasing their profit, seeing this stagnant state, large investors will pull out their money and invest it elsewhere outside..",

Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%. However, Nifty Pharma performed well with a 1.55% weekly gain.\n\n**Lets analyze the NIFTY pharma it stocks with the help of RRG**\n\n**Leading Quadrant:**\u00a0JBCHEPHARMA, MANKIND, NATCOPHARM, GRANULES, DRREDDY, LUPIN, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are currently in the Leading Quadrant. However, LUPIN, NATCOPHARM, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are losing momentum and heading toward the Weakening Quadrant.\n\n**Weakening Quadrant:**\u00a0LAURUSLABS, BIOCON, TORENTPHARMA, and ABBOTINDIA are positioned in the Weakening Quadrant. Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant. In contrast, LAURUSLABS and BIOCON are exhibiting high negative strength and are drifting toward the Lagging Quadrant.\n\n**Lagging Quadrant:**\u00a0DIVISLAB, CIPLA, AJANTAPHARMA, ALKEM, and GLAND are in the Lagging Quadrant. Notably, all the stocks, except DIVISLAB, are showing signs of recovery and are attempting to move toward the Improving Quadrant.\n\n**Improving Quadrant:**\u00a0AUROPHARMA, GLENMARK, and IPCA are in the Improving Quadrant. While AUROPHARMA and GLENMARK are progressing with strong positive momentum, IPCA is struggling to transition into the Leading Quadrant.",

I plan to hold most of these for long term, and I'm trying to accumulate them whenever the market dips. \n\nApart from that I have cash on my hands right now to put in the market and I wanted to ask suggestions about some of the stocks on my watchlist:\n\n* **Defence Stocks**: **HAL,Mazdock and BEL**. They have been projected to do well in the long term but they seem to be extremely overvalued , and have been correcting every now and then these last few weeks. Their quarterly results have been excellent and have been in the news frequently but their momentum right now is confusing and I don't know when to enter\n* **Canara Bank and NMDC**: I found them through a custom screener. They appear to have strong financial strength and are undervalued. Canara Bank shows up in so many 'gowth' screeners and NMDC has been a consistent performer (and also government backed). Yet, they've been falling rapidly the last couple of months. I don't know what's wrong with them. I do plan on having them in my portfolio, but again, confused about entering.\n* **Cipla:** The pharmaceutical industry has been a great, consistent performer as far as the stock market is concerned, and I plan to have exposure to it though Cipla, as it has great financials and a good valuation (good ROCE and divided yield as well)\n* **SBI and ICICI bank:** Held them purely due to some analyst (STRONG BUY) reccomendations, exited them at a minor profit. Don't really know how to analyse bank stocks but they seem to be 'essentials' .\n\n  \n",

Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%. However, Nifty Pharma performed well with a 1.55% weekly gain.\n\n **Lets analyze the NIFTY pharma it stocks with the help of RRG** \n\n**Leading Quadrant:** JBCHEPHARMA, MANKIND, NATCOPHARM, GRANULES, DRREDDY, LUPIN, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are currently in the Leading Quadrant. However, LUPIN, NATCOPHARM, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are losing momentum and heading toward the Weakening Quadrant. \n\n**Weakening Quadrant:** LAURUSLABS, BIOCON, TORENTPHARMA, and ABBOTINDIA are positioned in the Weakening Quadrant. Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant. In contrast, LAURUSLABS and BIOCON are exhibiting high negative strength and are drifting toward the Lagging Quadrant.\n\n **Lagging Quadrant:** DIVISLAB, CIPLA, AJANTAPHARMA, ALKEM, and GLAND are in the Lagging Quadrant. Notably, all the stocks, except DIVISLAB, are showing signs of recovery and are attempting to move toward the Improving Quadrant. \n\n**Improving Quadrant:** AUROPHARMA, GLENMARK, and IPCA are in the Improving Quadrant. While AUROPHARMA and GLENMARK are progressing with strong positive momentum, IPCA is struggling to transition into the Leading Quadrant.",

With the entry of private equity into the Indian healthcare sector and rising medical inflation, I am bullish on healthcare for the long term. I have shortlisted the following stocks:\n\n1. Cipla - \n    Large cap, PE: 30, Debt/Equity: 0.02, ROE: 15%, EPS: 53\n\n\n2. Aster DM - \n    Small cap, PE: 4, Debt/Equity: 0.3, ROE: 2.84% only, EPS: 105\n\n\n3. Narayana Hrudayalaya - \n    Small cap, PE: 31.55, Debt/Equity: 0.56, ROE: 27%, EPS: 39\n\n\n4. Kovai Medical - \n    Very small cap, PE: 30, Debt/Equity: 0.35, ROE:  20%, EPS: 177\n\n\n\nI am not including stocks like Apollo Hospitals and Max Healthcare at the moment, as they are already overpriced (PE around 100). However, I might consider Fortis.\n\nWhat should be the allocation percentage in these stocks?",

Basically,if you bought 100 shares of it,you've put 1.5l or so at stake and you're stoploss would be around the low of the consolidation,around some 30-40 ticks,and if you want a looser stop at best 50 ticks at 1450,below which there will be a downmove in earnest atleast briefly until 1400 levels. All,I'm saying is you'll find less risky bets at lower price bands. If you're starting out,50-600 or 700rs ka stock band se try karlo,aur the higher the price lower the allocation se start off. At the end of the day,it's a gamble,atleast let your instincts get sharper before you touch high stakes like these. When you're doing better and see good profits and your chart eye is more honed,take concentrated bets in expensive stocks. Sorry if I offended you or spoke out of line. I just wish someone had told me this when I'd started out. Have a nice day",

Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%. However, Nifty Pharma performed well with a 1.55% weekly gain.\n\n**Lets analyze the NIFTY pharma it stocks with the help of RRG**\n\n**Leading Quadrant:**\u00a0JBCHEPHARMA, MANKIND, NATCOPHARM, GRANULES, DRREDDY, LUPIN, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are currently in the Leading Quadrant. However, LUPIN, NATCOPHARM, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are losing momentum and heading toward the Weakening Quadrant.\n\n**Weakening Quadrant:**\u00a0LAURUSLABS, BIOCON, TORENTPHARMA, and ABBOTINDIA are positioned in the Weakening Quadrant. Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant. In contrast, LAURUSLABS and BIOCON are exhibiting high negative strength and are drifting toward the Lagging Quadrant.\n\n**Lagging Quadrant:**\u00a0DIVISLAB, CIPLA, AJANTAPHARMA, ALKEM, and GLAND are in the Lagging Quadrant. Notably, all the stocks, except DIVISLAB, are showing signs of recovery and are attempting to move toward the Improving Quadrant.\n\n**Improving Quadrant:**\u00a0AUROPHARMA, GLENMARK, and IPCA are in the Improving Quadrant. While AUROPHARMA and GLENMARK are progressing with strong positive momentum, IPCA is struggling to transition into the Leading Quadrant.\n\n",

        "selftext": "\nWhat stocks do you invest in regularly (SIP)?\n\nMy top three picks would be:\n\n1. ITC Limited\n2. Tips Industries Limited\n3. PNGS Gargi Fashion Jewellery Limited\n\nThe rationality behind these picks is growth over momentum. ITC Limited is a stock that holds the portfolio together in bad times. The dividend yield is also pretty impressive. Though it is a very old enterprise, I still believe that it has potential to grow and deliver decent returns. I hope the proposed demerger unlocks wealthy to investor.\n\nTips Industries Limited is a cash rich company that rewards regularly by way of dividends and buy-backs. The music industry is growing and people have started to pay for streaming it. There is some stability in revenues as the company has minimum guarantee deals with global record labels. By demerging the films division, the risk is transferred to the new company, making music the core business for the company. I also think their accounting practices are conservative as 100% costs are written-off in the year of release, thereby keeping the balance sheet light weight.\n\nPNGSGFJ Limited is by far the riskiest amongst the three. It is still a relatively small and new company (market capitalization is less than \u20b91,000 crores), yet poised for growth. The name P.N. Gadgil & Sons is a symbol of excellence and trust. The company enjoys this brand legacy. The organized jewellery business is slowly taking over mom-and-pop stores. As a society we are experiencing more women participation in the work force. This leaves women with more disposable income that will further boost the jewellery business. This company is rapidly expanding its physical presence across tier 1 cities. Consumers desire affordable, high quality, fashionable accessories and this company checks all the boxes.\n\nI am eager to know your picks for SIP. That's my two cents, thank you.",
