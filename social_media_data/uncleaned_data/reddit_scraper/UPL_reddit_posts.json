It generally means company is raising funds and gives you the option of buying rights issues after cutting a portion from your current share price.\n\nBasically, if you own a percentage of the company before  the rights  issue, you are  paying to maintain that same percentage.\n\nI would exit any stock that  announces rights issue, and probably buy the stock/ rights issue after  it come along if I want to continue believing in the company.\n\nSo, no it is not really profitable.\n\nIt is possible to increase your holdings tho if you  can buy the rights issue shares and pay the premium also and have it cheaper than the actual stock.

Generate infinite shares, sell for infinite money.\n\nIf a company sells a billion shares, it\u2019s just splitting the same limited pie into a billion pieces. The total size of the pie remains the same. So of course there isn\u2019t going to be any infinite money.\n\nBut because of this infinite shares creation ability, companies can shrink the size of the piece of the pie with any particular shareholder. If I own 10 shares of a company with 100 shares, and the company magically creates another 900 shares and sells them to its favourite people, those people now have 900 while I\u2019m stuck with the same 10.\n\nThere are safeguards against this kind of stuff and it\u2019s not something that usually happens. I probably wouldn\u2019t be writing about it if it did usually happen. Late in December, SEBI\u00a0[issued an order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/dec-2024/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-bharat-global-developers-limited_90114.html)\u00a0against Bharat Global Developers, a 30-year old company whose only reason for existence was its capacity to defraud individual investors.\n\nBharat Global ran a classic pump-and-dump, and the first thing you do to run a pump-and-dump is hoard up on the shares of the company you\u2019re pumping. From SEBI\u2019s order:\n\n>\\[\u2026\\] the Company made two preferential allotment of shares \u2013 9.72 crore shares in April 2024 to 31 allottees and 35 lakh shares in August 2024 to 10 allottees. These large preferential allotments resulted in 99.5% of the shareholding being concentrated in the hands of these 41 allottees\u2026\n\nBharat Global sold more than 10 crore (100 million) shares to 41 of its favourite people. These 10 crore shares were the entire company! 99.5% of it at least. 99.5% is quite a sweet spot if you\u2019re looking to do a pump-and-dump.\n\n# The pump and the dump\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken about the general mechanics of a pump-and-dump\u00a0[before](https://boringmoney.in/p/youtube-is-great-for-pump-and-dumps#:~:text=The%20mechanics%20of%20it%20are%20known%20and%20simple%3A). It\u2019s reasonably straightforward:\n\n1. Find a relatively unknown company. Buy as many of its shares as you can.\n2. Scream your lungs out! The nicer the story about the company, the better.\n3. People thinking they\u2019re great stock pickers will buy the shares of the company. This is a dumb illiquid stock, so its price will shoot up.\n4. Sell to the suckers.\n5. ??? Profit.\n\nBharat Global sold the bulk of its shares in April 2024, first starting with 31 people. This was a \u20b997 crore sale. In August 2024, it sold another batch of shares to 10 more people for \u20b973 crore.\n\nWhen a company sells its shares in a \u201cpreferential allotment\u201d or in better words, to people that it chooses to, those people cannot sell their shares to the public right away. They\u2019re locked in for 6 months to ensure that the company isn\u2019t just distributing free money, and so that public investors have some time to evaluate and react to the company\u2019s actions.\n\nThe 31 people who bought Bharat Global\u2019s shares in April couldn\u2019t sell until at least October. As soon as October hit, the company started screaming its lungs out with announcements. Here\u2019s a slice of the kind of disclosures it made:\n\n1. \u20b9300 crore order! For potatoes! From McCain India Agro Pvt Ltd. Yeah, the frozen fries company.\n2. \u20b9650 crore order! From Tata Agro & Consumer Products. For tea leaves and dry fruits.\n3. \u20b9156 crore order! From UPL Agro\u2014groundnuts to extract oil from!\n4. A \u20b9120 crore order from Reliance Industries Ltd! For designing, engineering and constructing a refinery component.\n\nI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to say it, but all these orders were fake. SEBI went to each company and asked them about the orders. The companies from the disclosures don\u2019t even exist! Bharat Global just added a random \u201cAgro\u201d at the end of a bunch of popular companies\u2019 names to make their fake orders sound fancy.\n\nBetween 30th October and 11th December, 13 of Bharat Global\u2019s favourite 41 who were now out of the lock in, sold their shares. They made a massive \u20b9272 crore ($31 million) in profit. Here\u2019s an example of the scale of the profit:\n\n>One of the preferential allottees, namely Mahadev Manubhai Makvana who was allotted 37,82,000 shares in the first allotment, is also the Authorised Signatory in respect of two bank accounts of BGDL with Yes Bank and Axis Bank. The account opening date for Yes Bank was March 20, 2024. He offloaded 4,97,359 BGDL shares for INR 70,71,94,153 between November 01, 2024 and December 20, 2024, making a profit of approximately INR 70,22,20,563 against an investment of approximately INR 49,73,590.\n\nMahadev Manubhai Makvana (MMM?) invested \u20b949 lakh ($57k) and made \u20b970 crore ($8M). 155 times the initial investment! Uff.\n\nSEBI also discovered that MMM\u00a0*was*\u00a0Bharat Global. His name was on one of the company\u2019s bank accounts! If you\u2019re running a pump-and-dump, maybe don\u2019t put your name on the bank account of the company you\u2019re pumping.\n\nBoring Money is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\n# And then there was Reliance\n\nOf the four fake disclosures I highlighted, one is not the same as the others. When SEBI wrote to Reliance to figure out if they had indeed placed a \u20b9120 crore order with Bharat Global, here\u2019s what it got:\n\n>RIL submitted vide e-mail dated December 19, 2024 that BGDL had not supplied any material for the FCC project of RIL\u2019s refinery. RIL further submitted that BGDL (formerly known as Kkrrafton Developers Limited) had supplied only general construction materials to RIL for about INR 155 crore (including taxes) during the period from April 01, 2024 to September 30, 2024 which was not related to the FCC project.\n\nBharat Global\u2019s announcement about a \u20b9120 crore order was false, no surprises there, but Reliance told SEBI that there was\u00a0*another*\u00a0\u20b9155 crore order which was apparently legitimate and fulfilled?!\n\nBizarre. Very bizarre. Bharat Global was a company whose revenue was literally 0 for many years before it turned into a money grabbing vehicle. It lied about having subsidiaries which did not exist. The company changed its name 4 times in its lifetime. (Probably picked the name \u201cBharat Global\u201d because of how patriotic the pumpers-and-dumpers were.)\n\nThere was no business! There was never a business! All its disclosures were fake. And yet, somehow, out of nowhere, not only did it have a real \u20b9155 crore order from Reliance, but it also\u00a0*chose to*\u00a0make up a fake order when it could very well have just disclosed the real one instead?\n\nI think this takes the cake for anything I\u2019ve written until now. And I\u2019ve written about some\u00a0[weird stuff](https://boringmoney.in/p/embassy-reit-looks-at-a-fraud#:~:text=suspicious%20was%20suspicious.-,FIT%20AND%20PROPER,-If%20you%20were). I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. SEBI needs to jump on this thread and find some answers. But hey, until then, maybe I can guess?\n\nHere\u2019s some stuff about Reliance\u2019s payments from SEBI\u2019s order:\n\n>\u2026 data submitted by RIL shows that a payment of INR 57.22 crore was made to Kkrrafton Developers Limited on March 16, 2024, another 8.07 crore on March 19, 2024 and a last payment of INR 28.04 crore on August 12, 2024.\n\nand,\n\n>\\[\u2026\\] In this regard, from the bank statements of BGDL obtained from Indian Bank, it was observed that RIL made advance payments of Rs. 65.29 crore to BGDL in March 2024.\n\nReliance paid Bharat Global \u20b965 crore in advance and before it even raised an invoice for that money! In all, Reliance paid the company at \u20b993 crore, with the last payment in August. Now come on, Reliance is known to be pretty cut-throat, always getting the better half of a deal. Paying a zero-revenue company \u20b965 crore before it\u2019s even asked to doesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\nLet\u2019s put these events down in chronological order:\n\n1. In March 2024, Reliance paid Bharat Global \u20b965 crore out of the goodness of its heart.\n2. The next month in April, Bharat Global allotted shares worth \u20b997 crore to its favourite people.\n3. In August, Reliance paid another \u20b928 crore.\n4. Later in the same month, Bharat Global allotted another \u20b973 crore worth of shares to its favourite people.\n5. The money that Reliance paid Bharat Global did not show up in Bharat Global\u2019s financial statements.\n\nIs there a connection between the money Reliance paid Bharat Global and the money that Bharat Global\u2019s favourite people paid it? I don\u2019t know. Were those people really using Reliance\u2019s money to run a pump-and-dump? I have absolutely no idea. \\[1\\]\n\n# Playing saviour\n\nThe people that bought Bharat Global\u2019s shares in its second sale in August were to be locked in until February 2025. By late December, just before SEBI stepped in, Bharat Global\u2019s pumped-up price was at \u20b91300\u20146X the price that the August buyers got the shares at.\n\nThis post would\u2019ve probably been a two-part pump-and-dump series, had SEBI not identified the first pump-and-dump in time. For now, the 13 folks that made the \u20b9272 crore profit will have to give the money back. And the others that couldn\u2019t sell Bharat Global\u2019s shares in time will be stuck holding the bag.\u00a0\\[2\\]\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I really mean this! There are a lot of unknowns.\n\n\\[2\\] In the process of writing this I discovered that some of the 41 people are very obviously involved in other pump-and-dumps as well. Attempts at them, at least, if not successful ones. I\u2019ll probably write about it in a future MYSTERY POST.",

Generate infinite shares, sell for infinite money.\n\nIf a company sells a billion shares, it\u2019s just splitting the same limited pie into a billion pieces. The total size of the pie remains the same. So of course there isn\u2019t going to be any infinite money.\n\nBut because of this infinite shares creation ability, companies can shrink the size of the piece of the pie with any particular shareholder. If I own 10 shares of a company with 100 shares, and the company magically creates another 900 shares and sells them to its favourite people, those people now have 900 while I\u2019m stuck with the same 10.\n\nThere are safeguards against this kind of stuff and it\u2019s not something that usually happens. I probably wouldn\u2019t be writing about it if it did usually happen. Late in December, SEBI\u00a0[issued an order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/dec-2024/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-bharat-global-developers-limited_90114.html)\u00a0against Bharat Global Developers, a 30-year old company whose only reason for existence was its capacity to defraud individual investors.\n\nBharat Global ran a classic pump-and-dump, and the first thing you do to run a pump-and-dump is hoard up on the shares of the company you\u2019re pumping. From SEBI\u2019s order:\n\n>\\[\u2026\\] the Company made two preferential allotment of shares \u2013 9.72 crore shares in April 2024 to 31 allottees and 35 lakh shares in August 2024 to 10 allottees. These large preferential allotments resulted in 99.5% of the shareholding being concentrated in the hands of these 41 allottees\u2026\n\nBharat Global sold more than 10 crore (100 million) shares to 41 of its favourite people. These 10 crore shares were the entire company! 99.5% of it at least. 99.5% is quite a sweet spot if you\u2019re looking to do a pump-and-dump.\n\n# The pump and the dump\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken about the general mechanics of a pump-and-dump\u00a0[before](https://boringmoney.in/p/youtube-is-great-for-pump-and-dumps#:~:text=The%20mechanics%20of%20it%20are%20known%20and%20simple%3A). It\u2019s reasonably straightforward:\n\n1. Find a relatively unknown company. Buy as many of its shares as you can.\n2. Scream your lungs out! The nicer the story about the company, the better.\n3. People thinking they\u2019re great stock pickers will buy the shares of the company. This is a dumb illiquid stock, so its price will shoot up.\n4. Sell to the suckers.\n5. ??? Profit.\n\nBharat Global sold the bulk of its shares in April 2024, first starting with 31 people. This was a \u20b997 crore sale. In August 2024, it sold another batch of shares to 10 more people for \u20b973 crore.\n\nWhen a company sells its shares in a \u201cpreferential allotment\u201d or in better words, to people that it chooses to, those people cannot sell their shares to the public right away. They\u2019re locked in for 6 months to ensure that the company isn\u2019t just distributing free money, and so that public investors have some time to evaluate and react to the company\u2019s actions.\n\nThe 31 people who bought Bharat Global\u2019s shares in April couldn\u2019t sell until at least October. As soon as October hit, the company started screaming its lungs out with announcements. Here\u2019s a slice of the kind of disclosures it made:\n\n1. \u20b9300 crore order! For potatoes! From McCain India Agro Pvt Ltd. Yeah, the frozen fries company.\n2. \u20b9650 crore order! From Tata Agro & Consumer Products. For tea leaves and dry fruits.\n3. \u20b9156 crore order! From UPL Agro\u2014groundnuts to extract oil from!\n4. A \u20b9120 crore order from Reliance Industries Ltd! For designing, engineering and constructing a refinery component.\n\nI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to say it, but all these orders were fake. SEBI went to each company and asked them about the orders. The companies from the disclosures don\u2019t even exist! Bharat Global just added a random \u201cAgro\u201d at the end of a bunch of popular companies\u2019 names to make their fake orders sound fancy.\n\nBetween 30th October and 11th December, 13 of Bharat Global\u2019s favourite 41 who were now out of the lock in, sold their shares. They made a massive \u20b9272 crore ($31 million) in profit. Here\u2019s an example of the scale of the profit:\n\n>One of the preferential allottees, namely Mahadev Manubhai Makvana who was allotted 37,82,000 shares in the first allotment, is also the Authorised Signatory in respect of two bank accounts of BGDL with Yes Bank and Axis Bank. The account opening date for Yes Bank was March 20, 2024. He offloaded 4,97,359 BGDL shares for INR 70,71,94,153 between November 01, 2024 and December 20, 2024, making a profit of approximately INR 70,22,20,563 against an investment of approximately INR 49,73,590.\n\nMahadev Manubhai Makvana (MMM?) invested \u20b949 lakh ($57k) and made \u20b970 crore ($8M). 155 times the initial investment! Uff.\n\nSEBI also discovered that MMM\u00a0*was*\u00a0Bharat Global. His name was on one of the company\u2019s bank accounts! If you\u2019re running a pump-and-dump, maybe don\u2019t put your name on the bank account of the company you\u2019re pumping.\n\nBoring Money is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\n# And then there was Reliance\n\nOf the four fake disclosures I highlighted, one is not the same as the others. When SEBI wrote to Reliance to figure out if they had indeed placed a \u20b9120 crore order with Bharat Global, here\u2019s what it got:\n\n>RIL submitted vide e-mail dated December 19, 2024 that BGDL had not supplied any material for the FCC project of RIL\u2019s refinery. RIL further submitted that BGDL (formerly known as Kkrrafton Developers Limited) had supplied only general construction materials to RIL for about INR 155 crore (including taxes) during the period from April 01, 2024 to September 30, 2024 which was not related to the FCC project.\n\nBharat Global\u2019s announcement about a \u20b9120 crore order was false, no surprises there, but Reliance told SEBI that there was\u00a0*another*\u00a0\u20b9155 crore order which was apparently legitimate and fulfilled?!\n\nBizarre. Very bizarre. Bharat Global was a company whose revenue was literally 0 for many years before it turned into a money grabbing vehicle. It lied about having subsidiaries which did not exist. The company changed its name 4 times in its lifetime. (Probably picked the name \u201cBharat Global\u201d because of how patriotic the pumpers-and-dumpers were.)\n\nThere was no business! There was never a business! All its disclosures were fake. And yet, somehow, out of nowhere, not only did it have a real \u20b9155 crore order from Reliance, but it also\u00a0*chose to*\u00a0make up a fake order when it could very well have just disclosed the real one instead?\n\nI think this takes the cake for anything I\u2019ve written until now. And I\u2019ve written about some\u00a0[weird stuff](https://boringmoney.in/p/embassy-reit-looks-at-a-fraud#:~:text=suspicious%20was%20suspicious.-,FIT%20AND%20PROPER,-If%20you%20were). I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. SEBI needs to jump on this thread and find some answers. But hey, until then, maybe I can guess?\n\nHere\u2019s some stuff about Reliance\u2019s payments from SEBI\u2019s order:\n\n>\u2026 data submitted by RIL shows that a payment of INR 57.22 crore was made to Kkrrafton Developers Limited on March 16, 2024, another 8.07 crore on March 19, 2024 and a last payment of INR 28.04 crore on August 12, 2024.\n\nand,\n\n>\\[\u2026\\] In this regard, from the bank statements of BGDL obtained from Indian Bank, it was observed that RIL made advance payments of Rs. 65.29 crore to BGDL in March 2024.\n\nReliance paid Bharat Global \u20b965 crore in advance and before it even raised an invoice for that money! In all, Reliance paid the company at \u20b993 crore, with the last payment in August. Now come on, Reliance is known to be pretty cut-throat, always getting the better half of a deal. Paying a zero-revenue company \u20b965 crore before it\u2019s even asked to doesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\nLet\u2019s put these events down in chronological order:\n\n1. In March 2024, Reliance paid Bharat Global \u20b965 crore out of the goodness of its heart.\n2. The next month in April, Bharat Global allotted shares worth \u20b997 crore to its favourite people.\n3. In August, Reliance paid another \u20b928 crore.\n4. Later in the same month, Bharat Global allotted another \u20b973 crore worth of shares to its favourite people.\n5. The money that Reliance paid Bharat Global did not show up in Bharat Global\u2019s financial statements.\n\nIs there a connection between the money Reliance paid Bharat Global and the money that Bharat Global\u2019s favourite people paid it? I don\u2019t know. Were those people really using Reliance\u2019s money to run a pump-and-dump? I have absolutely no idea. \\[1\\]\n\n# Playing saviour\n\nThe people that bought Bharat Global\u2019s shares in its second sale in August were to be locked in until February 2025. By late December, just before SEBI stepped in, Bharat Global\u2019s pumped-up price was at \u20b91300\u20146X the price that the August buyers got the shares at.\n\nThis post would\u2019ve probably been a two-part pump-and-dump series, had SEBI not identified the first pump-and-dump in time. For now, the 13 folks that made the \u20b9272 crore profit will have to give the money back. And the others that couldn\u2019t sell Bharat Global\u2019s shares in time will be stuck holding the bag.\u00a0\\[2\\]\n\n\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I really mean this! There are a lot of unknowns.\n\n\\[2\\] In the process of writing this I discovered that some of the 41 people are very obviously involved in other pump-and-dumps as well. Attempts at them, at least, if not successful ones. I\u2019ll probably write about it in a future MYSTERY POST.\n\n  \nOriginal Source: [https://boringmoney.in/p/reliance-pays-a-hell-ton-of-money](https://boringmoney.in/p/reliance-pays-a-hell-ton-of-money?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=bharat+global+reliance)",

Generate infinite shares, sell for infinite money.\n\nIf a company sells a billion shares, it\u2019s just splitting the same limited pie into a billion pieces. The total size of the pie remains the same. So of course there isn\u2019t going to be any infinite money.\n\nBut because of this infinite shares creation ability, companies can shrink the size of the piece of the pie with any particular shareholder. If I own 10 shares of a company with 100 shares, and the company magically creates another 900 shares and sells them to its favourite people, those people now have 900 while I\u2019m stuck with the same 10.\n\nThere are safeguards against this kind of stuff and it\u2019s not something that usually happens. I probably wouldn\u2019t be writing about it if it did usually happen. Late in December, SEBI\u00a0[issued an order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/dec-2024/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-bharat-global-developers-limited_90114.html)\u00a0against Bharat Global Developers, a 30-year old company whose only reason for existence was its capacity to defraud individual investors.\n\nBharat Global ran a classic pump-and-dump, and the first thing you do to run a pump-and-dump is hoard up on the shares of the company you\u2019re pumping. From SEBI\u2019s order:\n\n>\\[\u2026\\] the Company made two preferential allotment of shares \u2013 9.72 crore shares in April 2024 to 31 allottees and 35 lakh shares in August 2024 to 10 allottees. These large preferential allotments resulted in 99.5% of the shareholding being concentrated in the hands of these 41 allottees\u2026\n\nBharat Global sold more than 10 crore (100 million) shares to 41 of its favourite people. These 10 crore shares were the entire company! 99.5% of it at least. 99.5% is quite a sweet spot if you\u2019re looking to do a pump-and-dump.\n\n# The pump and the dump\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken about the general mechanics of a pump-and-dump\u00a0[before](https://boringmoney.in/p/youtube-is-great-for-pump-and-dumps#:~:text=The%20mechanics%20of%20it%20are%20known%20and%20simple%3A). It\u2019s reasonably straightforward:\n\n1. Find a relatively unknown company. Buy as many of its shares as you can.\n2. Scream your lungs out! The nicer the story about the company, the better.\n3. People thinking they\u2019re great stock pickers will buy the shares of the company. This is a dumb illiquid stock, so its price will shoot up.\n4. Sell to the suckers.\n5. ??? Profit.\n\nBharat Global sold the bulk of its shares in April 2024, first starting with 31 people. This was a \u20b997 crore sale. In August 2024, it sold another batch of shares to 10 more people for \u20b973 crore.\n\nWhen a company sells its shares in a \u201cpreferential allotment\u201d or in better words, to people that it chooses to, those people cannot sell their shares to the public right away. They\u2019re locked in for 6 months to ensure that the company isn\u2019t just distributing free money, and so that public investors have some time to evaluate and react to the company\u2019s actions.\n\nThe 31 people who bought Bharat Global\u2019s shares in April couldn\u2019t sell until at least October. As soon as October hit, the company started screaming its lungs out with announcements. Here\u2019s a slice of the kind of disclosures it made:\n\n1. \u20b9300 crore order! For potatoes! From McCain India Agro Pvt Ltd. Yeah, the frozen fries company.\n2. \u20b9650 crore order! From Tata Agro & Consumer Products. For tea leaves and dry fruits.\n3. \u20b9156 crore order! From UPL Agro\u2014groundnuts to extract oil from!\n4. A \u20b9120 crore order from Reliance Industries Ltd! For designing, engineering and constructing a refinery component.\n\nI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to say it, but all these orders were fake. SEBI went to each company and asked them about the orders. The companies from the disclosures don\u2019t even exist! Bharat Global just added a random \u201cAgro\u201d at the end of a bunch of popular companies\u2019 names to make their fake orders sound fancy.\n\nBetween 30th October and 11th December, 13 of Bharat Global\u2019s favourite 41 who were now out of the lock in, sold their shares. They made a massive \u20b9272 crore ($31 million) in profit. Here\u2019s an example of the scale of the profit:\n\n>One of the preferential allottees, namely Mahadev Manubhai Makvana who was allotted 37,82,000 shares in the first allotment, is also the Authorised Signatory in respect of two bank accounts of BGDL with Yes Bank and Axis Bank. The account opening date for Yes Bank was March 20, 2024. He offloaded 4,97,359 BGDL shares for INR 70,71,94,153 between November 01, 2024 and December 20, 2024, making a profit of approximately INR 70,22,20,563 against an investment of approximately INR 49,73,590.\n\nMahadev Manubhai Makvana (MMM?) invested \u20b949 lakh ($57k) and made \u20b970 crore ($8M). 155 times the initial investment! Uff.\n\nSEBI also discovered that MMM\u00a0*was*\u00a0Bharat Global. His name was on one of the company\u2019s bank accounts! If you\u2019re running a pump-and-dump, maybe don\u2019t put your name on the bank account of the company you\u2019re pumping.\n\nBoring Money is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\n# And then there was Reliance\n\nOf the four fake disclosures I highlighted, one is not the same as the others. When SEBI wrote to Reliance to figure out if they had indeed placed a \u20b9120 crore order with Bharat Global, here\u2019s what it got:\n\n>RIL submitted vide e-mail dated December 19, 2024 that BGDL had not supplied any material for the FCC project of RIL\u2019s refinery. RIL further submitted that BGDL (formerly known as Kkrrafton Developers Limited) had supplied only general construction materials to RIL for about INR 155 crore (including taxes) during the period from April 01, 2024 to September 30, 2024 which was not related to the FCC project.\n\nBharat Global\u2019s announcement about a \u20b9120 crore order was false, no surprises there, but Reliance told SEBI that there was\u00a0*another*\u00a0\u20b9155 crore order which was apparently legitimate and fulfilled?!\n\nBizarre. Very bizarre. Bharat Global was a company whose revenue was literally 0 for many years before it turned into a money grabbing vehicle. It lied about having subsidiaries which did not exist. The company changed its name 4 times in its lifetime. (Probably picked the name \u201cBharat Global\u201d because of how patriotic the pumpers-and-dumpers were.)\n\nThere was no business! There was never a business! All its disclosures were fake. And yet, somehow, out of nowhere, not only did it have a real \u20b9155 crore order from Reliance, but it also\u00a0*chose to*\u00a0make up a fake order when it could very well have just disclosed the real one instead?\n\nI think this takes the cake for anything I\u2019ve written until now. And I\u2019ve written about some\u00a0[weird stuff](https://boringmoney.in/p/embassy-reit-looks-at-a-fraud#:~:text=suspicious%20was%20suspicious.-,FIT%20AND%20PROPER,-If%20you%20were). I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. SEBI needs to jump on this thread and find some answers. But hey, until then, maybe I can guess?\n\nHere\u2019s some stuff about Reliance\u2019s payments from SEBI\u2019s order:\n\n>\u2026 data submitted by RIL shows that a payment of INR 57.22 crore was made to Kkrrafton Developers Limited on March 16, 2024, another 8.07 crore on March 19, 2024 and a last payment of INR 28.04 crore on August 12, 2024.\n\nand,\n\n>\\[\u2026\\] In this regard, from the bank statements of BGDL obtained from Indian Bank, it was observed that RIL made advance payments of Rs. 65.29 crore to BGDL in March 2024.\n\nReliance paid Bharat Global \u20b965 crore in advance and before it even raised an invoice for that money! In all, Reliance paid the company at \u20b993 crore, with the last payment in August. Now come on, Reliance is known to be pretty cut-throat, always getting the better half of a deal. Paying a zero-revenue company \u20b965 crore before it\u2019s even asked to doesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\nLet\u2019s put these events down in chronological order:\n\n1. In March 2024, Reliance paid Bharat Global \u20b965 crore out of the goodness of its heart.\n2. The next month in April, Bharat Global allotted shares worth \u20b997 crore to its favourite people.\n3. In August, Reliance paid another \u20b928 crore.\n4. Later in the same month, Bharat Global allotted another \u20b973 crore worth of shares to its favourite people.\n5. The money that Reliance paid Bharat Global did not show up in Bharat Global\u2019s financial statements.\n\nIs there a connection between the money Reliance paid Bharat Global and the money that Bharat Global\u2019s favourite people paid it? I don\u2019t know. Were those people really using Reliance\u2019s money to run a pump-and-dump? I have absolutely no idea. \\[1\\]\n\n# Playing saviour\n\nThe people that bought Bharat Global\u2019s shares in its second sale in August were to be locked in until February 2025. By late December, just before SEBI stepped in, Bharat Global\u2019s pumped-up price was at \u20b91300\u20146X the price that the August buyers got the shares at.\n\nThis post would\u2019ve probably been a two-part pump-and-dump series, had SEBI not identified the first pump-and-dump in time. For now, the 13 folks that made the \u20b9272 crore profit will have to give the money back. And the others that couldn\u2019t sell Bharat Global\u2019s shares in time will be stuck holding the bag.\u00a0\\[2\\]\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I really mean this! There are a lot of unknowns.\n\n\\[2\\] In the process of writing this I discovered that some of the 41 people are very obviously involved in other pump-and-dumps as well. Attempts at them, at least, if not successful ones. I\u2019ll probably write about it in a future MYSTERY POST.\n\nOriginal Source: [https://boringmoney.in/p/reliance-pays-a-hell-ton-of-money](https://boringmoney.in/p/reliance-pays-a-hell-ton-of-money?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=bharat+global+reliance)",
