HDFC Bank: Biggest private sector bank with a focus on retail and growing in Tier-2/3 cities. We are 1 stock market crash away from HDFC Bank rallying. Irony?\n2. Angel One: Growing the second fastest in brokers. Fairly valued as compared to Groww but overvalued as compare to Zerodha. Reference Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gb1r0m/want\\_to\\_go\\_yolo\\_on\\_angel\\_one/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gb1r0m/want_to_go_yolo_on_angel_one/)\n3. INFY/HCL/Wipro: Most of my positions are more than 2 years old. Now, you can call it Betting on Trump\n4. IRFC: Got lucky. Bought at a decent valuation when the stock was 25. Sold 1/3 position at 125 and still hold the remaining 2/3 of the position. Will let it play out because if India needs to move at scale, railways need to be better and more common. Railways get their funding from IRFC.\n5. Amara Raja: Betting on a reputed battery company with the most reliable battery brand (Amron). Bought it at decent valuations around 2 years back\n6. Divis/Dr. Reddy/NH/Lal Pathlabs: Consumer companies in an economy where focus on healthcare is expected to grow\n\nIf you want my reasons for any other stock, just comment. \n\nIn which stocks do you think I can increase my position? For which stocks you think the reward outweigh the risk? Share your thoughts in the comments below. We can discuss and can make/save money together $$",

        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone, I currently have a self made folio of about 23L (entered market in Mar 21) with a 50% Large,30% mid & 20% small allocation and 80% value from 18 stocks. I am 41 and doent have any liabilities, house is paid for, not interested in owning a car right now (If I will, I'll buy with cash) to add to this I have a year of expenses saved asside as emergency funds plus a PPF account which matures next year.\n\nI am also fortunate to inherit my parents folio which is currently at 1.8c with 82% of it coming from 12 stocks and it has a total of 65 stocks which were bought almost a decade back and has not been managed since. It just compounded over time. Note: Dad retired from L&T thus 33% which I need to trim. This along with my folio is for my retirement and plan to keep it long term 15+ yrs\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mg3jz8r3uidd1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=cca951302023d0a072154bc82731ce0a95ec7e05\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4gh57p4uidd1.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3a284b216e5846392ef584cb3f1c334cb441ead\n\nNow I am considering if I should go with a PMS (some options are Liquide black/Kedia securities. I am also checking for one of my aqquitances who manages PMS and is a ex Axis bank employee used to manage HNIs\n\nTalk about Liquide they charge currently have a flat structure of 30k annually and provides a 360 approach to investing including tax planning. They will have around 10 custom stocks and plan to deploy funds over 2 weeks in the market. I was a bit concerned about it but they said they are taking money from equity and reinvesting into other stocks so not really a risk persay. Also folio will be managed by me 100% they just act as advisory.\n\nOver the years I feel it is better to have specialists working (like a team of yours) that makes life easier. I'll be happy if I can get a 17%-18% CAGR and peaceful sleep\n\nYour thoughts please.. I'm sharing snapshot of my folio (from Zerodha) and parents folio (excel) so you have a fair idea on how I have performed (everyone has performed in the bull market \ud83d\ude01)\n\nYour recommendations are really appreciated, Thank You :)",

Understand the market, pick undervalued, growing, quality stocks, invest and forget. Your stock picking skills are good IMO. Just hold for long. No advisory will come in help if COVID or 2008 crash repeats, you are most likely to sell those in panic and due to lack of understanding the business. \u263a\ufe0f I'm not much qualified to advice, still I have heard these from my father. He was approached by a PMS manager, but luckily he got away from it. Now he holds many 10-20-30-40+ baggers. I'm more focused towards studying and picking growing smallcaps in value zone. Anyways PMS won't help in any market. Check historic returns of popular PMFs. Compare it with an index fund. You will yourself beat them if you have conviction on business and hold.

Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Professional Expertise**: PMS ensures active monitoring and management by experts with a dedicated research team.\n2. **Better Returns**: With the right firm, you can expect consistent returns, often exceeding 15% CAGR over the long term (5+ years).\n3. **Peace of Mind**: Delegating your portfolio management reduces stress and lets you focus on other priorities.\n\n**My Recommendations**:  \nAvoid smaller players like Liquide. Instead, consider reputed firms like **360One** and **Alchemy Capital**. Both have a proven track record and are trusted by many HNIs, including several of my own clients who are extremely happy with the performance and stability of their PMS investments.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you\u2019d like more insights or need guidance regarding PMS options!",

I already have a significant stake in Indian stock markets, but I'm concerned about the high taxes on NRIs and the transaction/currency conversion costs involved in sending money to India.\n\nMy biggest worry is the tax implications of repatriating funds back to the US in 5-10 years. I've been unable to find a comprehensive guide online, so I'm hoping to learn from your experiences.\n\n**What strategies have worked well for you? What pitfalls should I avoid?**\n\nThanks for your insights!",

And low risk bonds are highly unlikely to default on their debts. So selling CDS for them could actually mean that the mutual fund pockets some extra income in the form of premiums.  \n\\[[source](https://finshots.in/archive/sebi-rbi-credit-default-swap-cds-mutual-funds/)\\]\n\nNow, CDO's in India are nothing new ([first one came out in 2002](https://www.icicibank.com/about-us/article/news-icici-launches-indias-first-cdo-fund-20131812145138312#:~:text=today%20announced%20the%20launch%20of,mutual%20fund%20registered%20with%20SEBI)). But I wonder SEBI allowing MF's to sell CDO backed CDS's encourage the supply of risky bonds in the Indian market.\n\nSince someone has to rate these swaps, a few bad apples combined with faulty regulation/corruption from SEBI's side could cause people to lose trust in these wonderful financial instrument.",

Recently, friends advised that having too many MF SIPs can be problematic. They mentioned that the investment amount shouldn't change, but the number of MFs should be fewer. I didn't fully understand this. Are they right? If so, why? Also, if I need to reduce the number of MFs, which SIPs should I keep and which should I let go?\n\n2. **Should I invest less in SIPs and more in stocks?**\n\nI'm 29, and my friends say my risk appetite is higher. However, I prefer long-term investments and don't have the time or expertise to buy/sell stocks regularly. Am I making a mistake by focusing more on SIPs? Should I allocate more to stocks?\n\n3. **Should I consider an SWP?**\n\n4. I have 10 lacs to invest now. Any suggestions on how to allocate this based on my current portfolio?\n\nSorry for the many questions, but I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!",

I don't think multiple ELSS Tax Saver funds are required. Just keep 1 from each category. The reason for not keeping multiple MF's is, different expense ratios can keep eating into your profits.\n2. If you don't have time to analyse and buy/sell stocks, you can continue with your SIP, no problem in that. You mentioned that you are picking stocks based on your friend's suggestions, and that can go horribly wrong.

        "title": "Possible Scam Involving ICICI Bank \u2013 Need Advice & Help with Escalation",
        "selftext": "On 2nd March, I got a call from an unknown number. The guy claimed he accidentally deposited \u20b920,000 into my ICICI bank account via a cash deposit machine (CDM) and wanted it back. I\u2019ve heard about those \u201cmoney in your account\u201d scams before, so I laughed it off and disconnected.\n\nOut of curiosity, I checked my bank statement later that day. This account is mainly for rent and small income inflows, so it\u2019s busy. Sure enough, there was an inflow that day. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was from this guy or from one of my regular sources.\n\nSince everyone has their own struggles, I called him back and told him that if it was genuinely his money, I\u2019d return it. But then came the red flags.\n\n**Red Flags:**\n\n1. **Timing doesn\u2019t add up:**  \n   He said he deposited the money on *22nd February*, but he only realized it on *2nd March*. That\u2019s over a week of no follow-up for a \u20b920K cash deposit. His excuse? He just \u201cdidn\u2019t know.\u201d If anyone deposits that kind of money and it doesn\u2019t show up, wouldn\u2019t they panic instantly?\n\n2. **CDM safeguards ignored:**  \n   He claimed to have used a CDM without a debit card. But CDMs ask you to enter the account number *twice*, show the account holder\u2019s name, and ask you to confirm it before proceeding. These are built-in checks to prevent exactly this kind of \u201caccident.\u201d He apparently just blew past all of them.\n\n3. **No receipt:**  \n   CDMs issue a receipt with the recipient\u2019s name, partial account number, and the amount. He has no receipt. None. That\u2019s suspicious.\n\n4. **Breach of privacy?**  \n   He says that after he \u201ccomplained\u201d to ICICI, a bank employee handed over **my phone number, account number, and branch details** to him. ICICI is one of the biggest private banks in India. Is it normal for their staff to give out customer details like this?\n\n5. **Bank official calls me:**  \n   On *7th March*, a bank staff member called me and asked *when I\u2019ll be depositing the \u20b920K* into that guy\u2019s account. I pushed back and said I can\u2019t do that\u2014it doesn\u2019t sound like a standard process. She then said she\u2019ll forward the complaint to my home branch. Since when does a bank ask you to hand over money via CDM without verifying if the claim is even legitimate?\n\n6. **Weird email trail:**  \n   I visited my home branch recently, and they showed me a few emails regarding this. All of them say something like:  \n   \"*X amount was deposited on X date. Y person says it was done by mistake. Kindly verify and, if it was indeed an error, please return it.*\"  \n   So basically, *they put the onus entirely on me to verify the claim*, while verbally sounding 100% sure that it\u2019s a mistake. That contradiction feels off.\n\nOn advice from some helpful folks on LegalAdviceIndia, I\u2019ve already moved my funds (excluding the disputed \u20b920K) to another bank account just to be safe.\n\nI genuinely feel like this is some kind of scam. Too many things don\u2019t add up. I might be wrong\u2014but this whole thing smells fishy.\n\n**What should I reply to ICICI?**  \nAlso, if anyone knows a direct **grievance redressal email** (not the generic customercare@icicibank.com), please share it. I want to escalate this.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n(rewritten using gpt to make it more readable)",

At first, I thought it was a scam and just disconnected the call without listening much. But a little later, I actually received an SMS confirming the deposit. I double-checked through net banking, SMS, transaction history, and even bank\u2019s customer care to make sure the money had really come in. Once I was fully sure, I spoke to him. He kept requesting that I transfer the money back directly to his account as it was EID in a few days, and he needed the money for the festival, but I found it suspicious and refused.\n\nI told him clearly that since it was his mistake, he should go to his bank and raise a complaint to reverse the transaction properly. Despite that, he kept calling and insisting I transfer the money manually. I wasn\u2019t convinced. Instead, I raised a complaint with my bank (HDFC) and explained everything \u2014 that I had received someone else's money by mistake, I didn\u2019t intend to keep it, and I gave permission for the bank to reverse it. But I would not manually send money to anyone\u2019s account.\n\nThere was a lot of back and forth between me, the bank, and the technician. Eventually, the bank was able to reverse the amount on their own. I never transferred anything manually from my side.",

If someone has approached you that they by mistake deposited money in your account and it's not your money then most likely they are correct. You can transfer the money to that guy - take a signed undertaking from that guy that he accidentally transferred some money to you and you are simply transferring it back along with a copy of his I'd proof and bank passbook copy (This is to protect you in case in future the guy turns to be a drug peddler and police asks you why did you transferred money to him). \n\nBank will not debit any money from your account to anyone's account without your specific authorisation - as in that case you can raise a complaint that the bank transferred money from your account without your permission then the bank is in soup. Even they should not have shared your personal details, that is something not allowed - they could have chosen to mediate in good faith and with your permission only shared your details with the person.",

And for stock investing, icici is ok just buy the prime plan (Which are for lifetime) and the ivalue (this will reduce your amc to 300/year, gst to be paid over this amount or not, I don't really remember).

        "selftext": "Finally made my first 5 digit profit, been trading small quantities for over 1.5 years alongside my freelancing job\n\nNot a new trader, been trading for over 2 years now but was trading with 50k-1L capital and used to withdraw my profits from time to time. Always traded options for swings(max total value never more than 8-10k) and max 2 good swing setups a week. Everything else intraday, risk no more than 700-800 rs per trade and target 1:2/1:3. Intraday I mostly trade as per the trending sectors, and then selecting the stocks which have moved less compared to the other stocks and enter those.\n\nCapital used for today\u2019s trades is approx 1.2L, was planning not to deploy more than 1L but market was trending so deployed slightly more.\n\nHave been reading a lot of posts here everyday which describe how it\u2019s almost impossible to make money trading. Just want to let everybody know, that it\u2019s not impossible, but the learning curve is VERY steep. And by the time most people reach the end of this curve, they\u2019ve blown up multiple accounts, and also end up destroying the other MOST important thing, which is their mindset.\n\nSo please remember, always start small. Take more swings and wait patiently for your setups to form. Risk very little in intraday as market doesn\u2019t trend everyday, atleast not all the sectors. Some will trend daily but you need to get the flow right, which again takes a lot of time. Risking and making less intraday is crucial, which lets you ride your swings fully. 5-6 days like today and I can make a 6 figure income, which I\u2019d say at my level is extremely good\n\nAnd also, having a source of income alongside trading gives you a peace of mind. Not forcing you to take the substandard setups/trades. \n\nIf you be disciplined, less greedy and fully focused on what you do, the money eventually comes. Stop focusing on daily/weekly results and be fully in sync with the process. There is indeed light at the end of this tunnel, provided you don\u2019t stray from the correct path :) ",

Basis experience so far in the markets, can't find value anywhere currently. Holding 2.5L in cash for any correction.\n\nRight move at this point seems to diversify away from equities. However, overall debt portfolio also is sizeable and it doesn't seem wise to add to it considering taxes and inflation. Hence have zeroed down on land or real estate as the next investment vehicle. However, ticket size is huge, which is why I feel I am caught in a long waiting game.\n\nMedium term strategy for equities is to keep building the cash position waiting for prices to cool down (US elections, interest rate move maybe) and to build a safety shell around equity portfolio so that it needn't be touched and can keep growing at whatever rate.\n\nThoughts? Anyone else thinking similarly?",

        "title": "Strengthening the Indian Rupee: Leveraging Idle Gold through Enhanced Banking Schemes",
        "selftext": "India's cultural affinity for gold has led to an estimated 25,000 tonnes of the precious metal being held by households and temples, often lying idle in lockers and vaults.\n\n[tianjindaxuexuebao.com](https://tianjindaxuexuebao.com/dashboard/uploads/8.%204V2ZJ.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)This vast reserve, if effectively mobilized, presents a significant opportunity to bolster our economy and strengthen the Indian Rupee (INR).\n\n\n\n**The Economic Impact of Idle Gold:**\n\n* **Current Account Deficit (CAD):** India is one of the world's largest importers of gold. This high volume of imports contributes substantially to the CAD, exerting pressure on the INR.[tianjindaxuexuebao.com](https://tianjindaxuexuebao.com/dashboard/uploads/8.%204V2ZJ.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Currency Depreciation:** A higher CAD often leads to the depreciation of the INR against major currencies, affecting the country's purchasing power and economic stability.[policybazaar.com](https://www.policybazaar.com/gold-rate/articles/how-gold-affects-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Proposed Solution: Gold Monetization and Specialized Loan Schemes**\n\nTo mitigate these challenges, we should encourage the infusion of idle gold into the economy. The government and financial institutions can play a pivotal role by:\n\n1. **Enhancing Gold Monetization Schemes (GMS):** The GMS, introduced in 2015, aims to mobilize idle gold by allowing individuals and institutions to deposit gold with banks in exchange for interest earnings. However, its uptake has been limited due to various factors, including lack of awareness and concerns about the safety and returns.[tianjindaxuexuebao.com](https://tianjindaxuexuebao.com/dashboard/uploads/8.%204V2ZJ.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n2. **Introducing Specialized Gold-Backed Loan Products:** Banks can develop loan products that offer favorable terms to individuals and businesses willing to pledge their gold holdings. This approach can:\n   * **Provide Liquidity:** Enable gold holders to access funds without selling their assets.\n   * **Reduce Gold Imports:** Satisfy domestic demand through recycled gold, thereby decreasing the need for imports.\n   * **Strengthen the INR:** Lower gold imports can help reduce the CAD, contributing to a stronger INR.\n\n**Current Banking Initiatives:**\n\nSeveral banks have initiated gold loan schemes to provide liquidity against gold assets. For instance:\n\n* **ICICI Bank:** Offers gold loans with interest rates starting from 9.25%, allowing loans up to \u20b92 crore with flexible repayment options.[icicibank.com](https://www.icicibank.com/personal-banking/loans/gold-loan?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **State Bank of India (SBI):** Provides personal gold loans with interest rates starting from 8.50% per annum, catering to various financial needs.[sbi.co.in](https://www.sbi.co.in/web/personal-banking/loans/gold-loan?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **HDFC Bank:** Offers quick disbursal of gold loans with competitive interest rates and flexible tenure options.[hdfcbank.com](https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/borrow/loan-against-assets/gold-loan?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy effectively mobilizing idle gold through enhanced monetization schemes and specialized loan products, we can reduce our dependence on gold imports, lower the CAD, and work towards strengthening the INR. It's imperative for policymakers, financial institutions, and citizens to collaborate in this endeavor to harness the economic potential of our gold reserves.\n\n*Note: The information provided is based on available data and aims to present a perspective on leveraging gold assets to strengthen the Indian economy.*",
