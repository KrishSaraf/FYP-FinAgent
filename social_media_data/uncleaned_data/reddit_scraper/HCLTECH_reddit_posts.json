While the stock has fared average for a non-aggressive investor, the news on operations of the company are questionable. \n\nThe organization has stopped promotions and yearly pay rises for 90% of employees for the last 2 years. Inner me says they are sabotaging employee relationship for a better balance sheet - which reflects in better stock performance.\n\nBut on a long term, when similar IT peers aren't engaging in such practices, the company is sure to face significant emploee led attrition, which would result in loss of projects - which would reflect in the stocks. \n\nI have significant investments in IT stocks, I rebalanced the ones from HCLTECH to other IT majors. I feel this stock is a ticking time bomb, only time will tell if it's as serious as Satyam group.",

Still would call myself that but have taken positions in some not-large-cap companies in the last 1 year.\n\nI have 75 stocks in my portfolio but have include 42 in the screenshot below with a sizeable position > 75k\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xgaatvhmth1e1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=35045a22f776a0cac3c1bff5137565b6fdd7a356\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w87tamhmth1e1.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=17c5aa1587c2ade76f226afcd3bc5a8d91a48fe3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yhfpmuhmth1e1.png?width=983&format=png&auto=webp&s=71ccc8081f09364fe7362f17b51a9b6ea559fbb9\n\nRationale for the top holdings\n\n1. HDFC Bank: Biggest private sector bank with a focus on retail and growing in Tier-2/3 cities. We are 1 stock market crash away from HDFC Bank rallying. Irony?\n2. Angel One: Growing the second fastest in brokers. Fairly valued as compared to Groww but overvalued as compare to Zerodha. Reference Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gb1r0m/want\\_to\\_go\\_yolo\\_on\\_angel\\_one/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gb1r0m/want_to_go_yolo_on_angel_one/)\n3. INFY/HCL/Wipro: Most of my positions are more than 2 years old. Now, you can call it Betting on Trump\n4. IRFC: Got lucky. Bought at a decent valuation when the stock was 25. Sold 1/3 position at 125 and still hold the remaining 2/3 of the position. Will let it play out because if India needs to move at scale, railways need to be better and more common. Railways get their funding from IRFC.\n5. Amara Raja: Betting on a reputed battery company with the most reliable battery brand (Amron). Bought it at decent valuations around 2 years back\n6. Divis/Dr. Reddy/NH/Lal Pathlabs: Consumer companies in an economy where focus on healthcare is expected to grow\n\nIf you want my reasons for any other stock, just comment. \n\nIn which stocks do you think I can increase my position? For which stocks you think the reward outweigh the risk? Share your thoughts in the comments below. We can discuss and can make/save money together $$",

Most of the post on socials are people suggesting buy the dip , stocks are at a discount/sale, best time to buy etc. They are not, the price of the stock is what it currently is . No more and no less. \n\nTill there is no clear signs of trend reversal in Nifty, hold on to your cash. Each and every bounce is a good opportunity to reduce exposure. While waiting for the reversal you can make a list of stocks which are relatively strong compared to Nifty (i'll share few egs) .\n\n  \nNifty - Is at an important support level. Breach of this level can easily trigger a 500-800 points down move. In my opinion Nifty might bounce in the coming week . Don't enter fresh longs on the bounce. \n\n[Nifty Index - 1HR TF ](https://preview.redd.it/ak2p25juy8xd1.png?width=2475&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fe6061f9e659c3d6535255feed029cb999cf10b)\n\n  \nSharing a few stocks which have relative strength compared to Nifty. \n\n[NIFTY - D1 \\/ HCLTECH - D1](https://preview.redd.it/pjfzouee09xd1.png?width=2478&format=png&auto=webp&s=6159ba025a4d182f322f1ee2ba8c35190f10e77b)\n\n[NIFTY - D1 \\/ TORNTPHARM - D1](https://preview.redd.it/wmrmvibh09xd1.png?width=2478&format=png&auto=webp&s=63be626ae100e57190b6beabecffb2a61a0db742)\n\n[NIFTY - D1 \\/ INDHOTEL - D1 ](https://preview.redd.it/vveuz0ul09xd1.png?width=2478&format=png&auto=webp&s=79471f16b0d804a8f40488bbe9365235a749f68a)\n\n",

                "body": "Hi man, good you have invested and made returns too. Here are some suggestions from my side, don't be disheartened or offended. I am giving these in your best interest only and since I've gone through this phase i can probably give more sensible advice  \n1- Ncc- it's a okay share. ROE on lower side, but main thing is what theme are you betting on. You mentioned you are bullish on infra. From past experiences it is seen that during bull markets infra, real estate shares make highs and do well but during bear markets everyone forget such shares. This theme has never fascinated my personally, and I do not fall for this theory that \"India ko develop hona hai toh infra toh badhega hi\" that is a hollow statement and many imp stats are ignored while saying this. Still if you have studied the theme enough and bullish on it then keep up with it. Other financial ratios seem to be fine in this share.   \n2- HCLTech - Large cap IT. In IT space I can divide it like two categories. Extremely large cap big companies and some emerging small cap or mid cap IT space. Personally if I am coming to markets i want to make more than usual returns. Large cap ITs have grown significantly and I do not see them growing 16-18 percent, although i would want more than 20% growth returns. So I always look for mid cap ITs not even small cap because that makes it more risky. So general suggestion, until unless you are too hinged on hcltech you can look for mid cap, see where their operations are what are their services? do this before rate cuts starts because that will give boost to the company's financials in the coming quarters. \n\n3- Tata steel - You might not like my opinion but reaching 400 in five years is not a big achievement (& is not even guaranteed). Thing is it is highly cyclical stock. Even tata steel mgmt doesn't know what steel prices they would be addressing in next quarter because a lot of volatility is there in such sectors due to geopolitical reasons and much more. Tata mgmt is amazing but business essentially is not good and once the downtrend starts then you will be stuck at one price for long and even the mgmt can't do much if external forces are not in their favor. So in long run you are minimizing your returns if you keep ur money in this stock. All my answers are in assumption of you should be making at least 18-20% returns every year (not just one year)\n\n4-Ambuja Cement- why are you so hinged on infra and building materials? If you see you are keeping such low ROE businesses that automatically will reduce your returns. ROE is an important ratio, ideally it should be above 18% and if cash light business is there like IT then above 25%   \n\n\n5- Bought the best banking stock. You got it at right levels so cant say much. Not a bad investment and can make good returns \n\n  \n6-  Sula - Ideally not a good sector to invest, and even if you are then you should keep sectoral leaders. These sectors are not something which will observe huge demands all of sudden, understand this. Buying small cap shares makes sense when the sector is in huge demand. UB was much better choice. And if you asked me I would say you should invest in proper consumption stock rather than this. \n\n7- IRFC - another low ROE business. Seems like you got it by hearing its name in news or x. I mean you can invest but again from long term if you are here to make good returns then focus should be on right sectors, high roe business. \n\n8- Goldbees - I do not invest in bees personally and I have a neutral view on it. \n\nOverall your returns are less not just from one year view but I can see your future pf trajectory. I know you are not open to make changes but you should make changes at this level to improve your pf for the future.\n\nGeneral advice\n\n1- Do not be in love with any share/company. We do have our favourites where we think we are gonna make money, company is good. But we cannot be fixated. We are here to make money and not keep the loving company even if we are losing money. \n\n2- Always be in search for better ideas/themes. I think your pf is more towards low roe business, more infra related and if infra theme fails then this pf will give less returns. Try to think of other themes. I urge you to research on consumption stocks because in long run consumption shares can give 20-25% returns. Technology shares and financial shares can do the same. \n\nI hope I did not offend you but I gave an honest view as if you were my younger brother. Keep growing and learning and happy investing. Im ready to ans further questions if u got any",

        "selftext": "In the current correcting market, I have selected 12 stocks for my Tech Portfolio. I started with a list of 25 electronics and technology-based stocks, which I shortlisted to 15 based on the following factors:\n\n* Low PEG\n* Low P/E\n* Low Market Cap/Sales ratio\n* Good ROE and ROCE\n* Positive profit and sales growth\n\nOut of these 15, I eliminated 3 stocks simply because their peers in the list appeared more lucrative. The allocation for the selected stocks in the portfolio is as follows:\n\n* BEL: 10%\n* IndusTower: 10%\n* ARE&M: 10%\n* TATAELXSI: 10%\n* Vedanta (Vedl): 10%\n* Tanla: 5%\n* HCLTECH: 5%\n* ASTRAMICRO: 5%\n* Mindteck: 5%\n* MICEL: 5%\n* AMIORG: 5%\n* CGPower: 5%\n\n**Buy Strategy for the Next Decade**\n\nOut of the capital I have dedicated to tech investments, I plan to use 85% now and keep 15% as buffer capital to increase allocation in losing stocks 3 months later. Additionally, I will implement quarterly SIPs starting six months from now, contributing 10-25% of the initial capital. The allocation is subject to market conditions at that time.\n\n**Sell Strategy**\n\nIf a stock becomes overvalued suddenly, I will sell one-fourth of my holdings in that stock every time its RSI-30 crosses the 75 mark.\n\n**Downsides of this Portfolio**\n\n* All stocks are trading at a P/E ratio above 10, with an average P/E of 42.3 and a median P/E of 31.5. This is higher than the P/E of Nifty 50 and Nifty Next 50, indicating that wealth could diminish at an amplified rate during economic slowdowns, such as the current one.\n* The portfolio is not hedged with any stable investments.\n\nThis portfolio primarily comprises stocks with multibagger potential and stocks capable of generating consistent growth.\n\nThis is from my personal research based on my personal interests and according to my own risk appetite. Please do your own research before investing a single rupee.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h59clw8ssqde1.jpg?width=1689&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0006daa7154863125f564a4b6e459098274c5dba\n\n",

Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

        "selftext": "In the last 6 months (starting from July 2024) PSU stocks, defence, Railway, Shipping sector have seen massive downtrends and continue to fall. There was too much exuberance in these shares and they hit a high in July (generically). The markets are currently correcting and many other stocks have also corrected a lot.\n\nIT stocks in general (ITBEES, persistent, mphasis, TCS, INFOSYS, HCLTECH) have withstood this current fall and have risen well. Today amidst nifty fall TCS managed to stay up by over 5% due to good earnings. TATAELXSI has seen a massive cut in share prices due to poor earnings as well. Other IT Stocks which have corrected are CYIENT, KPITTECH. But in general the stock prices have increased over 6 months in the above mentioned stocks.\n\nI missed out on selling all my PSU stocks which became multibaggers and I feel they will fall even more. I feel if there\u2019s a reversal at all the IT stocks might correct in the next phase. Hence I feel I should slowly start exiting the IT Stocks which have given me over 50% returns over the last 6 months.\n\nI don\u2019t work in IT, how long can this upmove of IT stocks go on? What\u2019s your opinion?\n\nPS: I have been investing from 2020 and I am a long term investor. Long term investing hasn\u2019t given me great results so far. The first 6 months of 2024 gave me a 30% return in portfolio and currently it is 7.58% today. Long term investing and staying put in PSU stocks isn\u2019t working.",

Although profits grew by 8.4% year-on-year, revenue growth was slower than expected, and the company reduced its full-year growth expectations slightly. Challenges include reduced spending in some areas, but there are positive signs like strong deals and maintained profit margins. The company also announced dividends for shareholders. Experts suggest a cautious approach, as the stock may not rise much in the short term but has long-term potential.  \nTechnically, HCL Technologies' stock is showing signs of a potential decline. If the price falls below \u20b91903, it would confirm a bearish pattern called the rising wedge. A further drop below \u20b91865 would signal a major trend reversal. The weekly RMI (Rohit Momentum Indicator) shows bearish signals with negative divergences, and the daily RMI might turn bearish soon. All these factors indicate a weak short-term outlook.",

I feel it is over diversified and I think I need to balance a bit. I started investing in it through SIP basis over 4 years now. the returns are okay for now, as I am a conservative investor I am heavy into large caps. I also have ITBEES worth 50K rupees in this account which I don't want to sell but add more when there is a huge drop in IT index.\n\nI am thinking to have one large cap, two(or 1) midcaps running in this portfolio. Let me know if my below selection makes any sense.\n\nI want to sell Infy and TCS and move those funds to HCLTech as the recent reports suggested that they are focused more on AI compared to the large cap competition and also HCL pays really good dividend. I think I won't go wrong in choosing 1 out of three as all are heavy weights.\n\non the other stocks I want to hold only KPIT and NewGen as again there is more room to grow for these stocks compared to the other two. I don't have a solid reason as all of these stocks are on the same boat more or less have the same ratios as well. I know they did run a lot in the recent bullrun but I think IT is a safe bet if the investment horizon is long term.\n\nI was so furious that I didn't SIP regularly in NEWGEN but I did in other stocks.\n\nP.S. I also had Wipro and TechM which I sold a year back and moved the funds to ITBEES.\n\nPlease help me with your valuable suggestions....roast me if needed.",

Recently, friends advised that having too many MF SIPs can be problematic. They mentioned that the investment amount shouldn't change, but the number of MFs should be fewer. I didn't fully understand this. Are they right? If so, why? Also, if I need to reduce the number of MFs, which SIPs should I keep and which should I let go?\n\n2. **Should I invest less in SIPs and more in stocks?**\n\nI'm 29, and my friends say my risk appetite is higher. However, I prefer long-term investments and don't have the time or expertise to buy/sell stocks regularly. Am I making a mistake by focusing more on SIPs? Should I allocate more to stocks?\n\n3. **Should I consider an SWP?**\n\n4. I have 10 lacs to invest now. Any suggestions on how to allocate this based on my current portfolio?\n\nSorry for the many questions, but I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!",

I don't think multiple ELSS Tax Saver funds are required. Just keep 1 from each category. The reason for not keeping multiple MF's is, different expense ratios can keep eating into your profits.\n2. If you don't have time to analyse and buy/sell stocks, you can continue with your SIP, no problem in that. You mentioned that you are picking stocks based on your friend's suggestions, and that can go horribly wrong. It's your life and your financial goals, so you can take the call about which way you want to go. Nothing wrong with either.",

However, Infosys (INFY) appears to be losing momentum, which may delay its transition to the leading quadrant.\n\n**Weakening Quadrant:** Coforge is in the weakening quadrant, but its rising relative momentum could propel it into the leading quadrant. Similarly, Persistent Systems has been gaining relative momentum recently. On the other hand, Wipro and TCS are showing signs of losing momentum, although both are still maintaining positions above key benchmarks.\n\n**Lagging Quadrant:** Mphasis, currently in the lagging quadrant, is demonstrating strong momentum and may soon transition to the improving quadrant. Tech Mahindra (Tech M) some uptick in momentum but can underperform the benchmark in the near-term.  HCL Tech is underperforming the benchmark and it losing momentum Within IT basket, HCL Tech remains the weakest stock in terms of momentum and relative strength.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/el1h1wu4gf3e1.jpg?width=1664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=caa793a65e4025dfac99cccc2ac39b62a35bbcd9\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hello all - I\u2019m a professional buysider which means I invest thousands of crores of institutional money for a living. I\u2019ve been doing this for a decade. Separately, of course, I have a personal equity portfolio as well \u2014 in that, I have been investing ~40% of my capital based on momentum factor for the past couple of years and that has beat the broader market indices by a decent margin. \n\nBeginning today, in this thread, I\u2019ll post top 10 stocks from Nifty50 which are currently experiencing high momentum. I\u2019ll update this list on a weekly basis. \n\nIf I see interest in these lists, I\u2019ll post high momentum stocks from small- and mid-caps as well. I have a couple of smallcases as well (freely available) that are also based on momentum tracking. These have given 79% and 20% returns in the past 14 months and 4 months, respectively. \n\nDisclaimer: THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE. I\u2019M NOT A SEBI REGISTERED ENTITY. I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE PERSONAL POSITIONS IN SOME OF THESE STOCKS. THIS IS ALL FOR EDUCATIONAL DISCUSSION ONLY.",

Although profits grew by 8.4% year-on-year, revenue growth was slower than expected, and the company reduced its full-year growth expectations slightly. Challenges include reduced spending in some areas, but there are positive signs like strong deals and maintained profit margins. The company also announced dividends for shareholders. Experts suggest a cautious approach, as the stock may not rise much in the short term but has long-term potential.  \nTechnically, HCL Technologies' stock is showing signs of a potential decline. If the price falls below \u20b91903, it would confirm a bearish pattern called the rising wedge. A further drop below \u20b91865 would signal a major trend reversal. The weekly RMI (Rohit Momentum Indicator) shows bearish signals with negative divergences, and the daily RMI might turn bearish soon. All these factors indicate a weak short-term outlook.",

The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is signaling a buy, and the stock is trading above the 20 EMA and 40 EMA, reflecting bullish momentum. Fresh OI additions at the 12,500 Call strike indicate bullish sentiment. This sets up a 500-point trading range, offering opportunities for breakout and momentum trades. Fresh OI additions at the 12500 call suggests that the call writers are shifting their position to 12500. This development potentially opens up 500 points upside based on the Open Interest data",
