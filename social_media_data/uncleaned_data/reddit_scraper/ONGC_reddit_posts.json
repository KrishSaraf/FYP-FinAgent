Oil fields like KG-98/2 have boosted the production output.\n* The company has become financially stronger with a 5-year profit CAGR of 11%, average ROE at 12.6%, and ROCE 15%. ONGC's profit dipped in FY24 due to lower oil prices. But FY25 has seen a turnaround, with oil output increasing 1% and gas volumes stabilizing courtesy of KG-98/2 and Mumbai High.\n* The company is also aggressively expanding, bidding for 19 blocks under OALP IX and it's also laying the groundwork for the future with ONGC Green, targeting 10 GW of renewable capacity and 1 MTPA of green hydrogen by 2030.\n\nCons:\n\n* As seen earlier, net profit dropped in FY24 due to low oil prices and high depreciation.\n* For upstream giants like ONGC, there's a commodity price risk. For every US$ 5/bbl drop in Brent, there can be an 8-10% decrease in EPS.\n\nThankfully, the company has no other fundamental cons except for risk in commodity prices. \n\nA lot has changed since the last 4 months of my analysis. Where do you think the company and share price will go?",

        "selftext": "\nONGC-NTPC Buys Ayana Renewable for \u20b96,600 Crore*\n\nONGC NTPC Green Pvt. Ltd (ONGPL) is making a massive push into renewable energy by acquiring Ayana Renewable Power for \u20b96,600 crore. This deal is one of the largest in India's green energy sector. Ayana, backed by National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), also has investments from the UK\u2019s British International Investment (BII) and Eversource Capital, which together put $1 billion into the company.\n\nBig Plans for Green Energy Growth\n\nAyana currently has a 4.1 GW portfolio of solar and wind projects in states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat. It plans to expand to 10 GW by 2025. Meanwhile, NTPC already has 14.69 GW of renewable energy capacity and aims to reach 60 GW by 2032. This acquisition is a key milestone for ONGPL, accelerating its journey toward clean energy.\n\nWhy This Deal Matters?\n\nIndia's renewable energy sector is booming, with a total capacity of 217.62 GW. In 2024 alone, solar energy grew by 24.5 GW, and wind energy by 3.4 GW. With rising power demand, more companies are entering this space. Recent deals include JSW Neo Energy buying O2 Power for $1.47 billion and Actis LLP acquiring Stride Climate Investments for $325 million.\n\nIndia\u2019s Green Energy Future\n\nWith this acquisition, ONGC and NTPC are strengthening their commitment to net-zero emissions by 2038 and 2050, respectively. As the country shifts towards cleaner energy, such big deals will play a crucial role in shaping India\u2019s sustainable future.\n\n",

The firm believes the recent correction in ONGC's shares, which seemed excessive, presents a recovery opportunity.\n\nLet's see what the chart is saying : ONGC has recently corrected by around 36% but has shown significant upward momentum over the past two days. The price is currently positioned at the Fibonacci golden zone, a critical level indicating a possible trend reversal. Moreover, a clear RSI divergence on the daily time frame adds to the bullish sentiment.\n\nThe stock has successfully closed above the 40 EMA and 20 SMA on the daily chart, signaling positive momentum. However, for a decisive move upward, ONGC needs to break through the key resistance level at \u20b9267, coinciding with the 40-week EMA.\n\nThe Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) supports this outlook, with a new buy signal on the weekly time frame and continued buy mode on the daily chart. A close above \u20b9267 could pave the way for a strong upward rally.",

        "selftext": "Hey fellow investors! I'm starting an new challenge to buy 1 stock a day.\n\nThe premise is simple - every day, I'm going to buy 1 stock based on recommendations from the Reddit community. But the amount I invest will depend on how confident I am in the recommendation.\n\nHere's how it will work:\n\n\\- Each day, I'll go through stock recommendations in this post or the series of post in the challenge and do my own research.\n\n\\- Based on that research, I'll decide to buy either:\n\n1. 1 share of the stock\n2. 1,000 rs worth of the stock\n3. 5,000 rs worth of the stock\n4. 10,000 rs worth of the stock\n5. If the stock is above 10k, decision will be based on my discretion.\n\n\\- I'll keep a detailed tracker of every stock I buy - the ticker, people who recommended it, the amount invested, the reasoning behind my investment level, and the stock's performance over time.\n\nThe goal is to see if crowdsourced stock tips from Reddit, combined with my own due diligence, can outperform the market.\n\nSo hit me with your best stock recommendations and let's get investing! Make sure to include a brief explanation of why you think the stock is a good buy. I'll be posting the purchase each day and will be tracking the performance of all the stocks purchased through this challenge.\n\n**Background**:\n\nI have not invested much in Indian stock market and want to get into it. While I have started investing in index funds, I want to get better at stock picking(Haven't done fundamental analysis till date), wanted to see if crowd sourced intelligence is better than big fund managers. More importantly I want to get better at 1. finding good stocks with potential and 2. Doing good due diligence on stocks. I am planning to put up a max of 25l in this challenge in 1 year or about 10k per day.\n\n**Updates**: Thanks everyone for the recommendations, we have 70 recommendations so far, which would cover almost 3 months,  have collated all recommendations into [Recommendations sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b0A-D70QUH6Y1f2ET_MjeSk_iPdG1lPBqkVomums85Q/edit?usp=sharing), please let me know if I have missed anything, will stop scraping this post going forward.\n\n**P.S**: Good that I had already added case for stock above 10k, I am not going to look into elcid investments and MRF.\n\n**P.P.S**: Will update link for day 0 on Monday in this thread.\n\n  \n[Link to day 0 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gubgt7/day_0_buying_1_stock_a_day_based_on_reddit/)",

        "selftext": "Hey,\n\nIf you are following me in my last posts, I have been doing short selling and cleared 8L in gross profits this month alone. However i entered market in September as an equity investor, started with 12L worth of stocks, they  reached 9L, took loss and finally today booked final loss of 90K.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2ac8m4i8mle1.png?width=2574&format=png&auto=webp&s=9baf9a640657e3cb7ee1d9cc63f6a62427b27876\n\nand these are my futures positions as of 10:46 AM today:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlcg6zgw8mle1.jpg?width=1023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4abd4aa2fb2c6ba928b7a3a74c5f9bfa9531f70\n\n  \nPoint being:\n\nPeople who are asking you to hold, think about it. The fall of market from September till now and in order to make some profits (if you invested after September, 2024) you first need to get NIFTY up at September levels to break even and then further up to make some profit.\n\nNow i only hold 1 Gold ETF and the way I see the market, its going to bleed. As a short seller even 1 day of bleed is a day of immense returns.\n\nThere are many new investors sitting on huge loses with confused mind. My POV is, if you need money, take loss, if you can learn shorting then take loss and short however if that is your 'non active' money which you don't care for then let it be there however I don't think should listen to people who use the word 'average it', average of - is the -.\n\nAnother point of making this post is, to keep my action today on records permanently so 1 year from now I can look back and conclude on this decision.\n\nMoney freed from above stock sales is reinvested as 'shorting' in VOLTAS MAR FUT and HERO MOTOCOP MAR FUT (up by 4k at this moment)\n\nThanks for reading.

Try buying Meta at $80 dollars when it has fallen from multiple hundreds or buying Manappuram at 80 Rupees when it crashed from 220. Or even itc at 200. That's actual value. Most stocks (around 80%)today in Indian stock exchanges are either overvalued or above medium fair value range. When you buy such stocks, expect 10-20 percent CAGR, provided there is no crash for the next few years. If you had bought actual value, you'll end up making at least 30-40% CAGR.\n\nUndervalued stocks are rare like gold. They are not shared in comments, but mined through hard work and (eventually)sold to people who think overvalued stocks are undervalued. Ill get a lot of hate here but this is the truth.",

For critical minerals NMDC, NALCO , vedanta already to compete and better equipped. Dividends will reduce from this year itself ( prediction ). People will tell coal is still need for powerplants yes we need but if coal is cheap internationally and we get high grade coal is better to import. coal india has no pricing power , it only fills Babu's pocket not retail investor pocket. Even Paragh Parik has divested huge amounts of coal india. Over all it is going to be a bad stock for shareholders not a value stock Thoughts?",

Pharmaceuticals (Exports: $7.55 billion) \u2013 High Risk\n\n* The U.S. imports a massive amount of **generic drugs** from India.\n* Trump has pushed for **onshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing** in the U.S.\n* **Likely action**: Higher tariffs on **generic medicines** from India to protect U.S. pharma firms.\n\n# 2. Precious Metals & Stones (Exports: $10.17 billion) \u2013 Moderate-High Risk\n\n* India is one of the biggest exporters of **cut and polished diamonds** to the U.S.\n* Trump previously **increased tariffs on Chinese jewelry**; he may do the same to India.\n* **Likely action**: Tariffs on **diamonds and jewelry** to promote local manufacturing.\n\n# 3. Electrical & Electronic Equipment (Exports: $9.89 billion) \u2013 Moderate-High Risk\n\n* Includes **Motherson Sumi, ABB India, and Exide Industries**.\n* India exports **electronic components and auto electronics**, competing with U.S. firms.\n* **Trump previously targeted China with tech-related tariffs.**\n* **Likely action**: Import duties on **Indian auto electronics, semiconductors, and batteries**.\n\n# 4. Automotive & Auto Parts (Exports: $2.58 billion) \u2013 Moderate Risk\n\n* **Hero MotoCorp** and **Motherson Sumi** export motorcycles and auto components.\n* Trump previously **imposed tariffs on European & Chinese auto imports**.\n* **Likely action**: Tariffs on **Indian two-wheelers and auto components** to support U.S. manufacturers.\n\n# 5. Textiles & Apparel (Exports: $2.64 billion) \u2013 Moderate Risk\n\n* India is a **top textile and apparel exporter** to the U.S.\n* Trump **previously imposed tariffs on China\u2019s textile exports**.\n* **Likely action**: Higher duties on **Indian garments** to boost U.S. production.\n\n# 6. Oil & Petrochemicals (Exports: $6.52 billion) \u2013 Low-Moderate Risk\n\n* **Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and ONGC** export refined petroleum to the U.S.\n* The U.S. wants **energy independence**, so **tariffs on Indian oil** could be possible.\n* **Likely action**: A tariff on **Indian refined oil products**, but impact may be low.\n\n# 7. IT & Software Services (Not in the export goods list, but a huge sector) \u2013 Low Risk\n\n* India dominates **IT services and outsourcing** for American companies.\n* Instead of tariffs, Trump might **tighten visa rules (H-1B restrictions)**.\n\nHowever, this is just one parameter, rest you can check in weekly which stocks are already going down and on daily check if they are over bought, this given oppurtunity to enter the market>\n\nI am not against Indian market, I am just a trader who makes money on both sides and right now for this year I am highly bearish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1fvqgtwbc1je1.jpg?width=936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffa245f2acf0d41515f2cf450893277d04806aeb\n\n(My positions today at 10.20 AM, 14th Feb, 2025)  \n",

                "body": "### Portfolio Overview\nYou\u2019ve invested in 14 assets: 12 individual stocks, 1 sectoral ETF (Nifty SBI ETF), and 1 gold ETF (Gold Bees). Total allocation sums to 100%, so I assume this is your full portfolio. Here\u2019s the breakdown by sector/type based on your holdings:\n\n- **Energy/PSUs**: NTPC (6.64%), NTPC Green (9.28%), ONGC (6.97%), IOC (4.81%), IRFC (5.56%) \u2013 **33.26%**\n- **Finance**: SBI (7.66%), Manappuram (6.13%), Bajaj Housing Finance (2.55%) \u2013 **16.34%**\n- **Pharma**: Dr. Reddy\u2019s (5.82%), Natco Pharma (6.96%) \u2013 **12.78%**\n- **Auto**: Tata Motors (9.41%) \u2013 **9.41%**\n- **IT**: Wipro (7.23%) \u2013 **7.23%**\n- **FMCG**: ITC (4.87%) \u2013 **4.87%**\n- **ETFs**: Nifty SBI ETF (6.02%), Gold Bees (9.96%) \u2013 **15.98%**\n\n**Key Observations**:\n- Heavy PSU exposure (33.26%), especially energy-related (NTPC, ONGC, IOC, IRFC).\n- Diversified across sectors, but concentrated in a few stocks (e.g., NTPC Green, Tata Motors, Gold Bees each ~9-10%).\n- Current ETF allocation (Nifty SBI + Gold Bees) is ~16%, with intent to increase it.\n\n### Performance Context: Down 20% Since July 2024\nYou started investing in July 2024, and as of March 2, 2025 (8 months later), you\u2019re down 20%. Let\u2019s contextualize this:\n- **Market Trends (July 2024\u2013March 2025)**: The Nifty 50, a broad market benchmark, grew ~5-7% in this period (based on historical trends and assuming no major crash by March 2025). However, midcaps, smallcaps, and PSUs (where you\u2019re heavily invested) saw volatility\u2014some PSU stocks corrected 15-25% after a 2023-early 2024 rally.\n- **Your Portfolio**: A 20% loss suggests your picks underperformed the broader market, likely due to sector-specific declines or stock selection.\n\n**Is This Normal?**: For a beginner starting mid-2024:\n- Yes, it\u2019s possible. Markets don\u2019t always go up, and 2024 saw profit booking in PSU and midcap stocks after a multi-year bull run.\n- No, it\u2019s not ideal. A 20% drop against a flat-to-up broader market indicates some stock-specific or allocation issues.\n\n**Red Flags**:\n- **Wipro**: IT sector faced headwinds in 2024 (US slowdown, fewer contracts). Fundamentally weaker than peers.\n- **PSU Overweight (IRFC, NTPC, ONGC, IOC)**: 2024 saw PSU profit-taking after a 2023 boom\u2014your timing might\u2019ve coincided with this.\n- No glaring \u201cwrong\u201d stocks, but high exposure to volatile PSUs and midcaps likely amplified your loss.\n\n\n- **Current Volatility**: \n  - PSU-heavy (33%) and midcaps (e.g., Manappuram, Natco) are volatile\u201420% drop reflects this.\n  - Gold Bees (10%) and Nifty SBI ETF (6%) are stabilizers, but 16% isn\u2019t enough to offset stock-specific risk.\n- **Plan to Increase Nifty ETF & Gold**:\n  - **Nifty ETF**: Tracks Nifty 50, low volatility (~15-20% annualized), diversified across sectors. Increasing this (e.g., to 15-20%) balances your PSU tilt.\n  - **Gold**: Low correlation to stocks, hedges inflation. Boosting to 15% (from 10%) makes sense\u2014gold\u2019s uptrend in 2024 supports this.\n- **Suggestion**: Trim high-risk stocks (e.g., NTPC Green, Tata Motors\u2014your 9%+ bets) to fund ETFs. Aim for 20% Nifty ETF + 15% Gold (35% low-volatility assets).\n\n### My View on Your Portfolio\n- **Strengths**: Decent diversification (energy, finance, pharma, etc.), some defensive picks (ITC, Gold), PSU exposure taps government growth themes.\n- **Weaknesses**: \n  - Overweight PSUs (33%) at a volatile time\u2014your 20% loss likely stems from this correction.\n  - High single-stock bets (9-10% in Tata Motors, NTPC Green) amplify risk for a beginner.\n  - Wipro\u2019s underperformance is a weak link.\n- **Is Something Wrong?**: Not fundamentally\u2014your stocks aren\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d picks. The issue is timing (bought at peaks?) and allocation (too much in volatile segments).\n- **Normalcy**: A 20% drop in 8 months isn\u2019t rare for a stock-heavy portfolio in a corrective phase, but it\u2019s steeper than the market\u2014adjustments can help.\n\n\n### Recommendations\n1. **Rebalance**:\n   - Reduce NTPC Green, Tata Motors to 5-6% each.\n   - Exit or trim Wipro (swap for a stronger IT stock like Infosys if you want IT).\n   - Boost Nifty ETF to 15-20% and Gold Bees to 15%.\n2. **Hold Steady**: ITC, Dr. Reddy\u2019s, SBI, ONGC are solid\u2014don\u2019t panic-sell losses.\n3. **Learn Timing**: Use SIPs for ETFs to avoid buying at peaks.\n4. **Review**: Check your cost price vs. March 2025 levels\u2014share specifics if you want deeper analysis.",

Consistent Divided payout - the company should have expressed an intention of paying out dividends in the future via a Dividend Payout Policy, what if the company stops paying dividend like Intel USA?\n\n2. Future Prospects of the company - i also want the principle amount to grow as well, hence I invest in divided paying companies which have a future prospects; even if the share appreciates nominally, I'm fine with it.\n\nSome examples of Dividend paying stocks in my portfolios are - REC, Coal India, PowerGrid, TCS, HCLTech & ITC. \n\nApart from the equity part i also accumulate -\nEmbassy REIT & IndiGrid InvIT. Earlier I was also accumulating PowerGrid INVIT but then they expressed their intentions of not acquiring any assests in the medium term (which in my opinion was negative) \n\nIf you need any other help, do let me know in my DM !!",

I have been investing a portion of sum in these since 2020. \n\nThere are only 4 REITs and 2-3 InVITs. I have invested in Brookfield at 248 and it has more or less given Rs. 20 per year per share. It is also appreciated to 334 but currently hovering around 260. Lately I bought Nexus REIT (did a SIP) with avg that cost 121 and the all time high was 154..\n\nMind you, I see them as FD that gives me payout every quarter plus capital appreciation over a really long term (10-15 years) \n\n I also own PGInVIT and IRB InVIT but they didn't give much capital appreciation.

        "selftext": "\n\nMy analysis: I have  Suzlon as my second-biggest holding while I also have Power Grid. It's like betting on both the past and future of Indian energy at the same time. But here's the real question: I am basically playing both sides of the energy transition? \n\nPower Grid is the 'boomer stock' that everyone's uncle recommends (steady dividends, government backing, can't go wrong), while Suzlon is the 'millennial renewable play' that could either 10x or go to zero. It's like having one foot in 1990 and another in 2050.\n\nBefore you forget about this post - I'm genuinely curious: What's everyone's take on this strategy? Is this brilliant diversification or just confusion? \ud83e\udd14\n\n\nPlease be patient and read ahead main fun starts here \u270c\ufe0f\n\nHey r/IndianStockMarket! \n\nI've got a portfolio of 17 stocks that I've built up, and I could really use some experienced eyes on this. Currently sitting at \u20b93.52L total value with about \u20b92.25L invested (56% returns so far).\n\nMy biggest positions:\n- Power Grid (400 shares)\n- Suzlon Energy (1391 shares)\n- Wipro (202 shares)\n\nSome smaller bets:\n- Various small positions in ITC, IEX, ONGC\n- A few micro-positions like IDFC First Bank (1 share) and ITC Hotels (2 shares)\n\nI'm particularly wondering:\n1. Am I too diversified for a \u20b93.5L portfolio?\n2. What do you think about my heavy exposure to energy (Power Grid + Suzlon)?\n3. Should I consolidate some of these smaller positions?\n4. Any glaring red flags you see?\n5. Your suggestion for improvements\n\nFeel free to be brutally honest - I'm here to learn! \ud83d\ude4f\n\n\n  ",

        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

The firm believes the recent correction in ONGC's shares, which seemed excessive, presents a recovery opportunity.\n\nLet's see what the chart is saying : ONGC has recently corrected by around 36% but has shown significant upward momentum over the past two days. The price is currently positioned at the Fibonacci golden zone, a critical level indicating a possible trend reversal. Moreover, a clear RSI divergence on the daily time frame adds to the bullish sentiment.\n\nThe stock has successfully closed above the 40 EMA and 20 SMA on the daily chart, signaling positive momentum. However, for a decisive move upward, ONGC needs to break through the key resistance level at \u20b9267, coinciding with the 40-week EMA.\n\nThe Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) supports this outlook, with a new buy signal on the weekly time frame and continued buy mode on the daily chart. A close above \u20b9267 could pave the way for a strong upward rally.",

It is a PSU stock so any government policy change can have an impact on ONGC's growth and profit and \n\n(2.) ONGC is an upstream company. (Upstream refers to the initial stages of oil and gas production, like exploration and production) , so it is heavily affected by international crude oil price and global events can affect crude oil prices. Certain geographical events - political events in regions with large oil reserves can disrupt crude oil supply. Any war, pandemic, bad weather. So if crude oil supply is affected then ONGC's share price is affected.... So some people underestimate ONGC due to its dependence on international crude oil and global events.",

        "selftext": "Hello guys. So i have a few stocks in my portfolio which are at 100+% profit currently (airtel, coalindia, exide, ITC, ONGC). They have essentially doubled my invested amount. My question is whether i should sell these stocks and book profit as they might have attained their peak, or should i hold them for long term in my portfolio? Also, should i keep buying more shares of these companies??",

For critical minerals NMDC, NALCO , vedanta already to compete and better equipped. Dividends will reduce from this year itself ( prediction ). People will tell coal is still need for powerplants yes we need but if coal is cheap internationally and we get high grade coal is better to import. coal india has no pricing power , it only fills Babu's pocket not retail investor pocket. Even Paragh Parik has divested huge amounts of coal india.  Over all it is going to be a bad stock for shareholders not a value stock Thoughts?",

They recently got new projects\n\nONGC seemed very fairly priced so slowly making positions\n\nVBL financials also seemed good\n\nBuidling position in goldbees to balance the portfolio\n\nEV india is because I believe in the future of EVs\n\nMidcap etf to invest in some high potential stocks",

The firm believes the recent correction in ONGC's shares, which seemed excessive, presents a recovery opportunity.\n\nLet's see what the chart is saying : ONGC has recently corrected by around 36% but has shown significant upward momentum over the past two days. The price is currently positioned at the Fibonacci golden zone, a critical level indicating a possible trend reversal. Moreover, a clear RSI divergence on the daily time frame adds to the bullish sentiment.\n\nThe stock has successfully closed above the 40 EMA and 20 SMA on the daily chart, signaling positive momentum. However, for a decisive move upward, ONGC needs to break through the key resistance level at \u20b9267, coinciding with the 40-week EMA.\n\nThe Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) supports this outlook, with a new buy signal on the weekly time frame and continued buy mode on the daily chart. A close above \u20b9267 could pave the way for a strong upward rally.",

Additionally, I can manage to pay off my loan in a few months (maximum 4-5 months).\n\nI would appreciate your guidance on whether this is a good decision and any advice or suggestions you might have. \n\n\nI\u2019m planning to invest between October and December, and I intend to hold some investments until the U.S. election period and results. What are your thoughts on this? Kindly guide me.\n\n\n\nPersonal context : I am 28, No loan in my name, been investing for 5 years so far, credit score is good (781+) and not doing any trading or other stuff.",

Im 30M who started investing in stocks and Mutual funds since 2022. \n\nCurrently I hold a decent Mutual fund portfolio with Xirr of 23% (as of today) and holds quite a few stocks which you can see in the SC.\nI dont feel like my stocks have been performing good lately. They have been collectively giving me very reduced returns for a while now which is why I am here to ask you some suggestions. \nI have been thinking whether its a good idea to sell the stocks and invest those money in the better performing MF ? Or should I just hold to the stocks hoping for a good returns in the future?\n\nCan you please give me some advice on this?\n\nThanks in advance",

There is a lot to learn in fundamental analysis, how to assess a company and value its stock. Also you might find that despite your best efforts it's not possible to beat the index and it might be best to just buy index funds or mutual funds.\n\nIt's a long journey, you will learn along the way.",

Can you tell me the weighted average PE and PEG ratio for your portfolio.\n\nAlso, don't hold PSUs and IT as of now. They are highly overvalued. This is a bull market where even a paanwala can make money. The markets can crash anytime with a trigger. So be prepared for a 20-40% dip on your portfolio. \n\nHaving said this,  since you're just 18, I'll advise not to invest all your money in the market. Also, try to invest in skills rather than the market at this stage. If you're interested in finance, try to study it. Books like Damodaran etc are classics. It will help you understand valuations. I read it more than a decade back. It's still a classic. Investing is not easy. It looks easy in a bull market where everything has shot through the roof.\n\nAlso, 3 years is not a long term horizon. It's a mid-term, time frame. When the markets crash, which they will, there is no time-frame as to how long will they take to reach back to previous levels. It can take ages for some stocks. Some stocks never recover.",

Now I am working full time and have more capacity to invest. \n\nI am looking for long horizon investments. I am sitting on 30-40% cash right now and looking to diversify my portfolio as you can see it is concentrated on Financials and Financial Services heavily. \n\nI am an investor who likes to buy beaten down stocks, which have good fundamentals but are not in heavy demand right now. \n\nHave the following sectors in my mind: \n\n1. Heard alot of steel sector rotation. Thinking of HINDZINC. Dominant player of silver and zinc production. \n\n2. a) IONEXCHANGE. Water treatment will have growing demand in future. b) JASH INDUSTRIES is involved in manufacturing water pumping and other related machines. \n\n3. ONGC holds 71% share in crude oil and natural gas production. Gas demand will go up for CNG cars as they are more affordable and do not require EV stations infra. \n\n4. Please suggest pharmacy/health stocks as Apollo, max all seem highly inflated. I had booked 30% profits on ICICIPRULI this quarter. \n\n5. Glazing defense stocks as they are beaten down. \n\nPlease suggest any improvements I should make to my pf!!!",
