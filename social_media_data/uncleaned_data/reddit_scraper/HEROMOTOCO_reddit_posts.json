After a sharp decline, it now appears to be entering a pullback phase. On the daily timeframe, the stock is forming an RSI divergence, supported by a buy signal from the Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI). The RMI is already in buy mode on the daily chart and has generated a fresh buy signal on the weekly timeframe. The stock is currently trading above the 20-day SMA of the Bollinger Bands, and if it closes above the 40-day EMA, supported by RSI divergence and RMI, it could indicate a short-term upward move in the form of a pullback.",

Same is with JIO financials. \n\nWith Cochin you paid a multiple of around 60 now thats compressing. Companies in these sector trade at 15-20 PE max so the compression will be detrimental.  \n\nHAL is good , its just valuations but long term is good and major reason is that now MF are moving away from this sector because the momentum in defence stocks is over and Valuation correction is happening. \n\nPNB just get rid of it before it destory your capital. Its a PSU BANK with bad capital allocation and management. Dont get trapped by LOW PE in this stock, market is pricing PNB at such low multiple for a reason. It has already eroded 40-50% of capital of investor who invested a decade back. \n\n\nAU has good revenue and eps growth, you just paid a higher PE for sector which is going through a credit cycle, but long term hold will make you profits in this company. \n\nPCBL is a commodity business and lack pricing power so margin profile gets affected by global demand supply issues. They dont have stable FCF and MARGIN profile. Plus interest payment on debt is increasing which is affecting their net profit. \nYou should switch from this. \n\nPNC INFRA has weak order book now because of being disqualified by GOVT, that\u2019s why market is not giving it higher multiple plus it will be hard for then to gain future contracts and management issues are a big red flag. \nIf you want to play infra switch to HG infra \n\n\nHero and BAJAJ are good hold for long term they will compound at 10-15% and both are at attractive valuations. \n\n\nAirtel is at dangerous valuations of 76 but they are gaining market share and can justify it if their eps growth is good. But dont expect huge returns from\nthen because one engine of stock expansion is gone. (PE moved from 30-35 to 80). So now alll depends om their earning to justify the multiples as there is no futher room for expansion on PE . \nOne more things investors in 2013 paid the same multiple and then the PE compressed to 20-30 range and stock went in plateau mode for next 4 years. So you should avoid this habit of overpaying",

Was doing part time work throughout college and managed to save 80% for investments. In 2 years I had 23% XIRR but my main issue was that my portfolio was so diversified that even ~ 200% gains in some stocks had no real meaning (eg - I averaged zomato at rs 75 per share but only bought 12k worth of it, sold it at ~rs 295) I exited the market at the best time, sold all my portfolio at the top (walked away with 95k profit) but I think I messed up my re-entry. I have 50% capital remaining, should I use that to increase my concentration in current stocks or buy other ones? Please give me some solid advice.\n\nPs- I know y'all hate OLA electric but my view is on their battery play instead of their EVs.",

Let me tell you why I back ola, I looked at the global ev industry, and I kid you not not only in evs, India is below all the major countries in almost all industries. In China for example there are more than 1000 companies making batteries, you think this is it? Naah there are whole billion dollars industries revolving around battery components, like anode/cathod, battery chemicals, battery casing, the nanotechnology going inside these batteries. INDIA HAS EXACTLY 0 SUCH COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURS ALL THIS, LITERALLY 0. Now comes ola, saying they will create the whole battery in-house, I repeat the WHOLE BATTERY. Once this is actually done, see how much margin they can have on their products and selling the battery alone too. And let's say bam China imports are banned or the tarrif becomes to high, where will all the major battery importers shift to? India, boom we have OLA. \n\nI know there are companies like Amara raja and Excide, but if OLA is able to do this it will have double benefit, scooters will become cheaper plus if they started selling the battery or even battery components that's a whole new vertical that hasn't been factored into yet.",

After a sharp decline, it now appears to be entering a pullback phase. On the daily timeframe, the stock is forming an RSI divergence, supported by a buy signal from the Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI). The RMI is already in buy mode on the daily chart and has generated a fresh buy signal on the weekly timeframe. The stock is currently trading above the 20-day SMA of the Bollinger Bands, and if it closes above the 40-day EMA, supported by RSI divergence and RMI, it could indicate a short-term upward move in the form of a pullback.",

When you'll be in loss you'll think \"Maybe now the price will go up. Maybe I should wait a little more. Maybe I should increase my SL...\" etc...\nLearning risk management is one thing. Having the mental balls to implement it in your trade is a totally different thing. The reality is, in trading concepts are very easy to learn. You buy low and sell high. Nothing too complicated in that. But in reality that simple concept plays with your mind and you end up experience tons of things because of it like FOMO, greed, desperation and whatnot... Same goes for risk management. It is easy to understand- you don't risk more than a certain percentage of your capital. But when you're in a trade you start getting emotional and then shit goes south and along with it goes your risk management.\nSo, remember one thing - risk management, discipline... you'll learn none of that in their true sense unless you've spent time in the market. Time in the market prepares your psychology and only with psychology can you actually implement these things...",

Separately, of course, I have a personal equity portfolio as well \u2014 in that, I have been investing ~40% of my capital based on momentum factor for the past couple of years and that has beat the broader market indices by a decent margin. \n\nBeginning today, in this thread, I\u2019ll post top 10 stocks from Nifty50 which are currently experiencing high momentum. I\u2019ll update this list on a weekly basis. \n\nIf I see interest in these lists, I\u2019ll post high momentum stocks from small- and mid-caps as well. I have a couple of smallcases as well (freely available) that are also based on momentum tracking. These have given 79% and 20% returns in the past 14 months and 4 months, respectively. \n\nDisclaimer: THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE. I\u2019M NOT A SEBI REGISTERED ENTITY.

After a sharp decline, it now appears to be entering a pullback phase. On the daily timeframe, the stock is forming an RSI divergence, supported by a buy signal from the Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI). The RMI is already in buy mode on the daily chart and has generated a fresh buy signal on the weekly timeframe. The stock is currently trading above the 20-day SMA of the Bollinger Bands, and if it closes above the 40-day EMA, supported by RSI divergence and RMI, it could indicate a short-term upward move in the form of a pullback.",
