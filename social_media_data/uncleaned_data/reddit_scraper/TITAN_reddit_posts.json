        "selftext": "Despite the growing global interest in lab-grown diamonds, Titan\u00a0remains cautious\u00a0about\u00a0entering\u00a0this market in India.\n\n* **Limited\u00a0Customer Demand**:\u00a0Titan, a major player\u00a0in the\u00a0Indian jewelry market, hasn't\u00a0seen much\u00a0interest in lab-grown\u00a0diamonds. Their MD, C.K. Venkataraman, notes that\u00a0customers across their\u00a0brands\u00a0like Tanishq and\u00a0CaratLane prefer\u00a0natural diamonds. The focus is\u00a0on\u00a0authenticity rather than lab-grown\u00a0options.\n* **Cultural Differences**:\u00a0Unlike\u00a0the US, where\u00a0Hollywood glamorizes big\u00a0diamonds, Indian\u00a0culture doesn't\u00a0emphasize large\u00a0stones. This cultural difference\u00a0affects demand, with Indian\u00a0women not\u00a0typically seeking\u00a0large diamonds.\n* **Brand Value\u00a0and Trust**:\u00a0Tanishq, Titan's flagship brand, is known\u00a0for natural diamonds. Entering the lab-grown market\u00a0could dilute\u00a0this reputation. Plus, Indian consumers are skeptical about the sustainability\u00a0claims of\u00a0lab-grown diamonds, given\u00a0their energy-intensive production.\n* **Market Volatility**:\u00a0The\u00a0US\u00a0lab-grown diamond market\u00a0has\u00a0seen rapid\u00a0growth but also instability, leading to\u00a0price drops. Titan's investment\u00a0in Clean\u00a0Origins, a US-based\u00a0lab-grown diamond\u00a0company, resulted in\u00a0losses, making\u00a0them cautious about similar ventures in India.\n* **Focus on Existing Strengths**:\u00a0Titan sees\u00a0growth potential\u00a0in the natural\u00a0diamond market in\u00a0India. They're expanding into\u00a0new\u00a0cities and strengthening their existing market presence, leveraging\u00a0their established\u00a0trust and brand value.\n* **Strategic\u00a0Considerations**:\u00a0While\u00a0Titan acknowledges\u00a0the potential of\u00a0lab-grown diamonds, they're\u00a0evaluating their\u00a0strategy carefully. Factors like\u00a0Indian jewelry\u00a0designs, which often use smaller\u00a0diamonds, and\u00a0the perception\u00a0of lab-grown diamonds\u00a0as a store\u00a0of value amid\u00a0falling prices, are\u00a0being considered. Titan plans\u00a0to reveal their\u00a0strategy when ready.\n\nInterestingly, another Tata\u00a0Group company, Trent, has launched\u00a0lab-grown diamonds\u00a0under its Westside brand, suggesting\u00a0the group is\u00a0exploring this market\u00a0through\u00a0different channels. However, Titan remains\u00a0focused on natural\u00a0diamonds, aligning\u00a0with their\u00a0understanding of\u00a0the Indian market\u00a0and\u00a0brand strategy.\n\nWhat do you think, fellow redditors? Do you see a\u00a0future for\u00a0lab-grown\u00a0diamonds in\u00a0India, or\u00a0is Titan right\u00a0to focus\u00a0on natural\u00a0diamonds? Share\u00a0your thoughts!",

The Indian customer is one of the most value-conscious customer segments in the world.",

I personally have problem in one way or another with almost all the influencers who talk about finance in as I might not agree with some of there philosophies, However there are still some diamonds in the dust and here are mine -\n\n1.  Parimal Ade/Yadnya Investment Academy - Good fundamental stock analysis. A bit pushy of there own products but nothing over the top. They talk about market trends but not in a \"buy this that\" way but more like news.\n2.  SOIC - Great analysis framework and they perform actual deep dives into fundamentals of the companies. He tends to go with trends (the trends that are almost about to burst) a lot like the pharma, chemical, semiconductor wave but he shares all the details of the company which paints us a whole picture.\n3. Akshat Shrivastava - Many people named him in the worst category but I personally don't mind him much. He has studied from INSEAD, puts proper disclaimer before any stock analysis (though I find the stock names pretty useless) and generally gives a decent macro picture. Terrible thumbnails & captions though.\n4. LLA - they are **the GOAT** for me. Taught me so much about my taxes, insurances and money in general. No pedaling of stocks or insurances. Kudos to them!\n\n I know I did not sound appreciative of them because I think most of them comes with there own caveats. You got take what you like and I ignore the rest I guess, Would love to here the one's that you find okay.",

I started investing in the PPFAS mutual fund and the persistent system was one of the top holdings. I bought shares worth 45K in 2018. Sold 1/3rd in 2021 and again in 2022 to get advantage of 1 lakh LTCG tax-expectation. Also bought TATA elixir during the same period and sold it when it became 2X.\n\nI did make some money but after seeing the further growth I promised myself that I would never sell  \nunless there is something seriously wrong with the companies I am holding. Have not sold a single stock since March 2022, Remaining 15k of the persistent system is now 2.60 lakhs (17X) in 6 years. I have HDFC Bank, ITC, Persistent System, Arman Finance, Maruti, Titan, ICICI Bank, TCS, and NMDC in my portfolio.\n\nI know my XIRR (22%) may not be impressive in today\u2019s scenario but I would suggest don\u2019t sell your  \nwinner for a small gain. If you are holding good companies, there is potential it could be 25X or 50X in the long term. Also, think what difference it will make to your wealth if u even make 5k in 6 months on a 10k investment. It will surely make a difference if u make 2.5 lakh from 10k. \u00a0\n\nEdit: Corrected Typo of the year of sell.",

        "selftext": "Before I continue I will interate I have this stock from 100 levels, I know most of you will downvote it mostly and it's fine but I had to make sure that retailers are not getting screwed over by rumours and fake news \n\nOver the past month kalyan has gone down 35% from its peak , many are calling it names pump and dump and what not, even abusing motilal oswal who got the stock at 350 (an entry which according to me will never come again) \n\nThe allegations on the management are quite frankly absurd and nonsense, none of it has any proof nor has any sebi investigation been triggered \n\n\nNow you may say \"you are biased cause you hold it\" yes I am , but I also did my own DD on the stock before I entered it even at 100 levels. When Kalyan jewellers did it's ipo back in 2021 they made 125 crores from ofs , yes 125 crores . They made no money from this stock, they instead purchased more on leverage at 530, now go try doing this for the latest stocks most of the ipo is pure ofs, offloading their garbage on retail and retail eating it, find me such a quality management which puts their money where their mouth is, I will wait\n\n\nNow onto the allegations -\n\n1) kalyan jewellers paid mutual funds to buy their shares in the fund, why would a company pay fund managers to buy their company when it's growing at twice the pace of the rest of the industry small or big in size? That too in a 80k crores company, sebi isn't so dumb man please let's get that out of the way\n\n2) IT raid , ED raid, if such raids happen to a business family of their level u will see it on news, they were the 30th richest in india just 2 weeks ago and they have many more unlisted business which makes them a very prominent family of south india, u will see it in news but guess what? U didn't cause it is false\n\n3) if the fund manager bribery was not fluff this one certainly tops the list , apparently they bribed ED to avoid arrest , I have heard better stories from drunk beggars\n\n4) inventory overvaluation, for such a company where their inventory is almost the size of titan there is a huge huge audit process with multiple checks and balances , independent as well, u can't just overvalued ur inventory at that scale, it's a national scandal and it will cause chaos \ud83d\ude02 let's be realistic, kalyan jewellers is one of the top 5 gold importers into the country last year, that's the level at which they deal, inventory overvaluation is absurd at so many levels in this case\n\n5) promotors got FIR, if any such cases are running again it will be all over the news ,it needs to be declared to stock exchange \n\n\nThe overall fall seems to be the product of both the stock being a tad bit overvalued from the top (around 15-20%) along with unfounded rumour mongering, the only ones that made money here are the bears who had a short position in this stock from the very beginning, there was unusual oi in the short side of this stock from December itself , I track it so I noticed it, they refused to sell their shorts even when the stock hit ath, at the time didn't make sense to me , I mean 40% growth update and yet who has the balls to short like that, now it all adds up, they always planned to wait for the promotors trading window to close before they attacked the stock and they chose then business update day to buy cheap shorts as well from open market \n\n\nAbout corporate governance of kalyan have no doubt it's first class\nThe chairman of the board is the former CAG of india vinod rai, he was the one who exposed the 2G scam of the ruling government without being scared of the PMO , he won't be involved or allowing such things to happen under him, it's all a lot of rumours to get cheap stocks by the institutes according to me\n\nIt's a well elaborated short attack according to me , because 2 weeks are over sebi has neither sent any notice to the company nor has there been any news of tax evasion or promotor arrest\n\n\n\nThis also reminds me of a similar attack same time last year and motilal was a top holder in this stock as well, stock market participants may have short term memory but the charts don't forget, polycab\nPolycab had a lot of allegations (which was true considering there was real news as well) stock fell 30% and then went on to give 75% returns in a yearly basis \nI do not believe motilal will invest 10% aum in a company based on a bribe and I do not believe motilal will invest 10% aum without proper check on CG\nNow the rest readers can take it as it may\nI haven't sold a single share in this fall, I don't intend to, I see the stock hitting 1500 in 2 years considering it's forward pe for next year is just 40. Even taking normal or expansion what I said is very fair value for it\n\nI remain long and bullish on the stock, those who say \"don't compare it to titan\" just check the data , data doesn't lie , titan is slipping , they have 8% market share of organised play and kalyan has 7, they had just 4 , just 2 years ago, one is claiming they will hit 10 from the past 3 years one will hit it in a year without needing to make tall claims\nData doesn't lie nor does factual information,\n Good luck investing and take care",

        "selftext": "Gold is quietly having a massive moment. With central banks across the world dumping US bonds and piling into gold due to tariff tensions, geopolitical risks, and weakening trust in the dollar, demand is skyrocketing.\n\nIndia, being one of the largest consumers of gold, stands to benefit both as a market and through smart investing. Physical gold is being picked up not just for tradition, but now also as a hedge. SGBs were a good route but they\u2019ve been stopped for now, and physical gold is taxed only 3% on buying. Gold loans are also gaining traction with rates around 11%, which makes more sense than selling and triggering a 20%+ capital gains tax.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t ignore how gold performs in uncertain times. It\u2019s historically a safe haven when currencies get volatile, bond markets get shaky, and inflation expectations rise.\n\nMy take: Gold will remain strong as long as the de dollarisation trend continues. Countries are stacking gold for a reason and I\u2019m staying long.\n\nWould love to know, are you guys holding physical, ETFs like GoldBees, or looking at gold-related stocks like Titan, Kalyan, or Manappuram?",

Liquidity was the only downside unless someone was okay with secondary market trading. I guess what I meant is I was holding off for more SGBs mainly because of those benefits.

But one has to understand that people did not expect such returns when they invested in these stocks. Its the gradual accumulation and further compounding of the stock value which leads to such returns. Your father's 455% returns are absolute in nature. Ask him for \"CAGR\" returns and then you will see the difference. The CAGR returns would be in order of 15 to 25% in most cases over the long term for stocks.\n\nNow, explore the web and check the returns of the mutual funds which are active for past 15 to 25 years. You will find similar returns in them too.\n\nThe most important factor is to invest in mutual funds or stocks with perseverence and discipline irrespective of the short term volatility. Mutual funds go one step further thst since they have a diversified basket of stocks, laggards like YES bank dont have considerable effect on the overall fund performance.",

        "selftext": "People often look at titan, Asian paints, infosys and so on and say it was obvious it was gonna be a multibagger. But, you are looking at the current company, you aren't looking at it from the lens of a Investor who bought it at say 1990 or 2000's. Stock price growth is dependent on 2 things: 1) pe re-rating 2) profit growth. Most of the gains are made because of 1&2. Not when there is only second part because it's hard for a \"fundamentally good\" company to squeeze more margins or grow in a industry where its already dominant. Your best bet for finding multibaggers are broken companies or companies going through downturns that have debt, poor roce, low growth and so on. ",

        "selftext": "Hi Reddit Family,\n\nA bit of context about myself:\n\nI come from a humble background, without any financial inheritance or prior knowledge of investing. I\u2019ve worked hard to support my family and am currently responsible for my parents and others close to me. At 28, Single and working full-time, I started investing around 2-3 years ago with no prior experience, learning through Reddit, YouTube, and books.\n\nMy focus is on long-term growth, with a goal of reaching 1cr before I turn 30. Achieving this would provide me with a sense of financial security and peace of mind.\n\nTreat me someone who is eager to learn but lacking good network or friends to guide me through these decisions. Your advice would mean a lot to me.\n\nCurrent status of my monthly investment :\n\n* Nifty 50 SIP - Monthly (20k) \n* Nifty next 50 SIP - Monthly (20k) \n* Additional stocks investment - (10k)\n\nSpecifically, I would appreciate your thou/ghts on the following:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e16bz91ij9rd1.png?width=2396&format=png&auto=webp&s=4334e3b3534e987a3f6dfd43a79276fe249d52dd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vlwt7e1ij9rd1.png?width=1910&format=png&auto=webp&s=f136b5c1c098fed073443b724f031b77f6cb83c4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4oh9dc1ij9rd1.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1b772a3e523dd79b61e5aac351ff972f6b3c7da\n\n1. How do you eval/uate my current port/folio, and what improvements could I make?\n2. What actions or strategies should I focus on to potentially reach 1cr before 30? Additionally, how much more investment would be necessary to achieve that goal, currently investing around \\~50/month?\n3. I will be receiving a bonus of approximately 8L next month, what would be the best strategy to invest it wisely?\n\nThank you for your time and expertise. Happy to hear your thou/ghts on how I can improve my approach and avoid common mistakes :)",

With a portfolio already at \u20b940 lakhs, you would need to invest about \u20b92 lakh per month via SIP to meet your financial goals.\n\nI suggest you avoid chasing higher returns by taking unnecessary risks, like investing in penny stocks or derivatives for short-term gains. These can lead to significant losses over time. Instead, focus on consistently growing your capital. Regular investments in mutual funds, combined with a little exposure to stocks (if you understand them), can be a more sustainable way to create wealth. Aim for a 15-16% CAGR as your target rather than running after speculative returns.",

My decision was based on their extensive retail presence, the cultural demand for gold, and Kalyan\u2019s reputation as a trusted brand.\n\nHowever, the stock has been falling significantly, making me question whether this is just short-term volatility or a sign of deeper issues like weak fundamentals, intense competition, or operational challenges.\n\nFor those familiar with this stock or the jewelry industry, is there reason to believe a recovery is likely, or would it be better to cut my losses now?

Professional Income. \n\nStarted post-Covid. But a substantial sum out of this has been invested in the last 3-4 months.\n\nPoint is to review the portfolio / allocation etc. as it stands today - for the future. That is why I have provided current value of holdings (though invested sum can be calculated pretty easily). Past gains (especially %ages) are indicative of pretty much nothing as I have been irregular in buying and accumulating over the said period.\n\nWould love everyone's views and opinions. \n\nPS - discerning folks on here will be able to see Saurabh Mukherjea's influence but even more discerning (and sympathethic) folks will be able to see I am reducing the said influence now \ud83d\ude04\n\nLATE (AND LONG) EDIT - As rightly said in some replies, MF portfolio has some unnecessary over-complication. I'm slowly moving my inv from Axis ELSS to PP ELSS (as and when 3 year limit ends), so count one less fund. The two PP funds again I count as basically one big Flexi fund, so that's again one less fund. Small caps I don't feel comfortable with just one fund, and the universe is large enough to accommodate two funds. \nSo basically-\n\u2022one Largecap (Niftybees) \n\u2022one Flexicap (2 PPs + whatever's left of Axis)\n\u2022one Large & Mid\n\u2022one Midcap\n\u2022two Smallcaps\n\u2022one USA (where in fact if someone can suggest which should I actually invest in, anyway PP Flexi can't invest more in the US stocks). \n\n",

        "selftext": "WHEN TO SELL A STOCK \u2049\ufe0f\n\nIn our opinion, the most difficult skill in Investing is NOT the ability to find a great stock.\n\nIt is to know WHEN to sell the stock. \n\nWe keep reading - if you had invested money in XYZ stock in 2010, you would have made so much wealth. \ud83d\udcad\n\nBut what happens if you remove the benefit of hindsight. \ud83e\udd14\n\nTake Bajaj Finance for example. The stock was available at Rs 7 (adjusted for bonuses / splits) in 2009. Yes, you read that right! \ud83e\udd11\n\nNow assume someone bought it at 7. Do you think they would have held on till today?\n\nThe investor would have seen the price go to 20, then 50, 100, 1000, 3000, 7000. \n\nAlso a decline from 4800 to 1800 in 2020. \ud83e\udd2f\n\nAt what point do you think the investor would have had enough? \n\nSitting tight on a stock is easier said than done. Behavioral biases would not allow for it. \n\nAdd to that survivorship bias. We keep talking about Infosys, HDFC Bank, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Titan. \u2728\n\nBut for each of these, there is a Unitech, Punj Lloyd, Idea, Suzlon, Yes Bank, which promised gold but went to dust. \ud83e\udd21\n\nAnd others which seemingly were great but stopped going up at one point. Bata, HDFC Bank, Nerolac, IndusInd Bank, Biocon, PVR Inox, Ramco Cement are some of the names that have given < 5% CAGR return over the past 5 years \n\nHow does one know when the stock has done enough. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nSo to us, the toughest skill in investing is to know when to sell a stock. Something that even we are still trying to understand and learn. \n\nWe can learn a lot of concepts to identify great companies. But only those who can master when to sell or hold a stock can really create a process around creating wealth. \ud83d\udcb0\n\n\n#LowRiskInvesting\n#PersonalFinance",

        "selftext": "EID Parry is like that grand old tree in your backyard\u2014rooted deep in history, yet constantly sprouting new branches. It was founded 182 years ago, and if we calculate its lifespan using the\u00a0[Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect), it will still be around in 2206.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just any sugar business; it\u2019s an agricultural titan in disguise, churning out everything from your morning sugar to spirulina, fertilizers and biofuels. So, grab your favourite\u00a0[Mithai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweets_from_the_Indian_subcontinent), and let\u2019s dive in!\n\nContents:\n\n1. Company overview & business model\n2. Balance sheet & capital allocation\n3. Valuation\n4. Risks\n5. Future growth potential\n6. Conclusion & sources\n\n# Company overview & business model\n\nEID Parry is part of the\u00a0[Murugappa group](https://mysuccessproject.in/murugappa-group-explore-the-120-years-legacy/), one of the oldest business groups in India with 28+ businesses and a long history of fiduciary responsibility.\n\n* Parry is the largest sugar manufacturer in South India. It started in 1842, when it opened the country\u2019s first ever sugar plant at Nellikuppam, Tamil Nadu\n* 30% of the sugar output is sold under the Parry brand, while 70% is sold in bulk.\n   * The management team have indicated that they are planning to \u201cmove up the value chain\u201d, with more focus on their branded line of sugar and nutraceuticals (spirulina , palmetto etc.).\n   * The Indian government curbed\u00a0[sugar exports in 2023](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/india-extends-curbs-sugar-exports-calm-domestic-prices-2023-10-18/), in order to control domestic sugar prices\n   * To combat the sugar business's cyclicality, Parry has also significantly invested in distillery capacity, aligning with the Indian government's plan for increased domestic energy supply.\n* Their branded sugar and FMCG business (27% of their revenue) is scaling rapidly, with the number of distribution outlets increasing from 20k in 2021 to 110k currently\n* Apart from this, they also have a power generation and sugar refinery businesses, both of which have struggled to maintain profitability. These two business have depressed the margins over the last five years, which were around 1% on average.\n* Even if loss-making units break even, margins would only increase to a razor-thin 2-3%, reflecting the commoditized nature of the sugar industry.\n\n# Holding company structure\n\nThe Murugappa group took over EID Parry in 1981 and now own 38.3% of business. EID Parry, in turn, owns 56% of Coromandel International, which it had co-founded in the 1960s.\n\n* Coromandel is the largest private phosphatic fertiliser manufacturer, and 2nd largest overall. The company enjoys 60% market share in the \u2018Rice Bowl\u2019 regions of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana\n* Around half of Coromandel\u2019s sales come from exports, where they see significant headroom for growth\n* [IFFCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Farmers_Fertiliser_Cooperative), which is a Fertiliser Cooperative, is the largest fertilizer producer in India, with roughly twice the revenues of Coromandel. Coromandel has been gaining market share, with revenues growing \\~11% CAGR since 2019, while IFFCOs sales have remained flat\n\n# Balance sheet and capital allocation\n\n* EID Parry had significant debt before 2020 but has since paid down a majority, leading to a fortress-like balance sheet and net cash of \u20b923 billion (\u20b92300 crore) as of March 2024\n* This gives them flexibility to invest in sugar-adjacent businesses (like distillery & nutraceuticals) and buy depressed assets during market downturns.\n* Capital allocation has been hit-and-miss, with some of their ventures like Coromandel and the sugar distillery investments generating high ROCE , while other ones like the refinery have had very poor returns.\n   * Overall , ROCE has been exceptional, averaging 26% since 2017\n   * The management has expressed interest in further inorganic expansion in the FMCG space, but they have been pretty prudent so fair in sizing their capital investments, while maintaining a pristine balance sheet\n   * Parry have also reduced their Coromandel stake from 60%+ to 56% currently. But don\u2019t seem to have any plans to further trim their position.\n* They haven\u2019t fully reinvested their earnings. So, they do pay out dividends and have built up a cash position. An approximate capital deployment break-down over the last few years:\n   * 50% re-invested into CAPEX\n   * 30% paid out in dividend\n   * 20% going to debt repayment or cash reserves\n\n# Valuation\n\nMany of the previous valuations I\u2019ve read online seem to take a comparative valuation approach with a \u201cHold-Co discount\u201d added on top. However, I chose to employ a discounted cash flow analysis, assuming the earnings of Coromandel will flow through to EID Parry shareholders eventually, either via dividends or incremental equity ownership.\n\nWarren Buffett follows a similiar approach, by using \u201c[look-though earnings](https://mastersinvest.com/newblog/2017/2/19/the-buffett-series-focus-on-the-earnings)\u201d to value Berkshire Hathaway and other holding companies. Subsidiaries should only pay dividends if they cannot re-invest capital in their business at a high hurdle rate.\n\nMy estimates for value per share are given below. The full assumptions can be found\u00a0[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lm1JZtfuQudOFddkLIAPrMp7RLtx5_Zj/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114836972199643253007&rtpof=true&sd=true). \n\n[Value per share](https://imgur.com/lZDYxbz)\n\n* Bear:  **\u20b9645**\n* Base: **\u20b9911**\n* Bull: **\u20b91,267**\n\nNotes:\n\n* The Coromandel stake represents \\~70% of EID Parry\u2019s value per share, so it forms a core part of the investment thesis. At current prices, you are essentially getting the sugar business and assets for \u201cfree\u201d, as the Coromandel stake and net cash are worth \u20b9755\n* If I valued the Coromandel stake at their current market price instead of using a discounted cash flow method, EID\u2019s 56% ownership of Coromandel equals \u20b91112 per share (after subtracting 25% in taxes) - 20% higher than my bull case estimate of \u20b9914. The markets seem to be valuing Coromandel with double-digit growth expectations for the next decade.\n\nI had initially bought EID Parry in March 2022 and added to my position subsequently, so my average cost is \u20b9508 (much lower than current levels). The stock now looks close to fairly valued, with the gap between price and value narrowing significantly since the beginning of 2024. The stock currently represents 10% of my India portfolio - I plan to hold it for the next several years (or ideally forever).\n\n[PPFAS](https://amc.ppfas.com/), a mutual fund I follow, has also invested in EID Parry since January 2024. However, it currently represents a small portion (0.2%) of their flexi-cap fund. They appear to have stopped adding to their position since February 2024, when the share price was around \u20b9600.\n\n# Future growth potential\n\nThe current stock price seems fairly valued, but provides some free \u201ccall options\u201d that I haven\u2019t consider yet in the valuation:\n\n* EID Parry\n   * Indian sugar consumption could grow significantly: Indian per-capita consumption is around\u00a0[22kg per year](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sugar-projections-consumption-per-capita_5jrzxx43xv37.pdf), while developed countries are at\u00a0[36kg per year](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sugar-projections-consumption-per-capita_5jrzxx43xv37.pdf).\n   * The Indian government drops the sugar export ban, leading to higher sugar realization prices\n   * The Indian government ramps up the Ethanol blending program to reduce reliance on energy imports (similiar to\u00a0[Brazil](https://www.energy-observer.org/resources/bioethnaol-brazilian-success-story))\n   * FMCG grows to become a significant part of the business (similiar to\u00a0[ITC](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/itcs-fmcg-business-set-to-touch-4-billion-mark/articleshow/111352796.cms)\u2019s successful scale-up)\n   * The freehold land bank owned by EID Parry, which they estimate to be valued at \u20b9394 Cr (or \u20b922 per share of EID Parry)\n* Coromandel could significantly ramp up export volumes: their current capacity is 4.5MMT (million metric ton), while the largest global crop nutrient manufacturers are close to\u00a0[20\\~30MMT](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1266558/plant-capacity-largest-fertilizer-manufacturers-worldwide/)\n\n# Risks\n\n* EID Parry\n   * Global sugar prices plummet lower than EID\u2019s production costs, leading to under-utilization and losses\n   * The Indian government sets the MSP (minimum support price) for sugar purchases from farmers and could end up squeezing EID\u2019s sugar margins.\n   * Poor monsoons or pest related issues in South India, leading to lower sugar cane yields\n* Coromandel faces significant litigation risks related to toxic chemical handling. The most recent example was a\u00a0[gas leak at Ennore on Dec 2023](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chennai/ennore-gas-leak-tamil-nadu-govt-panel-coromandel-pay-penalty-9144811/), which resulted in a fine of \u20b96\u00a0Cr.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nEID Parry appears to be well positioned, both on the production and consumption side of India\u2019s agriculture food chain.\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\nYou can view additional graphics in the article [here](https://opensourceinvestor.substack.com/p/eid-parry-nseeidparry-an-agriculture).\n\nThanks,  \nSharad  \n[OpenSourceInvestor @ Substack](https://opensourceinvestor.substack.com/)",

The nation boasts no discernible edge in productivity or innovation\u2014merely a reliance on borrowed momentum and cheap labor dressed up as competitive advantage. Corporate earnings among the Nifty 50, the supposed titans of this economy, are stagnating at levels unseen in half a decade\u2014sales creeping up by a pitiful 5%, profits effectively flat. Yet the market trades at a delusional 24x earnings, as if fairy tales of perpetual growth can defy arithmetic. This is not resilience; it is recklessness.\n\nThe global tide is turning, and India is woefully unprepared. The United States teeters on the brink of recession, its shadow darkening every emerging market. Trump\u2019s tariff saber-rattling threatens to gut India\u2019s export-driven sectors\u2014IT and pharmaceuticals, face annihilation. Foreign institutional investors have already scented the rot, withdrawing \u20b92 lakh crore since October 2024, redirecting capital to China\u2019s more disciplined ascent. India\u2019s market capitalization has hemorrhaged $1 trillion, and the exodus is accelerating. Midcaps and smallcaps, inflated beyond reason, shed 3-4% in a day\u2014portents of a bubble\u2019s violent end.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India is a bystander, its hands tied by a rupee in freefall and inflation rising like a specter from the grave. Oil prices, stoked by Middle Eastern turmoil, will only tighten the noose. Domestically, the picture is bleaker still. Non-performing assets haunt the banking sector anew, liquidity is a mirage, and the government peddles populist distractions while the real economy erodes. India\u2019s much-vaunted demographic dividend? A myth\u2014a workforce lacking the skills or infrastructure to compete in a world that rewards precision, not population.\n\nIndia\u2019s software and manufacturing exports, long propped up by low-cost labor and rote outsourcing, face an existential threat from artificial intelligence. The IT sector, a $200 billion crutch built on coding drones and call centers, is now redundant\u2014AI systems can churn out code, debug, and automate workflows at a fraction of the cost, slashing demand for India\u2019s legion of middling programmers. Manufacturing, already a feeble 17% of GDP, is no safer; AI-driven robotics and smart factories in rival nations like China and Vietnam outpace India\u2019s outdated plants, rendering its cheap hands obsolete. Lacking innovation to pivot, India\u2019s export engine is poised to stall\u2014another edge lost to machines it neither owns nor understands.\n\nLet us dispense with illusions: India\u2019s edge is an illusion sustained by speculative froth, not innovation. Its productivity lags global peers\u2014manufacturing languishes at 17% of GDP, a figure unchanged in decades, while competitors like Vietnam and Indonesia leap ahead. The startup ecosystem, heralded as a savior, churns out copycat apps and overvalued unicorns, not breakthroughs. This is not a nation forging the future; it is one coasting on fumes, betting on sentiment rather than substance.\n\nThe collapse is coming, and it will be merciless. The \u20b913.95 lakh crore lost in the Yes Bank debacle of 2020 will seem trivial when this unravels\u2014market circuits will trip, panic will reign, and the retail investor, lured by tales of endless rallies, will be left with ashes. I have seen this script before: over-leveraged hope meets unforgiving reality. My advice is simple\u2014exit now. Liquidate your positions, secure your capital, and watch from a distance as the inevitable unfolds. India\u2019s markets are not a phoenix; they are a pyre awaiting ignition.\n\nYours in sober observation,\n\nShameless Steel",

I used to pass through their building, and It may sound funny but one of the reasons to check the company was because I liked their office names. I started investing in the PPFAS mutual fund and the persistent system was one of the top holdings. I bought shares worth 45K in 2018. Sold 1/3rd in 2021 and again in 2022 to get advantage of 1 lakh LTCG tax-expectation. Also bought TATA elixir during the same period and sold it when it became 2X.\n\nI did make some money but after seeing the further growth I promised myself that I would never sell  \nunless there is something seriously wrong with the companies I am holding. Have not sold a single stock since March 2022, Remaining 15k of the persistent system is now 2.60 lakhs (17X) in 6 years. I have HDFC Bank, ITC, Persistent System, Arman Finance, Maruti, Titan, ICICI Bank, TCS, and NMDC in my portfolio.\n\nI know my XIRR (22%) may not be impressive in today\u2019s scenario but I would suggest don\u2019t sell your  \nwinner for a small gain. If you are holding good companies, there is potential it could be 25X or 50X in the long term. Also, think what difference it will make to your wealth if u even make 5k in 6 months on a 10k investment. It will surely make a difference if u make 2.5 lakh from 10k. \u00a0\n\nEdit. Corrected the sell date.",

        "selftext": "Exide has a much bigger market share historically, especially in automotive (cars, trucks), industrial batteries, inverter batteries, and telecom power solutions. It's been around forever and is deeply entrenched.\n\nAmara raja came later but focused heavily on higher quality, longer-life batteries. They built a strong brand in maintenance-free automotive batteries and in industrial UPS (uninterruptible power supply) solutions.\n\n**Exide:**  \nSet up\u00a0**Exide Energy Solutions**, a new subsidiary focused only on lithium-ion batteries.\n\n* Building a\u00a0**large gigafactory**\u00a0for lithium-ion cell manufacturing (in Karnataka).\n* They\u2019ve also tied up with Chinese companies (like SVOLT) for technical know-how \u2014 mainly because making Li-ion cells is a different game from making lead-acid batteries.\n\nTech-focus:  \nMainly focusing on\u00a0**Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP)**\u00a0and\u00a0**Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC)**\u00a0chemistries.\n\n* Through partnerships (especially with\u00a0**SVOLT Energy**, a Chinese company), they\u2019re accessing:\n   * **LFP**: safer, cheaper, longer life \u2014 good for mass-market EVs, buses, and grid storage.\n   * **NMC**: higher energy density \u2014 good for premium EVs (more range, smaller battery).\n* Exide is not talking much about solid-state yet (they're still focused on scaling basic Li-ion first).\n* Also minor activities in\u00a0**advanced lead-acid**\u00a0tech for hybrid vehicles (like Start-Stop batteries).\n\n**Amara Raja:**\n\n* They have announced plans for a\u00a0**Giga Corridor**\u00a0\u2014 a cluster to manufacture lithium cells and battery packs, plus a recycling plant.\n* They are investing in\u00a0**research partnerships**\u00a0(with IITs, etc.) and setting up an\u00a0**Energy and Mobility R&D center**.\n* Amara Raja seems to be targeting\u00a0**energy storage systems (ESS)**\u00a0too \u2014 not just EVs, but also grid backup, renewables, etc.\n\nTech Fodus:  \nAlso focused on\u00a0**LFP**\u00a0and\u00a0**NMC**\u00a0\u2014 similar chemistry bets.\n\n* But they are\u00a0**more vocal**\u00a0about working on\u00a0**solid-state batteries**\u00a0and\u00a0**lithium-titanate (LTO)**\u00a0chemistries in their R&D.\n   * **Solid-state batteries**: potentially safer, denser, future of EVs \u2014 still 3-5 years away commercially.\n   * **LTO**: fast-charging, super-safe but heavier and lower energy density \u2014 great for grid storage and buses, less for cars.\n\nTheir\u00a0*Energy & Mobility Research Centre*\u00a0is supposed to be exploring beyond just classic Li-ion.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShort term/ Long term:\n\n**Exide is clearly more aggressive today.**\n\n* They've already committed \u20b96,000+ crore for their gigafactory.\n* Their JV with SVOLT gives them\u00a0**ready access**\u00a0to proven Li-ion cell tech (important because making\u00a0*cells*\u00a0is much harder than assembling\u00a0*packs*).\n* They have a running timetable: start production 2025\u201326.\n\n**Amara Raja is still playing cautious:**\n\n* They have committed around \u20b99,500 crore\u00a0**over many years**\u00a0for a full corridor \u2014 cells, packs, R&D, recycling.\n* But right now, they are still building facilities.\n* Their serious cell manufacturing will only start 2026\u201327 (if no delays).\n\nMy take on all this:\n\n**Exide is the clear winner short term, if solid state is achieved by amara raja though, we score big. However some major problems: Require great amount of capital. They're focussing on Make in India.. no reliable partnerships for R&D and manufacturing yet.. In the mean time they may fall behind in LFP and NMC scaling as well.. I plan on reassessing Amara Raja sometime in the future, once I have access to more quality info regarding their progress in R&D.**",

        "selftext": "[Reposted from the first thread]\n\nBefore I continue I will interate I have this stock from 100 levels, I know most of you will downvote it mostly and it's fine but I had to make sure that retailers are not getting screwed over by rumours and fake news \n\nOver the past month kalyan has gone down 35% from its peak , many are calling it names pump and dump and what not, even abusing motilal oswal who got the stock at 350 (an entry which according to me will never come again) \n\nThe allegations on the management are quite frankly absurd and nonsense, none of it has any proof nor has any sebi investigation been triggered \n\n\nNow you may say \"you are biased cause you hold it\" yes I am , but I also did my own DD on the stock before I entered it even at 100 levels. When Kalyan jewellers did it's ipo back in 2021 they made 125 crores from ofs , yes 125 crores . They made no money from this stock, they instead purchased more on leverage at 530, now go try doing this for the latest stocks most of the ipo is pure ofs, offloading their garbage on retail and retail eating it, find me such a quality management which puts their money where their mouth is, I will wait\n\n\nNow onto the allegations -\n\n1) kalyan jewellers paid mutual funds to buy their shares in the fund, why would a company pay fund managers to buy their company when it's growing at twice the pace of the rest of the industry small or big in size? That too in a 80k crores company, sebi isn't so dumb man please let's get that out of the way\n\n2) IT raid , ED raid, if such raids happen to a business family of their level u will see it on news, they were the 30th richest in india just 2 weeks ago and they have many more unlisted business which makes them a very prominent family of south india, u will see it in news but guess what? U didn't cause it is false\n\n3) if the fund manager bribery was not fluff this one certainly tops the list , apparently they bribed ED to avoid arrest , I have heard better stories from drunk beggars\n\n4) inventory overvaluation, for such a company where their inventory is almost the size of titan there is a huge huge audit process with multiple checks and balances , independent as well, u can't just overvalued ur inventory at that scale, it's a national scandal and it will cause chaos \ud83d\ude02 let's be realistic, kalyan jewellers is one of the top 5 gold importers into the country last year, that's the level at which they deal, inventory overvaluation is absurd at so many levels in this case\n\n5) promotors got FIR, if any such cases are running again it will be all over the news ,it needs to be declared to stock exchange \n\n\nThe overall fall seems to be the product of both the stock being a tad bit overvalued from the top (around 15-20%) along with unfounded rumour mongering, the only ones that made money here are the bears who had a short position in this stock from the very beginning, there was unusual oi in the short side of this stock from December itself , I track it so I noticed it, they refused to sell their shorts even when the stock hit ath, at the time didn't make sense to me , I mean 40% growth update and yet who has the balls to short like that, now it all adds up, they always planned to wait for the promotors trading window to close before they attacked the stock and they chose then business update day to buy cheap shorts as well from open market \n\n\nAbout corporate governance of kalyan have no doubt it's first class\nThe chairman of the board is the former CAG of india vinod rai, he was the one who exposed the 2G scam of the ruling government without being scared of the PMO , he won't be involved or allowing such things to happen under him, it's all a lot of rumours to get cheap stocks by the institutes according to me\n\nIt's a well elaborated short attack according to me , because 2 weeks are over sebi has neither sent any notice to the company nor has there been any news of tax evasion or promotor arrest\n\n\n\nThis also reminds me of a similar attack same time last year and motilal was a top holder in this stock as well, stock market participants may have short term memory but the charts don't forget, polycab\nPolycab had a lot of allegations (which was true considering there was real news as well) stock fell 30% and then went on to give 75% returns in a yearly basis \nI do not believe motilal will invest 10% aum in a company based on a bribe and I do not believe motilal will invest 10% aum without proper check on CG\nNow the rest readers can take it as it may\nI haven't sold a single share in this fall, I don't intend to, I see the stock hitting 1500 in 2 years considering it's forward pe for next year is just 40. Even taking normal or expansion what I said is very fair value for it\n\nI remain long and bullish on the stock, those who say \"don't compare it to titan\" just check the data , data doesn't lie , titan is slipping , they have 8% market share of organised play and kalyan has 7, they had just 4 , just 2 years ago, one is claiming they will hit 10 from the past 3 years one will hit it in a year without needing to make tall claims\nData doesn't lie nor does factual information,\n Good luck investing and take care",

Additionally, I can manage to pay off my loan in a few months (maximum 4-5 months).\n\nI would appreciate your guidance on whether this is a good decision and any advice or suggestions you might have. \n\n\nI\u2019m planning to invest between October and December, and I intend to hold some investments until the U.S. election period and results. What are your thoughts on this? Kindly guide me.\n\n\n\nPersonal context : I am 28, No loan in my name, been investing for 5 years so far, credit score is good (781+) and not doing any trading or other stuff.",

        "selftext": "**Gorilla Framework is a strategy by Utpal Sheth, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala's right-hand man**. It focuses on investing in dominant companies that lead across market cycles and show long-term growth and adaptability.(This strategy aligns well with my High-quality checklist framework I shared earlier. You can check it out \u00a0)\n\nThese businesses are termed 'gorilla' stocks, similar to a gorilla, because of the dominance they have in the ecosystem thanks to its strength and adaptability across climates.\n\nBy combining this strategy with the **Corporate Cycle framework,** you can improve your stock picking and spot potential gorillas, especially if you identify them in the 2nd or 3rd stage of the corporate cycle.\n\n**What makes a company a gorilla? Five qualities that classify a company as a gorilla:**\n\n* Rare:\u00a0**There are many monkeys in the jungle, but very few gorillas.**\u00a0Gorillas are rare market leaders with unique qualities that set them apart.\n* Dominant:\u00a0**Gorillas are outsized and dominant**. These businesses command the lion's share of their markets and have significant influence over their industries.\u00a0\n* Moats and knights:\u00a0**Gorillas are not challenged by monkeys.**\u00a0They protect their leadership with structural moats, such as branding, distribution, intellectual property and knight-like resilience that fends off competitors.(Asian Paints will be tested again to see if it still holds its dominance as a gorilla, it has proved several times the past)\n* Longevity:\u00a0**A gorilla endures over decades, not just through one cycle**\u00a0Such companies consistently evolve and remain relevant, showcasing their ability to survive and thrive.(Commodities, automobile, and power companies don\u2019t fit this category as they only perform well during upcycles when prices rise due to supply-demand imbalances and supply chain issues or their is a credit and capex cycle)\n* Right jungle, right animal:Every day, you should pray to find the right jungle and the right gorilla.Success lies in aligning with the right industry and identifying its dominant player.(**Focus on companies with long growth potential and large addressable markets. Look into sectors like cybersecurity, the shift of APIs from China, AI ecosystem players, Fiberization**\u00a0**, and India's digitalisation**, **Aerospace,Defence**).\n* Avoid commodities and chemical stocks because firstly they lack pricing power, no real product differentiation and very few parameter align with the high quality checklist framework. Chemical sector is still trading at very expensive valuations and it is not the right jungle and animal for wealth creation.\n\n**5L Grid to spotting gorillas(Gorilla Investing focuses on the first two categories:Legends and Leaders)**\n\nIt is a structured way of understanding where companies stand regarding market importance and leadership potential. It categorises businesses into five types:\n\n# Gorilla investing focuses on the first two categories.\u00a0\n\n* Legends:**They are the rarest of the rare, with enduring dominance over decades.**\u00a0Nestle and\u00a0Apple\u00a0are examples of 'legend' companies, as they have shown long-standing leadership by evolving with their industries and staying relevant over time most of the companies that will fall in this category will be founder driven.\n* Leaders:\u00a0**Leaders are dominant players with the potential to become legends**.Leaders are gorillas in their markets, showing consistent ability to fend off competition and sustain growth.Companies like\u00a0HDFC Bank, TITAN, Bajaj finance, Asian paints are examples of leaders who have demonstrated adaptability and scalability.\n* Laggards: These are businesses that have struggled to grow or adapt.**Laggards fail to capitalise on opportunities, often because of inefficiencies or lack of innovation.**\n* Losers: A company is defined as a 'loser' when it consistently destroys value.**Losers erode shareholder value through poor decisions and structural inefficiencies**\n* Lallus:\u00a0Companies that merely exist without creating significant value.\u00a0**Most companies fall under the Lallus category. They don't destroy value, but they don't create it either; they just exist.**\n\nIn the long run, only a few businesses dominate. Finding these gorillas and investing in them is how wealth is built.\u00a0**I hope you can see the connection between the gorilla framework and the high-quality checklist framework.**\n\nFocus on 'Legends' and 'Leaders', combine them with other frameworks, and adjust your investment strategy.The strategy demands discipline, patience and a deep understanding of what you own and the industry that business operates in.\n\nHappy investing! Share this with your friends and family if you find it helpful\n\nCheck your portfolio and see if you're holding a Gorilla or a Lallu.\n\nJoin\u00a0[r/IndiaGrowthStocks](/r/IndiaGrowthStocks/)\u00a0to learn about new frameworks and explore deep stock analysis",

During his college days, Jhunjhunwala invested his own money, bought 5,000 shares of\u00a0TATA Tea\u00a0for INR 43, sold them for INR 143 per share and made a profit of RS. 5,00,000 in mere three months. His first big profit pushed him to learn more about trading and stock markets. He researched financial principles and stocks, invested, and continued trading. Gradually, he earned 25 lacs from 1986 to 1989 by investing and reinvesting the same principal amount in the market.\n\n\nhttps://www.indmoney.com/blog/how-did-rakesh-jhunjhunwala-become-a-billionaire",

Beekay Steel - Considering the macroeconomics, metal space is due for a run. However, at this point, it may make sense to pick up stocks with returning FII interest or increasing DII interest.\n\nCan review the others if people find this helpful. The point here is that these stocks are unheard of not because they're undervalued, but because they're micro caps. And thus, much more risky.",

I could definitely see a +50% return in the cards for this stock by EOY. I think it will tap out somewhere around $25  if they dont dilute shares. This is a big, established company with a 2.95B market cap. \n\nThey deal with large amounts of money, they have big revenues and they have been at this for a while now. They have a pretty decent EPS and P/E ratio, .95 and 16.86 respectively. I dont really have any exposure to industrials, so I also like how this diversifies my portfolio.

However, futures markets suggest diminishing odds of such a scenario:\n\n* **Nasdaq futures fell 1.2%**\u00a0amid reports that Trump is pressuring advisors to escalate tariffs, raising fears of a U.S.-led global trade war.\n* **Geopolitical risks surged**\u00a0after Putin\u2019s armored convoy exploded in central Moscow, potentially worsening Russia-Ukraine tensions.\n* **April 2nd**\u00a0looms as the deadline for the U.S. to unveil new tariff policies, amplifying market anxiety and safe-haven demand.\n\nAmid this uncertainty, Citi outlines three scenarios:\n\n1. **Reciprocal tariffs only**\u00a0\u2192 Limited market impact.\n2. **Reciprocal tariffs + VAT adjustments**\u00a0\u2192 U.S. dollar could rally 50-100 basis points, pressuring equities.\n3. **Reciprocal tariffs + VAT + sector-specific tariffs**\u00a0\u2192 Deeper equity market correction.\n\nGold has emerged as the top safe-haven play, while short-term traders are bidding up volatility. ORATS data shows\u00a0**elevated near-term implied volatility premiums**, signaling investors are pricing in immediate risks.\n\n**Will April 2nd Trigger a Crash?**\n\nA common question in trading communities reflects market sentiment:\u00a0*\u201cIs now the time to long VIX? Should I enter on March 31 or April 1?\u201d*\n\nBut Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett argues the real inflection point may be\u00a0**April 4th\u2019s nonfarm payrolls data**. Strong jobs numbers could fuel a rebound, while weak data might push the S&P 500 lower. Hartnett emphasizes that\u00a0**macro fundamentals**, not short-term policy noise, will ultimately drive markets.\n\n**Technical Analysis: Key Support Levels**\n\nHistorically, the\u00a0**50-week moving average (MA)**\u00a0has acted as a floor during past corrections. The S&P 500 recently breached this level. A\u00a0confirmed close below the 50-week MA\u00a0this week\u2014especially if sustained\u2014would signal a bearish regime shift, with the next major support at the\u00a0**200-week MA**.\n\nSavvy investors know:\u00a0**Trend confirmation is key**. Opportunities exist in any market:\n\n* **Bull market**: Buy dips in tech titans or undervalued growth stocks. e.g. META, GOOGL, AAPL, AIFU, NET, DOCN, IT, ACN, NVDA, TSLA, ACVA, MA, QTWO, DDOG\n* **Bear market**: Short overvalued growth stocks.\n\n**Will the S&P 500 break below its 50-week MA? Let's wait and see.**",

Normally we see the stock market price in any threat in about 6 months in advance.\n\nIn 2008 & 2009 we had a serious depression and economists warned us about too much debt and inflated stock values. The global monetary strategy should have been decreasing debt (from states and banks to individuals) and improving the strength of economic fundamentals in the west (especially Europe) such as production versus (derivative) services.\n\nInstead we increased our debt. Especially during Covid. A lot of money has been printed and ended up in financial products. Now the stock markets are pumped full of air. Bitcoin is 77k. Tesla at a 130 PE.\n\nAs long as everybody keeps believing the market will not crash. But now we have Trump's erratic behavior. I expect it to be the the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. It already lowered consumer confidence & worldwide export. Personally I think some companies deserve their stock value decimated like Tesla, Palantir or Gamestop. Others should be revalued. Not everything is bad. Companies like Nvidia, Apple or BDO will still be good companies to invest in but right now everything is too overvalued.\n\nThe thing is that even right now with everything \\~15% down on average the market is still lagging behind on reality. Until we get a quarterly loss of for example Tesla, a spike in unemployment, fastly decreasing consumption and rising inflation, people will start realizing that a new economic realism has to be embraced. I think we be at least 30% lower around august.",

        "selftext": "According to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, industry giants Broadcom $AVGO and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) are reportedly in talks to carve up Intel\u2019s declining realm.\n\nIntel, once the indomitable titan of the chip-making world, has been struggling to maintain its dominance and is now considering a major division. Broadcom is eyeing Intel\u2019s chip design and marketing division, while TSMC is poised to take over Intel\u2019s manufacturing arm. This potential dismantling could align Intel with the growing industry trend where companies focus on either designing or manufacturing chips, but not both.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible to think that a company as big and important as Intel, a name synonymous with innovation and technological advancement, is now facing such a drastic fate. One day, it was the undisputed leader in the semiconductor industry, and the next day, it looks like it might be divided and taken over. The market tilt is indeed ruthless.\n\nThe discussions are still in the early stages, and no formal offers have been made yet. However, Intel\u2019s recent tribulations, including falling behind TSMC in advanced chip production and the abrupt departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger, have left it in a vulnerable position.\n\nIt's fascinating to witness how the landscape of the semiconductor industry might shift if this deal goes through. What do you all think about this potential carve-up? Do you believe it will spell the end of an era for Intel, or could this be the rebirth it desperately needs?",

        "title": "Can you explain to me, why Performance shipping is traded this low?",
        "selftext": "Alright, investors, let\u2019s talk about Performance Shipping (PSHG). This micro-cap tanker stock is trading at $1.57 (as of Feb 2025) despite a $3/share cash tender offer from Sphinx Investment Corp to acquire the remaining 90.5% of the company. The offer has been extended five times and now expires on Feb 18, 2025. \n\nMeanwhile, the company\u2019s intrinsic value is estimated at $7.60\u2013$18.23/share based on DCF models, and Wall Street analysts have a $6.63 average price target. Key Metrics:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Market cap: $19.2M vs. enterprise value: -$1.18M (yes, negative). \n\n\u2022\t\u2060P/E ratio: 0.4x vs. industry average of 4.2x. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060Price/Book: 0.07x \u2013 literally cheaper than a 2007 Aframax tanker in a scrapyard. \n\n\u2022\t\u2060Shares tendered so far: 1.7M (~14% of float).\n\nThe Bull Case:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 $3 Offer = 91% Premium: Sphinx (controlled by shipping magnate George Economou) is offering $3/share in cash. Even if you think Economou is the Gordon Gekko of Greek shipping, this is free upside if the deal closes.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Negative Enterprise Value: The company has more cash than debt. You\u2019re basically getting tankers for free.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Insider Ownership: CEO Andreas Michalopoulos and Chairwoman Aliki Paliou control ~90% of voting rights. If they\u2019re holding out for a higher bid, this could get spicy.\n\nThe Bear Case: \u2022\t\u2060Takeover Drama: Economou\u2019s offer is highly conditional, and management is fighting it like the Titanic vs. an iceberg. Lawsuits, proxy battles, and a classified board structure are delaying the inevitable. \u2022\t\u2060Low Liquidity: 12.4M shares outstanding, but insiders + institutions own ~15%. Float is tiny, so volatility goes up and down.\n\nThe Real Question: Is this a value trap or a takeover jackpot? The market hates uncertainty, but with the stock trading at 1/5th of its DCF value and a cash offer double the current price, it feels like a glitch in the Matrix.\n\nTLDR: PSHG is either the dumbest stock alive or the easiest 91% return you\u2019ll make in 2025. Either way, grab popcorn and watch the Greeks fight over tankers. \ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7\n\nMy current position: bought 7165 Shares at 1.53\u20ac",

        "title": "Outstanding Returns by Sheer Luck!",
        "selftext": "While reading investment books to get the new year started off right, I came across this gem of an anecdote:\n\n\n\nIn his book *The Smartest Portfolio You\u2019ll Ever Own*, Daniel Solin advocates for a very Bogle-y approach to investing: pick asset allocations based on risk tolerance, use index funds, and rebalance periodically. (That's a one sentence summary of the whole book. You're welcome.)\n\n\n\nHere's the interesting bit: In the chapter \"The Myth of Skill\", Solin claims that \"outstanding returns can be achieved by sheer luck.\" Definitely a talking point for index investors. To prove this he picks 10 US stock tickers based only on the letters of his last name: S-O-L-I-N; two for each letter. He claims that from January 2010 through November 2010, these 10 stocks returned 45% to the S&P's less than 6%. But what's really interesting is looking at these 10 stocks through today, 15 years later.\n\n\n\nIf Solin had invested equally in his 10 \"random\" stocks in January 2010 and then forgot about his account until this month, ***he would have 34x his money***!! Sure, this is another NVDA-go-boom story, but it's amusing because of the context of the picks and being forever immortalized in print.\n\n\n\nSo, buy index funds -- or throw some darts and hang on for the ride.\n\n\n\n|Company|Total Returns (Including Dividends)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sprint Nextel (S) \\*|732%|\n|Sirius XM Radio (SIRI)|85%|\n|Realty Income (O)|224%|\n|Oracle (ORCL)|565%|\n|Loews (L)|130%|\n|Las Vegas Sands (LVS)|294%|\n|Intel   (INTC)|49%|\n|International Business Machines (IBM)|141%|\n|NetSuite (N) \\*\\*|838%|\n|Nvidia (NVDA)|30,929%|\n|Total (Equally Weighted)|3,399%|\n\n\n\n\\* Sprint shareholders received a fixed exchange ratio of\u00a00.10256 T-Mobile shares for each Sprint share on April 1, 2020. Total Returns are based on this conversion & T-Mobile's price in Jan 2025.\n\n\n\n\\*\\* Oracle paid $109 in cash per NetSuite share in 2016; I assume this cash earned nothing after this point.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*\\* Sources: Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq.com. To be conservative, I assume he would have bought at the highest price in Jan 2010 and sold at the lowest price in Jan 2025.",

EPS in 2023 capped at $0.18.For profitability, the company reported an 81% gross margin in 2023, plus a net margin of 10%.\n\n\\^I know, that is boring shit but it matters for a buy-and-hodl deal {;)}.\n\nAfter at all that mumbo-jumbo, the big names in Wall Street research think that $PLTR is a \u2018buy-and-hold\u2019 for years to come - like I said, Motley Fool, Yahoo Finance, even [Zacks.com](http://Zacks.com), although they gave them a Zacks rating of #3 for the short-term, which means that they\u2019re likely to move in the same direction as the market.\n\nNow, with the SPX falling off a cliff in the back half of the trading day on Friday 6/28, I don\u2019t know if a 2.69 5Y Beta stock is the best place to move position into, but July historically is a month for the Bulls - maybe $PLTR is MJ.\n\nMoving right along, $PLTR closed the trading day 6/28 at $25.33 a share, after a 6.25% rise on the week, compared to $SPX\u2019s stagnancy in the same period.\n\n$PLTR has been up for inclusion on the S&P 500 since 2023, but has yet to make the cut - yet it seems to have a lot of attention.\n\nPalantir Tech barely missed earnings projections by 1.59% just a short year ago, but since then has hit the market on all the analyst\u2019s projections - their YOY earnings for the last missed projection is set to release in 36 days - this will be detrimental to the future of their shareholders.\n\nLet\u2019s size-up against the comp.  \n  \nBeing in big-tech and big-data puts you up against some big names. IBM is running the sector for data and AI innovation and Snowflake is on a popularity rise bigger than Palantir.\n\nNonetheless, $PLTR, has established secure government contracts like those of their competitors, but the business is heavily reliant on those contracts as it stands.\n\nHowever, when your business model is centered around AI, I find it hard to believe that there won\u2019t be further innovation from the company that can propel itself past the Titans o\u2019 Tech, but the Bears have faked us out with the candlesticks before.\n\nThe Bear argument is centered around the dependency on government contracts and skepticism around the security of these lump-sums of data Palantir has at their disposal.\n\nBut the way a subreddit can be protected by AI Mod bots, I\u2019m taking AI in 4 games against any hacker lol.\n\nArtificial Intelligence is an immediate advantage in today's day and age, but more and more PTOs are taking advantage of the emerging flame - the team at Palantir will have their work cut out for them, but their advanced solutions and strong government relationships give me security for a long-term hold.\n\n**The Set Up**\n\nPlain and simple - we\u2019re looking for a confirmed break over $27.45, buy, and forget my friends.\n\n[$PLTR 1D w\\/ TradingView + StocksBuddy](https://preview.redd.it/860filoy5r9d1.png?width=1558&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebf62cb44e7444e4a171ecb08a34825f05817a5c)\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see what we get out of this squad in Denver.

My research reflects a top-tier supplier of custom chips powering cloud titans like AWS and Google Cloud, and its recent $61 billion VMware acquisition just opened a fat new cash spigot with juicy profit margins. With AI and 5G still in the early innings, Broadcoms got a serious baller vibe rn.\n\nFinancially, Broadcom is a cash cow. Were talking monster gross margins at 75% and a cash-printing machine generating around $16 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Dividends are popping off, up 24% annually over five years, and the current yield at 2.3% isnt too shabby for a growth beast.\n\nOn valuation, this stock looks like a steal. Trading at \\~20x forward earnings, its way cheaper than high-flyers like NVIDIA, despite packing serious growth potential. Analysts are eyeing the $1,000+ zone for the stock in the next few years, which spells a tasty upside from here.\n\nThe risks? Regulatory heat and a macro slowdown could throw some shade, but Broadcoms diversified playbook spreads the risk nicely.\n\nTL;DR: Broadcom is a money-printing machine crushing it in semis and software. With AI, 5G, and VMware in its corner, this one\u2019s a no-brainer. Slap a $950 short-term target on it, and long-term, its got legs to hit $1,200+.\n\nThis is a strong buy imho especially with guidance into 2027!!\n\nPosition: All my savings 19 shares @ 239.40  \n(this is not financial advice it is only an analysis of Ticker AVGO)",

If rates decrease fractionally, AVGO will gain as will many other stocks which have debt (since the debt will be cheaper to finance). But if rates hold (which I'm not expecting, but it's the only likely outcome other than a small decrease), then if there's a dip - AVGO might weather it because of potential future sales. 2025 is going to be a big year for AVGO (Broadcom) now that they've identified how to tap into the AI vein. They have decades of sales experience, and have always been a \"behind-the-scenes: constantly shipping\" kind of company; a company that will essentially be selling the next-gen design of, and accessories for, the \"shovels\" in the AI boom.\n\nNot financial advice - just some musings. Disclaimer: just went all-in on them; I like them; used to test some RF modules of theirs a decade ago when I was in Regulatory RF testing.

        "title": "Thomson Reuters stock (TRI) was falsely accused of \"social deception\" by special govt. employee Elon Musk",
        "selftext": "Below is an excerpt from a news article. I'm hesitant to post any links on this story, because alot of people believe they were politically slanted when posting on a different sub.  After I explain the current news, below is a summary about TRI's present and future, dividend yield, how many consecutive raises and etc.  This is not intended to be a political post !\n\nThomson Reuters denied on Thursday accusations that the company was involved in \"large-scale social deception\" on behalf of the US government, saying the claims misrepresented its work with the Department of Defense.\n\nOn Wednesday, billionaire Elon Musk posted on X: \u201cReuters was paid millions of dollars by the US government for \u2018large scale social deception.\u2019 They\u2019re a total scam.\u201d\n\nOn Truth Social, US President Donald Trump echoed the claim, calling Reuters \u201cRadical Left\u201d and demanding that it \u201cGIVE BACK THE MONEY, NOW!\u201d\n\nThomson Reuters Special Services CEO Steve Rubley told CNN that \u201crecent public discourse\u201d has \u201cinaccurately represented the nature of the business\u201d between Thomson Reuters Special Services (TRSS) and the Department of Defense.\n\nHe added that the accusations wrongly conflated the Reuters news agency with TRSS, which are separate legal entities that operate \u201cindependently\u201d and have separate boards of directors.\n\nSo basically Thomson Reuters news agency (ticker symbol TRI) and Thomson Reuters Special Services are two separate divisions. Both are owned by parent company Thomson Reuters Corp. TRI stock did not recieve any govt money and, this issue has nothing to with them. Still TRI's stock fell 3% this past Friday. This happened after the price just rallied to all time highs, after releasing earnings on Feb 6th. I belive it's reasonable to assume that the false allegations caused the share price drop this past Friday. Though I could be wrong, and this could be a pullback or a little of both. Even now TRI stock is still up 12% in the past 30 days.\n\nThomson Ruters (TRI) stock is viewed as a boring news stock. Yet it is actually a sleeper Tech stock, and one that pays a Dividend at that. TRI just raised their dividend by 10% after lastest earnings and has a current yield of 1.38%. They have also raised their dividend for 32 consecutive years. TRI will be moving to the Nasdaq and leaving the NYSE by approximately Feb 25th. TRI is one of the more solid dividend stocks that I have never seen mentioned on this sub. They serve the Law and Tax industry with generative AI software and applications. They also happen to invest up to 200 million a year into AI via Venture Captial. One of the 23 companies they invested was an AI company, and they later bought that company.\n\nFrom this Stock Titan Article here ...\n\nhttps://www.stocktitan.net/news/TRI/thomson-reuters-announces-new-150m-corporate-venture-capital-kgryjz8tu42j.html\n\nThomson Reuters (NYSE/TSX: TRI) has announced the launch of its second Corporate Venture Capital Fund, valued at $150 million. This new fund builds upon the success of its first $100 million fund launched in 2021. Operating as Thomson Reuters Ventures, Fund 2 will target Series A investments in early-stage technology companies across Legal Technology, Tax & Accounting, Fintech, Risk Fraud & Compliance, and News & Media markets.\n\nThe first fund has already made 23 investments, including Materia, an agentic AI company that was later acquired by Thomson Reuters. The new fund will maintain a focus on financial discipline and companies developing technologies addressing professional challenges, particularly in Gen AI applications. The initiative is part of Thomson Reuters' 'Build, Partner, Buy' strategy, aiming to strengthen its leadership position in professional technology solutions.\n\nFor those of you who only hold Index funds, mutual funds, Reits and etc. you are better off ignoring this. For those of you interested in a good growing stock that pays a Dividend, you might want to take a deeper look into TRI. TRI provides you significant growth potentia (imo), and at the same time offers dividend growth with 30+ years of consecutive raises.\n\nThis not finacial advise, please do your own Due Dillgence.\n\nFull Disclosure:\n\nI hold multiple atm calls that were previously in the money.  I plan to go long and exercise.  Among these calls are one July 18, 2025 $180 strike, and two April 17, 2025 calls at $175 strike. A $195 July 18th, and  one $190 April 17th as well.  And further otm calls with one $240 July, and fourteen (got em cheap before earnings) $230 April 17 calls.\n",

I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy.\n\nI believe analysts\u2019 consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins.\n\nGoogle's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons.\n\n* It has a near monopoly in Search\n* Market leadership in media with YouTube.\n* A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.\n* A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS.\n\n**Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.**\n\nLet's take a closer look at Q3 earnings.\n\nQ3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.**\n\nRevenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%.\n\nConsolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business.\n\nGoogle Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads.\n\n**Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.**\n\nGoogle Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months.\n\nCloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more.\n\nBased on consensus analysts\u2019 estimates Alphabet\u2019s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that\u2019s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple\u2018s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google\u2019s 22. Alphabet\u2019s P/E is closer to the S&P 500\u2019s P/E of 21!\n\nI believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation.\n\nBesides the strong EPS, a lot of Google\u2019s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin.\n\nThe antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision.\n\n**I recommend Alphabet as a buy at $176**",

        "title": "Games Workshop Stock: Is Warhammer worth more than Star Wars when acquired by Disney?",
        "selftext": "This post is in relation to Games Workshop (LON: GAW), the \\~\u00a34.66 billion (\\~$5.93B USD) tabletop gaming titan behind Warhammer.\n\nMy thesis: Warhammer\u2019s universe, intellectual property (IP) and ecosystem are worth *more* than GAW\u2019s current market cap *and* what Disney paid for Star Wars in 2012 ($4.05B, or $5.54B in 2025 dollars).\n\nI know this might sound bold. One can say that Warhammer\u2019s a niche , not a mainstream beast like Star Wars was. However, as someone that's been closely monitoring latest developments of Warhammer in social media and considering an almost 50 years of lore, a rabid fanbase, and catalysts like Henry Cavill\u2019s Amazon series, this could be a sleeper hit the market\u2019s undervaluing.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down.\n\nGAW is the king of tabletop wargaming, crafting Warhammer universes\u2014*40k* (grimdark sci-fi), *Age of Sigmar* (fantasy), and *The Old World* (retro fantasy). Founded in 1975 by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone with *Owl and Weasel*\u2014a newsletter that became *White Dwarf* in 1977\u2014it\u2019s been building lore for 50 years. Today, it\u2019s a \u00a3145/share stock with:\n\n* **Market Cap**: \u00a34.66B ($5.93B).\n* **Revenue (2024)**: \u00a3577.5M ($735M), up 15.6% CAGR over 5 years.\n* **Margins**: 71% gross, 41% operating, 30% net\u2014insanely efficient.\n* **Cash**: \u00a3125.8M, net debt negative (-\u00a379.4M).\n* **P/E**: 27.1\u2014pricey, but growth justifies it.\n\nWarhammer\u2019s niche: 1-2M players dropping $200-500/year on minis, paints, and books. It\u2019s not Disney\u2019s scale, but it\u2019s a moat\u2014high-margin, loyal, and sticky.\n\n# The Thesis: Warhammer\u2019s IP is worth more than $5.9B (and Star Wars\u2019 2012 Price). GAW\u2019s $5.9B cap reflects a tabletop business, but Warhammer\u2019s IP (its lore, brand, and potential) could fetch $9-10B if sold to a Disney/Amazon/Netflix. (*)\n\n*\\[\\*Edit: I am just trying to* ***value*** *WH's IP and $GAW, not saying I want it to be sold or anything.\\]*\n\nWhy?\n\nIt\u2019s a 50-year universe with untapped multimedia juice, and it\u2019s firing on all cylinders in 2025. Let\u2019s compare:\n\n* **Disney\u2019s Star Wars Deal**: $4.05B in 2012 ($5.54B today) got Lucasfilm\u2014six films, $4.4B box office, $20B in merchandise, 35 years of lore. Disney turned it into $12B+ by 2024.\n* **Warhammer Today**: No films (yet), but $735M revenue, 50 years of history and a lore deeper than Star Wars\u201410,000 years of *40k*, Chaos Gods, Space Marines, plus *Old World* nostalgia. Licensing\u2019s just $38M\u20145% of revenue\u2014but it\u2019s a powder keg.\n\n**Valuation Math**:\n\n* Core revenue ($735M) x 8 (media IP multiple) = $5.88B.\n* Licensing upside ($500M/year from films/TV, Star Wars-scale) x 5 = $2.5B.\n* 50-year brand premium = $1-2B.\n* **Total**: $9-10B\u2014above GAW\u2019s cap and Star Wars\u2019 2012 price.\n\nCrazy? Maybe. But Warhammer\u2019s fans are deep into it. Warhammer\u2019s got potential.\n\n# Why Now? 2025 is lighting up:\n\n1. **Warhammer 40k 10th Edition**:\n   * Launched June 2023, drove 10.8% core revenue growth in 2024 ($490M). Half-year to Dec 2024: 16.4% up ($307.5M).\n   * X buzz (Q1 2025): \u201cwarhammer\" traffic\u2019s 12-15M/month, up 10-20% from Q4 2024.\n   * Potential: $75M/year growth through 2026.\n2. **Henry Cavill\u2019s Amazon Series**:\n   * Deal locked Dec 2024: Cavill stars/produces a *40k* cinematic universe.\n   * Licensing ($38M now) could double to $76M by 2027, with $40M+ indirect sales if 200K newbies buy armies.\n3. **The Old World Resurgence**:\n   * Jan 2024 launch, new faction drops (and rumours regarding Cathay).\n   * People +30 are getting back to Warhammer. Veterans spending $50-250/army per year\n4. **Hachette\u2019s Combat Patrol**:\n   * Launched Sept 2024 (UK), Jan 2025 (Spain via Salvat). Weekly mag with minis hooks newbies.\n   * Launched in US too.\n\n# Warhammer vs. Star Wars?\n\nWarhammer\u2019s no Star Wars, yet. Star Wars had mass appeal; Warhammer\u2019s a cult with 1-2M players. But:\n\n* **Lore**: 50 years, denser than Star Wars\u2019 35 in 2012. *Black Library* churns 20+ novels/year\u2014*Horus Heresy* alone is 60+ books.\n* **Fanbase**: Smaller but fanatic\u2014players co-create (painting, campaigns). Star Wars sold toys; Warhammer sells a lifestyle.\n* **Upside**: Star Wars had films in the can; Warhammer\u2019s a blank slate. Cavill\u2019s series could be its *Force Awakens*.\n\nSome say Warhammer's too niche. I say it has a potential future mass craze.\n\n$9-10B is what a buyer pays for potential, not just today\u2019s market cap.\n\n* **Now**: \u00a3145, P/E 27, 4.2% dividend yield. Fair value: \u00a3150-160 (EPS $5.35 to $6).\n* **Bull Case**: Revenue hits $850M by 2027 (Cavill, *Old World*), EPS $9, P/E 25 = \u00a3225\u201450% upside.\n* **Buyout**: A $9B bid spins the IP to Amazon, triples licensing in 5 years.\n\nRisks? Cavill flops, *Old World* fades\u2014growth slows to 5%, stock stalls at \u00a3150. But GAW\u2019s 67% ROIC and monopoly scream resilience IMO.\n\n# Thank you in advance for your feedback on my comparison of Warhammer to Star Wars.\n\nBest.",

                "body": "**BEAR CASE TO YOUR BULL CASE**\n\nRealistically, i don't see anyone buying GAW for $9-$10 billion. In terms of return on investment it doesn't make sense. Right now GAW currently has an operating income of \u00a3200/$259 million. It would take 35 years for any ROI. Say with Disney's economies of scale, that drops to 25 years? Still too much. Disny bought Star Wars for just over $4 billion and disclosed it made $12 billion by the endo of 2023. That's an ROI of 200% (about 10% CAGR). All things being equal, Star Wars had a PE of about 4 at the time of acquisition (assuming \\~$1 billion earnings per year). Even with all the new Warhammer things going on, what's their operating income in 3 years? $300? $350?\n\nYou can argue that Disney made $12 billion because of the strategy they implemented. But Warhammer is much more niche. How many people play Warhammer? 2 million? 5 million? Star Wars is one of the most popular franchises in the world. Jedi Fallen Order sold 10 million copies. The Force Awaken is the 5th highest grossing movie of all time. No way does Disney spend more money or even the same amount, on Warhammer simply because Warhammer will never generate the same amount of money anually.\n\nStar Wars \\~ $1billion/year\n\nWarhammer \\~$250million/year\n\nEven if Disney buys Warhammer at $4b market price (which it won't) they'll have to at least quadrouple the income it generates for the investment to make sense. At best, Disney buys it for $2.5 billion. As far as growing the franchise, it's risky. Disney has to invest a lot of money behind movies, games, etc. The Force Awakens cost Disney 500 million to make and generated 2 billion in sales. Is there a world where that happens for Warhammer? No way. Never. Disney won't pour half a billion into a movie that isn't a huge franchise with guaranteed sales. Disney is just too big of a company to take risks like that. Warhammer just doesn't have the same fan base and it isn't even close. It's safe to assume that Disney's investment behind the world building in Warhammer will be substantially smaller than Star Wars. Therefore Star Wars is worth much more than Warhammer.\n\n  \nAll that said, I'd be glad to be proven wrong! \ud83d\ude01",

        "title": "Intel\u2019s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk",
        "selftext": "Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever.\n\nGelsinger\u2019s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan\u2019s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself.\n\nYes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn\u2019t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses.\n\nBut ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds.\n\n\u201cThey just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,\u201d explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. \u201cSo that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s no easy path forward for the US\u2019s largest homegrown chip builder.\n\nThe Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger\u2019s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world.\n\nGelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems.\n\nLack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn\u2019t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn\u2019t ideal.\n\nGelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel\u2019s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel\u2019s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger.\n\n\u201cSome of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,\u201d said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O\u2019Donnell.\n\n\u201cGelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.\u201d\n\nNow Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger\u2019s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department\n\nUnder the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it\u2019s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can\u2019t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can\u2019t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money.\n\nBut moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult.\n\n\u201cI think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,\u201d explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. \u201cSo how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?\u201d\n\nIf Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses.\n\n\u201cYou'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,\u201d Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSo, I think you just need to scrap it.

        "title": "Why a China\u2013Korea\u2013Japan Free Trade Deal Would Be a Huge Win for BYD",
        "selftext": "TL;DR: A tri-nation FTA would give BYD cheaper access to two lucrative markets, fortify its supply chain, and encourage more partnership with top-tier Japanese and Korean firms. All that translates to faster growth and possibly fatter profits for BYD. It\u2019s the kind of macro tailwind that could make BYD\u2019s ambitious global goals (like that 800k overseas sales target) even more achievable. As a BYD enthusiast, I\u2019d be very excited to see this free trade deal happen \u2013 it could be a sleeper catalyst for BYD\u2019s stock in the long run.\n\n So let's talk BYD and free trade. Imagine China, South Korea, and Japan sign a free trade agreement (FTA) \u2013 no tariffs, smoother trade, tighter supply chains. As a long-time BYD watcher, I genuinely think BYD would love this scenario. Here\u2019s my take on why BYD could be one of the biggest beneficiaries:\n\nMore BYDs on Korean and Japanese Roads\n\nImproved export access = more sales. BYD has been aggressively expanding into both Japan and South Korea, and an FTA would throw the doors wide open. In Japan, BYD only entered in 2023 and sold 2,223 EVs in 2024 \u2013 surprisingly surpassing Toyota\u2019s EV sales (2,038 units) in their own home market\u200b. That\u2019s a tiny fraction of Japan\u2019s ~4 million annual auto sales, but it shows BYD\u2019s potential. They\u2019re so bullish that they plan to open 100 dealerships in Japan by 2025\u200b. Now, picture those BYD showrooms if exports face zero trade barriers. Japanese EV adoption is just getting started (EVs were <2% of Japan\u2019s auto sales in 2024\u200b), so easier access could let BYD ride the coming wave as Japan catches up on electrification.\n\nIn South Korea, BYD is also making moves. They just launched models like the Dolphin hatchback (aka Atto 3) and Seal sedan in early 2025 with aggressive pricing (around $21k) aimed at undercutting Hyundai and Kia\u200b. BYD literally said they\u2019re in Korea \u201cfor the long haul\u201d and will start with affordable EVs to gain a foothold\u200b chosun.comThe Korean EV market is growing (about 99,000 EVs sold in 2024, ~6% of total car sales\u200b), and Korean consumers have shown they\u2019ll buy foreign EVs if the deal is good \u2013 Tesla\u2019s sales in Korea jumped 548% last year to nearly 30k units wants a piece of that action, and a tri-nation FTA would only accelerate this. With freer trade, exporting more vehicles into Korea and Japan becomes simpler and cheaper, allowing BYD to scale up dealerships and marketing without so much red tape.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget BYD\u2019s broader global push: the company is already on fire overseas. In the first quarter of 2025, BYD\u2019s overseas sales doubled, topping 206,000 NEVs (EVs + plug-in hybrids) sold outside China through March\u200b. They\u2019re aiming for 800,000 overseas sales in 2025, roughly double 2024\u2019s level\u200b. Gaining frictionless access to nearby wealthy markets like Japan and Korea could add significant volume on top of BYD\u2019s growth in Europe, Latin America, etc. It\u2019s basically low-hanging fruit next door. As one Reuters analysis noted, BYD sees \u201cgreat opportunities\u201d in markets friendly to Chinese EVs\u200b \u2013 and an FTA would make Japan/Korea way more friendly by default.\n\nTariff-Free = Cheaper EVs (or Better Margins)\n\nOne immediate benefit of a free trade pact would be zero tariffs on cars and batteries moving between the three countries. This is huge for BYD. Right now, importing cars into South Korea incurs an 8% tariff, which BYD has even been absorbing itself to keep prices low\u200b (Talk about commitment \u2013 BYD literally ate the 8% tax just so Korean buyers wouldn\u2019t feel it, making their EVs more competitively priced!). If a China-Korea FTA scrapped that duty, BYD could either drop prices further (boosting demand) or stop sacrificing that 8% off their margins. Either way, BYD wins.\n\nIn Japan, auto import tariffs are already pretty low (Japan has prided itself on open auto markets in terms of tariffs\u200b). But an FTA would lock in zero tariffs on EVs and also likely cut duties on EV components. Think about batteries, for example. BYD not only makes cars but is a major battery producer; under free trade, shipping BYD\u2019s batteries or battery cells to partners in Japan/Korea would be cheaper. Likewise, any high-tech parts BYD imports from Japan/Korea for its cars (semiconductors, camera systems, etc.) would drop in cost. It\u2019s a supply chain cost advantage on both ends.\n\nCrucially, a tri-country FTA would shield BYD from the kind of tariff threats popping up in the West. Europe has been mulling tariffs on Chinese EVs, and the U.S. has been generally hostile with trade barriers. BYD\u2019s chairman has openly discussed how tariffs abroad are a concern and said BYD might respond by assembling cars locally to \u201covercome tariffs\u201d in those regions\u200b. But if China, Japan, and Korea are freely trading, BYD doesn\u2019t need costly local factories or workarounds for those markets \u2013 they can ship finished cars directly. No 10% EU tariff equivalent, no Trump-style surprises. Just sell the car and bank the revenue. This kind of stable, tariff-free access would make Japan and Korea very attractive markets for BYD to focus on, since their cost advantage would fully translate to showroom prices. One Bloomberg piece even noted BYD\u2019s $21k starting price in Korea undercuts local EVs by being so low\u200b\u2013 remove tariffs and BYD could sustain such aggressive pricing more profitably.\n\nBottom line: lower tariffs = lower prices = more competitive BYD EVs. Given BYD\u2019s strength is value-for-money, an FTA turbocharges that advantage in Japan and Korea.\n\nStronger East Asian EV Supply Chains\n\nBYD isn\u2019t just a carmaker; they\u2019re an integrated EV supply chain beast (batteries, electronics, you name it). A free trade agreement would knit China, Japan, and South Korea\u2019s industries closer, which plays right into BYD\u2019s hands. These three countries combined account for nearly 40% of global manufacturing output, including dominating sectors like semiconductors, EVs, and batteries\u200b. In other words, East Asia is already the powerhouse of the EV world \u2013 and BYD is a major player in that powerhouse. If trade barriers drop, it becomes a lot easier to source the best components regionally and optimize costs.\n\nFor instance, Japan and South Korea are leaders in certain EV components: think of Japan\u2019s electronics (chips from Renesas, sensors from Denso) or Korea\u2019s advanced battery materials and displays. Under an FTA, BYD could import high-tech parts from Japanese and Korean suppliers tariff-free and likely faster. That means BYD\u2019s cars can benefit from top-notch components at lower cost. Similarly, BYD could export its own components to partners in those countries. Perhaps Japanese automakers might buy BYD\u2019s affordable batteries (BYD\u2019s blade battery tech is world-class), or Korean firms could source BYD\u2019s EV semiconductors or motors. With fewer trade frictions, a more efficient regional EV supply chain forms, and BYD can slot right into it as both supplier and assembler.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing hints of such collaboration. All three governments have talked about strengthening supply chain cooperation in high-tech sectors as part of improving trilateral trade ties\u200b. For example, South Korea and Japan want reliable access to China\u2019s rare earths and battery materials, while China wants chips from Japan/Korea\u200b. EVs benefit directly from this kind of exchange: BYD needs advanced chips (which Japan/Korea excel at), and Japanese/Korean automakers need battery tech (which BYD offers). A freer trade environment makes these exchanges smoother and less politically fraught.\n\nOne likely focus area is EV battery supply chains. Batteries often have materials crisscrossing borders (lithium processed in China, cells made in Korea, etc.). With an FTA, these materials and parts could move across China, Japan, and Korea with minimal hassle, lowering the cost to build each battery pack. BYD\u2019s cars \u2013 and also its battery sales to other OEMs \u2013 would get a cost edge from that. In a sense, the FTA could encourage a regional EV \u201cecosystem\u201d where each country specializes a bit (China mass-produces, Japan provides precision components, Korea contributes tech and refinement) to collectively take on Western competitors. BYD, given its scale and vertical integration, would be in a prime spot to orchestrate and benefit from this synergy.\n\nTech Partnerships & Investments: BYD + Japan/Korea = \ud83d\udc95\n\nPerhaps the most exciting (and underrated) benefit: a free trade deal would likely foster more tech collaboration and cross-investment between companies in China, Japan, and Korea \u2013 which could hugely aid BYD. Free trade isn\u2019t just about goods; it builds trust and business ties. And when borders are more open, big players tend to team up rather than reinvent the wheel.\n\nBYD\u2019s already got notable friends in Japan/Korea. Case in point: Toyota. The Japanese giant struck a joint venture with BYD to co-develop electric cars, pooling their R&D talent. Engineers from both companies are literally working under one roof to \u201cdevelop BEVs that are superior in performance... by merging the two companies\u2019 strengths,\u201d as the JV\u2019s CEO put it\u200b. This kind of partnership was once unthinkable \u2013 a top Japanese automaker relying on a Chinese firm\u2019s EV tech \u2013 but BYD\u2019s expertise (especially in batteries) made it happen. An FTA would likely encourage more partnerships like Toyota-BYD, by assuring Japanese and Korean firms that cooperation with Chinese companies is a safe, long-term bet (no sudden trade wars to wreck the venture). We could envision, say, Honda or Nissan collaborating with BYD on battery supply, or Korean firms like Samsung expanding their investment in BYD.\n\nSpeaking of Samsung \u2013 they actually invested $450 million in BYD a few years back\u200b, taking a small stake to cooperate on electric car chips and batteries. That\u2019s a Korean electronics titan effectively betting on BYD\u2019s auto future. Similarly, there are reports of other tech exchanges (for example, rumors that BYD might supply batteries to certain Japanese EV projects, etc.). If China/Japan/Korea enter a free trade framework, it lowers the political risk of such deals and likely removes caps or hassles on cross-border investments. BYD could more easily attract capital or partnerships from say, a SoftBank or a Hyundai Mobis, who might want exposure to its EV battery business or its fast-growing EV lineup.\n\nFor BYD, more collaboration means faster innovation and market penetration. Partnering with established Japanese and Korean players can help BYD improve its tech (imagine BYD using Sony sensors or Samsung displays in its cars seamlessly) and also gain local market insights. It\u2019s a two-way street: those partners get BYD\u2019s cost-efficient tech, and BYD gains credibility and technical refinement. A trade deal acting as a green light for such tie-ups is a big strategic win for BYD\u2019s long-term growth. As a cherry on top, freer investment flows might even allow BYD to set up joint factories or R&D centers in Japan/Korea down the line, further ingraining them in those markets (and creating jobs there, which governments love).\n\nThe Long-Term Growth Boost\n\nTie it all together, and BYD stands to gain on multiple fronts: more sales opportunities, lower costs, stronger tech, and bigger allies. In a business as globally competitive as electric vehicles, those advantages can be game-changing. BYD is already the world\u2019s largest EV maker by volume, and it\u2019s hungry for global market share. A China-Korea-Japan FTA would effectively hand BYD a \u201chome field\u201d advantage across East Asia \u2013 a region with huge car markets and tech resources. It\u2019s no surprise analysts are buzzing about East Asian economic cooperation. These three countries combined are an economic juggernaut (quarter of global GDP) with massive auto industry clout\u200b.\n\nIf they tear down trade barriers among themselves, companies like BYD that can integrate across borders will be in pole position.\n\nFrom an investor\u2019s perspective, this kind of free trade pact would make the bull case for BYD\u2019s international expansion even stronger. It de-risks their Asia expansion and could add a few percentage points to profit margins on each car sold in Japan/Korea (thanks to tariff removal and supply chain efficiencies). It also signals that major governments in the region are supportive of EV industry growth via cooperation, not protectionism \u2013 which bodes well for BYD not getting shut out. Remember, a rising tide lifts all boats: BYD\u2019s success in Japan and Korea could also positively pressure local rivals to step up, expanding the overall EV market pie (which BYD gets a slice of).",

They\u2019ve got their own national champions\u2014Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Kia\u2014with deep political connections and heavy domestic lobbying power. Think those guys are going to roll out the red carpet for BYD to eat their lunch? Not a chance. A full-blown FTA would have to survive that resistance, and even if it passed, don\u2019t underestimate how non-tariff barriers (regulations, inspections, local content rules) can still be used to slow down foreign competition.\n\nSecond, the idea that a free trade deal would \u201clock in\u201d friendly market access is\u2026optimistic. Trade deals can be revised, paused, or sidestepped when politics shift (ask the UK how stable these things are). And with geopolitical tensions constantly simmering\u2014China\u2019s stance on Taiwan, South Korea\u2019s alliance with the U.S., Japan\u2019s own security concerns\u2014this kind of deep economic integration isn\u2019t exactly frictionless. If Beijing sneezes the wrong way, Seoul and Tokyo might catch a cold and slam the brakes on cooperation.\n\nThird, BYD\u2019s success abroad isn\u2019t just about tariffs\u2014it\u2019s about perception. Japanese and Korean consumers are notoriously brand-loyal and skeptical of foreign newcomers, especially from China. Even with a cost advantage, BYD still faces uphill battles in trust, branding, and service infrastructure. Tesla barely cracked those markets\u2014and that\u2019s Tesla. BYD isn\u2019t just going to steamroll in because of a few percentage points of tariff relief.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real: the FTA dream is years away if it ever happens. These countries have been talking about a trilateral deal for over a decade with little progress. The economic benefits are clear, but the political will? Not so much.\n\nSo yeah, BYD could benefit in theory. But betting on a free trade agreement like this as a major catalyst is kind of like counting your chickens before the diplomats even sit down. Good macro narrative for the bulls, but a long way from guaranteed upside.",

        "selftext": "Alibaba has completed a three-year regulatory \u201crectification\u201d process following an antitrust fine it received on charges of monopolistic practices in 2021, China\u2019s market regulator said on Friday.\n\nShares of Alibaba rose more than 3% in Friday morning trading.\n\nOn Friday, China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said that, over the past few years, it has been supervising Alibaba\u2019s process to become compliant with antitrust regulations. The rectification work has achieved \u201cgood results,\u201d the SAMR said, according to a Google-translated statement.\n\nIn 2021, China\u2019s SAMR fined Alibaba 18.23 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) as part of an anti-monopoly investigation into the tech giant. The regulator\u2019s focus was on a practice that forces merchants to choose one of two e-commerce platforms, rather than being able to work with both.\n\nAt the time, the regulator said that the \u201cchoose one\u201d policy and others allowed Alibaba to bolster its position in the market and gain unfair competitive advantages.\n\nSince that fine, the SAMR has been supervising Alibaba as it gets in line with the regulator\u2019s requirements. Alibaba has now completed this process and has stopped the \u201d\u2018choose one of two\u2019 monopoly behavior,\u201d the SAMR said Friday.\n\nThe SAMR said it will now guide Alibaba to continue to improve its compliance and efficiency and to accelerate innovation.\n\nThe conclusion of the regulatory overhaul will help put one of Alibaba\u2019s worst run-ins with Beijing behind it. Jefferies analysts said in a note on Friday that the conclusion of the regulatory process was a \u201cpositive\u201d for the company, which \u201chighlights this is a new start and ensures compliance in operations.\u201d\n\nBut the regulator\u2019s announcement could also signal the ongoing softening stance from Chinese regulators towards private technology firms, following an intense crackdown that began at the end of 2020. At the time, Beijing enacted several regulations and moves that aimed to restrict the power of domestic technology firms in areas ranging from antitrust to gaming.\n\nThe empire of Alibaba founder Jack Ma has been in the spotlight over the past few years since regulators axed the IPO of his financial technology firm Ant Group in 2020. Ant Group itself also underwent a regulator-supervised rectification process, with most of the major issues resolved by last year.\n\nRegulatory concerns have been an overhang on the Alibaba stock, which has fallen more than 70% from its peak in 2020. More recently, the company has been dealing with slow growth amid rising competition in the e-commerce space in China, as well as contending with a cautious Chinese consumer.\n\nThe tech titan showed early signs of a recovery in the June quarter, as cloud computing revenue reaccelerated and transactions via its e-commerce platforms looked healthy.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/alibaba-shares-jump-as-it-completes-three-year-regulatory-overhau.html",

It can designate large companies that have a significant amount of market power in a certain digital activity as having \u201cstrategic market status.\u201d\n\nThe CMA now has the power to impose changes to prevent potential anti-competitive behavior from any firm that is given strategic market status.\n\nAccording to the regulator, virtually all mobile devices sold in the U.K. are pre-installed with either Apple\u2019s iOS or Google\u2019s Android operating systems, and their app stores and browsers have either exclusive or leading positions on their platforms compare to alternative products and services.\n\nAlmost all (94%) of people aged 16 or above \u2014 about 56 million consumers \u2014 in the U.K. currently have access to a smartphone and the average Brit spends around three hours a day using a mobile device, the CMA added.\n\nThe body said it would examine three key issues, including the extent of competition between Apple and Google\u2019s mobile ecosystems, possible leveraging of the tech giants\u2019 market power into other activities and potential exploitative conduct.\n\n\u201cMore competitive mobile ecosystems could foster new innovations and new opportunities across a range of services that millions of people use, be they app stores, browsers or operating systems,\u201d Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA, said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\u201cBetter competition could also boost growth here in the UK, with businesses able to offer new and innovative types of products and services on Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s platforms,\u201d Cardell added.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/23/apple-and-google-hit-with-uk-antitrust-probe-into-mobile-ecosystems.html",

                "body": "A couple reasons:\n\n1. Software is significantly more scalable without much rise in costs. Data centers and servers do not cost that much to operate, but are both high profit margin for the companies that host them as well as the companies that use them to host software, since software is much easier to scale. It's a lot easier to sell an iphone app to hundreds of thousands or even millions of users then it is to sell a physical product to hundreds of thousands or millions of buyers.\n\n2. Most of the major innovations going forward will almost be guaranteed to come from tech. Tech is also used everywhere - software makes manufacturing more efficient, it makes education more efficient, it makes healthcare more efficient, it makes entertainment more accessible, it makes defense more resilient, etc. \n\n3. Tech is not ever really moving backwards. We're not about to abandon cars in favor of horses. We're not about to abandon computers in favor of abacus'. We're certainly not about to abandon software in return for doing calculations by hand. Tech continuously will always keep building upon previous foundations. Not having to reinvent the computer means we can invent AI. Eventually not having to reinvent AI means we can invent AGI, and it will only ever move forward as new inventions are made.\n\nNow that's not to say that we can't invent useless apps. Toothbrushes that have AI that tell you where you missed in your mouth is probably not a product that is really necessary. Having an app for literally everything is probably not ideal. But the real innovations in the world will be tech-adjacent in some way. Pharmaceutical companies that invent new medicines are using technology to do so. Mathematicians and scientists that discover new theorems or proofs are using computers to help them even if the computer themselves aren't doing the main intelligent thinking.",

        "title": "SoftBank stock hits its first record high in 24 years \u2014 Arm and AI helped it get there  ",
        "selftext": "SoftBank Group shares hit a record high on Thursday, just as the company\u2019s massive tech investment arm shows signs of recovery and its outspoken founder Masayoshi Son emerged back into the public spotlight to align the Japanese giant to a future in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe firm has also been helped by the public market success of British chip designer Arm, in which Softbank has a majority stake.\n\nShares of the Japanese giant closed at a record high of 11,190.00 Japanese yen on Thursday \u2014 a far cry from the dotcom crash of the early 2000s and a more recent downturn for the company during the tech market troubles of 2021 and 2022.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s journey to the peak\n\nSon founded SoftBank in 1981, back when the company distributed software. It went public in Japan in 1994, and, amid the internet boom, made a $2 million investment in Yahoo in the middle of that decade.\n\nThat started off the company\u2019s tech investments.\n\nThe rise of the internet and of Yahoo pushed SoftBank\u2019s stock to a peak closing price of 10,111.1 yen on Feb. 18, 2000. Three days prior, the firm\u2019s shares had hit an intraday high of 11,000 yen.\n\nAs internet stocks came crashing down, so too did SoftBank\u2019s share price, which at one point sank more than 90% below its dotcom peak.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until nearly 21 years later, on Feb. 16, 2021, that SoftBank exceeded its previous record-high close.\n\nVision Fund\n\nThe recent rise to a share price peak has been volatile since Son positioned SoftBank as a visionary pioneer with the 2017 launch of a massive technology investment arm \u2014 the Vision Fund.\n\nSoftBank made dozens of bets on tech companies across the world, some of which turned sour. Office sharing startup WeWork was perhaps among the highest-profile names. But some of SoftBank\u2019s investments in Chinese firms also took a hit after Beijing kicked off its crackdown on the domestic tech sector at the end of 2020.\n\nAfter lingering near then-record highs in March 2021, SoftBank\u2019s stock fell sharply, alongside other global tech stocks. The Vision Fund posted then-record financial losses in 2022. Son said that SoftBank would go into \u201cdefense\u201d mode and be more conservative with its investments. He changed tack shortly after the Vision Fund posted a record $32 billion loss in 2023, saying that the company would now shift into \u201coffense,\u201d because he was excited about the investment opportunities in AI.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s share price began a recovery from around May 2023, and the Japanese titan\u2019s Vision Fund more recently posted better financials amid broader tech stock recoveries.\n\n\u201cSoftbank Vision Fund had to write down various investments due to a combination of equity values declining and a tougher private financing environment. It looks like the write down cycle is mostly done, and there is a good chance that the IPO market will be more constructive going forward, especially for AI related investments,\u201d Oliver Matthew, head of Asian consumer research at CLSA, told CNBC by email.\n\nArm chip boost\n\nSeveral analysts attributed SoftBank\u2019s recent share price bump of around 78% in the year to date to the IPO success of Arm, which it acquired in 2016.\n\nSoftBank owns roughly 90% of Arm even after the listing. Arm shares are up nearly 124% alone this year, as of the close on July 3.\n\n\u201cSoftBank Group\u2019s investment strategy and focus has long included the development of an AI ecosystem portfolio, long before the LLM (large language model)-driven bull cycle in AI-related names over the last 18 months or so,\u201d Paul Golding, senior U.S. lifestyle and payments analyst at Macquarie U.S. equity research, told CNBC by email.\n\n\u201cThis vision, in our view, likely drove some of the investment decision in 2016 to acquire Arm, giving SoftBank Group direct exposure to semiconductor market dynamics and ownership of intellectual property around semiconductor design well ahead of broader progress in AI use-cases and platforms.\u201d\n\nSoftBank shares \u201chave been benefitting from this vis-\u00e0-vis well-publicized\u201d uses for Arm intellectual property, such as in the automotive industry or cloud data center, Golding added.\n\nDo investors believe the SoftBank story?\n\nOver the years, investors have focused on whether SoftBank Group\u2019s valuation fairly reflects the assets it is invested in or holds.\n\nFor example, SoftBank\u2019s valuation is around $101.5 billion. Arm\u2019s market capitalization is around $176 billion \u2014 meaning that SoftBank\u2019s 90% stake is equivalent to about $158 billion of that figure. That alone is significantly above SoftBank Group\u2019s overall valuation, without taking into account the company\u2019s other holdings and businesses, such as its telecommunications arm.\n\nAnalysts cite this as a reason why SoftBank\u2019s share price does not reflect its fair value.\n\nDan Baker, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said a lot of SoftBank\u2019s price appreciation comes down to Arm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that investors are convinced by the SoftBank story again,\u201d Baker told CNBC by email, adding that this year\u2019s share gain is \u201cprimarily\u201d because Arm stock has risen, while the Japanese yen has weakened. Baker said it is worth looking at the so-called sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation, which ascribes value to the various parts of SoftBank\u2019s holdings to figure what the company is worth. Baker said the SOTP valuation remains just under 50% this year, meaning SoftBank\u2019s stock does not truly reflect the value of its various businesses and investments.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m not sure that investors are \u2018buying the SoftBank story\u2019 but investors are certainly buying the ARM story,\u201d Baker said.\n\nInvestors have also cheered the fact that SoftBank has sold practically all of its shares in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant that Son backed in 2000.\n\nSoftBank has also likely been helped by a recent broader rise in Japanese stocks, with the Nikkei 225 Index up 22% this year alone as of Thursday.\n\nArtificial super intelligence\n\nBut can Son\u2019s focus on AI boost SoftBank\u2019s value further and close the discount to its basket of assets?\n\nThe SoftBank founder, who has been out of the public spotlight in the last year, recently spoke about his excitement over the future of AI and how SoftBank can be at the center of this technology with its investment in companies like Arm.\n\nSon last month laid out his vision for a world featuring what he dubbed as artificial super intelligence, or ASI, which would be 10,000 times smarter than humans.\n\nIt comes at a time when investors are feverishly looking at how to play the AI boom, with the parabolic rise of Nvidia\u2019s stock price underscoring the excitement around the technology.\n\nCLSA\u2019s Matthew said SoftBank\u2019s discount could reduce, going forward, thanks to some of the company\u2019s early AI investments.\n\n\u201cSoftbank has been absolutely consistent about its investment direction; they were among the earliest investors behind the AI theme, and in some ways too early so many investors thought they were overpaying, or buying into certain companies where it wasn\u2019t clear how AI was related,\u201d Matthew said.\n\n\u201cAs a result, Softbank Group shares trade at a surprisingly wide discount to its fair value, and we believe this discount will narrow in the future.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/04/softbank-shares-hit-record-high-after-24-years-on-arm-and-ai-boost.html",

You\u2019re on the /r/Stocks subreddit, if you see no value in picking individual stocks, you\u2019re in the wrong place.\u00a0 2. The purpose of buybacks are generally not to cash in on a low valuation, but a tool to redistribute profits. In the case of SoftBank, the potential profits are not yet realized, hence the speculation portion of the post.\u00a0 3. Nvidia is not the only listed company with \u201cpricing power\u201d. It\u2019s an odd comparison but let\u2019s consider it. ARM currently holds a near monopoly of commercial processor architecture with no competition in sight, while nvidia has a current market lead in its own field but with wealthy potential competitors edging closer each day. In my view, based on current offerings and competitors, ARM is more likely to retain their monopoly in the long run, and is much less reliant on the success of AI",

        "selftext": "I was researching the difference between total outstanding shares vs float, and apparently most companies do not exclude instituional shares from float because they are traded on exchanges as well. My example is Apple, which despite having 57.59% institutionally owned shares its float is 15.31b of its 15.33b shares. What I don\u2019t understand, however, is how it says 5.22% of shares are owned by insiders, which I thought was not included in public float calculation. However the float is 99.8%, not 94.78% or whatever; so clearly at least the vast majority of these shares are counted. Is it only certain restricted shares that are not counted? Also the only article I could really find on this on titan.com said some companies calculate institutional shares as part of public float, some don\u2019t. Are there any examples of some that don\u2019t?
