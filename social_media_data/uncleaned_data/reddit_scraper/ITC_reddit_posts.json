By that logic, ITC Ltd shares market price post demerger should have been approx 424. And the shares of ITC Hotels Ltd. should've traded at approx 662 post merger.\n\nOn the contrary, the ITC hotels shares are hitting lower circuits below 170 also. What is going on? Have I done some mistake in calculating anything?",

                "body": "It\u2019s first stage of a demerger framework.\n\nThe Demerger Framework.\n\n**Major reasons why companies pursue Demerger and how to benefit from them**\n\n* **To unlock hidden value that is otherwise not recognised** by the market when the company is viewed as a conglomerate.**(ITC\u2019s hotel business has been overshadowed by the company\u2019s larger FMCG and paperboard businesses. By demerging the hotel business, ITC will allow the market to re-evaluate the value of this segment independently.This could lead to the hotel business being undervalued at first, because institutional investors who are focused on FMCG or other sectors may sell off the stock.)**\n* **The parent company can  better allocate capital to its most profitable segments**, improving its overall capital efficiency and profitability.\\*\\*(\\*\\*After the hotel business is demerged, ITC will be able to focus more on its FMCG,Smoke, paperboard, and packaging segments, which are  higher-margin and less capital-intensive compared to the hotel business.**This could allow ITC to allocate capital more efficiently and potentially increase the profitability of its remaining divisions**.)\n* By spinning off a business, both the **parent company and the new company can focus on what they do best**.When a business is freed from large corporate parent, entrepreneurial forces are unleashed in the new division .This can lead to better performance and greater growth potential for both businesses.\n* To appeal to a more specific group of investors.The parent company may attract investors interested in more mature, stable businesses, while the spinoff may attract those looking for faster growth or higher risk.\n* **Tax, antitrust, regulatory Issue(ITC demerger is not not based on this)**\n\n**You don\u2019t need special formulas or mathematical models to make money from spinoff. You just need to exploit the fundamental issues.**\n\n**Two Critical Elements of this Framework .**\n\n\\- I**nstitutions dont want the spinoff  and  Insider want the spinoff.**\n\n**Institutions don\u2019t want the spinoff and reduce stake in new company** (They have structural reasons for that and it has nothing to do with the companies fundamentals)\n\n* Spinoff companies are much smaller than parent companies, this makes the size of new business too small for an institutional portfolio, which only contain companies with much larger market capitalisations.\n* Many funds(Large cap funds, index funds and etf) can only own shares of companies included in Nifty and Sensex. **So the new division will be subject to huge amount of indiscriminate selling.This gives us the opportunity to pick up shares as a lower price after the spinoff.**\n* **Acc to Penn State Study, the largest stock gains for spinoff company comes not in the first year but 2nd year. It may take a full year or 15-20% decline for the initial selling pressure to wear off before the spinoff stock can perform at its best(This is a 30 year study that was focused only on spinoffs)**\n\n**Insiders want the spinoff and have stake in the new company** (This reflect that the parent company believes that their will be growth and value creation for them in this new company, in several cases parent company  don\u2019t hold any stake in the spinoff company which is a big red flag)\n\n* **ITC will maintain a 40% ownership of ITC Hotels, with ITC shareholders acquiring the remaining 60% in proportion to their stake in the parent entity)So the second condition is already fulfilled.**\n\nSo with a bit of logic, common sense and experience we can exploit the situation and make money. Its has already declared that ITC will have 40% stake and now if the selling happens by institutions in first few months, both the criteria will be fulfilled and it will be an opportunity to allocate some capital.\n\nI **have used this strategy on Danaher spinoff of Verlato in 2023 and it worked. The stock got listed on $84 went to $68in next few months AND currently trading at $102.**\n\n**Same is happening with Raymond spin off right now** although I haven\u2019t checked whether Raymond has insider stake in Raymond lisfestyle.\n\nSo have Patience and Wait and see whether the stock is following similar pattern and **apply it only for spinoffs from high quality company which have good management.**\n\nIt\u2019s a bit complicated framework which I have tired to explain in a more simplified version, I hope you find it valuable.\n\nIf anyone wants to go into details of this framework ,you can **read chapter 3 of Joel Greenblatt book \u201cYou Can Be A Stock Market genius.\u201d**\n\nr/IndiaGrowthStocks.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI received an email that my Demat account is credited with ITC Hotel shares with the mention of the date. However, I haven't received those in my demat account. My demat is with SBI Securities. Will there be a delay? Is this normal? Has anyone had the shares reflected in their account?  It says that the listing and trading permission is needed by NSE & BSE. So, is it frozen and that's why not reflecting?  \n\nTried googling but a lot of contradiction across websites. Anybody knows about this and what should be done? Please let me know. \n\n*UPDATE*: Actually, from yesterday, I am seeing those shares reflecting in the account! I guess it just took some time. ",

Now I have both ITC as well as Icici FMCG ETF ( ITC weight 27% HUL weight 16% rest are 0.5-1% each ). What do you think will be optimal to keep logically ? \n\nMy Analysis : ETF has high weightage in ITC already , and individual stock performs better relative to ETF in most case, since I have good risk tolerance , it would be better to keep ITC and use capital allocated to ETF somewhere. \n\nBoth are in green so selling won't be an issue , I am looking for long term (4-5 yrs) so no problem with recent sell offs.

        "selftext": "\"A month ago, I laid out a framework for ITC\u2019s demerger. Now, as events play out exactly as expected, those who missed it can look back, reassess, and align their investments accordingly.\"\n\nThe stock has already corrected 15%, making it a good point to allocate 30% of your planned investment.For every additional 5% drop, allocate another 10%. This way, you\u2019ll build your position in a structured, disciplined manner. For example, if you plan to invest 1 lakh in the stock, start by allocating 30K and build your position gradually.\n\n# The Demerger Framework and How To Apply it on ITC.\u00a0\n\n# This Investing strategy has generated a\u00a030.8%compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over 17 years for Joel Greenblatt.\n\n* (Index S&P 500 gave a CAGR of 9.5% during that period)\n\nIt was Designed by\u00a0**Joel Greenblatt**\u00a0and mentioned in his book\u00a0**\"You Can Be A Stock Market Genius\"**\u00a0\n\nThe Demerger Framework.\n\n**Major reasons why companies pursue Demerger and how to benefit from them**\n\n* **To unlock hidden value that is otherwise not recognised**\u00a0by the market when the company is viewed as a conglomerate.**(ITC\u2019s hotel business has been overshadowed by the company\u2019s larger FMCG and paperboard businesses. By demerging the hotel business, ITC will allow the market to re-evaluate the value of this segment independently.This could lead to the hotel business being undervalued at first, because institutional investors who are focused on FMCG or other sectors may sell off the stock.)**\n* **The parent company can better allocate capital to its most profitable segments**, improving its overall capital efficiency and profitability.\\*\\*(\\*\\*After the hotel business is demerged, ITC will be able to focus more on its FMCG,Smoke, paperboard, and packaging segments, which are higher-margin and less capital-intensive compared to the hotel business.**This could allow ITC to allocate capital more efficiently and potentially increase the profitability of its remaining divisions**.)\n* By spinning off a business, both the\u00a0**parent company and the new company can focus on what they do best**.When a business is freed from large corporate parent, entrepreneurial forces are unleashed in the new division .This can lead to better performance and greater growth potential for both businesses.\n* To appeal to a more specific group of investors.The parent company may attract investors interested in more mature, stable businesses, while the spinoff may attract those looking for faster growth or higher risk.\n* **Tax, antitrust, regulatory Issue(ITC demerger is not not based on this)**\n\n**You don't need special formulas or mathematical models to make money from spinoff. You just need to exploit the fundamental issues.**\n\n**Two Critical Elements of this Framework .**\n\n\\- I**nstitutions dont want the spinoff and Insider want the spinoff.**\n\n**Institutions don't want the spinoff and reduce stake in new company**\u00a0(They have structural reasons for that and it has nothing to do with the companies fundamentals)\n\n* Spinoff companies are much smaller than parent companies, this makes the size of new business too small for an institutional portfolio, which only contain companies with much larger market capitalisations.\n* Many funds(Large cap funds, index funds and etf) can only own shares of companies included in Nifty and Sensex.\u00a0**So the new division will be subject to huge amount of indiscriminate selling.This gives us the opportunity to pick up shares as a lower price after the spinoff.**\n* **Acc to Penn State Study, the largest stock gains for spinoff company comes not in the first year but 2nd year. It may take a full year or 15-20% decline for the initial selling pressure to wear off before the spinoff stock can perform at its best(This is a 30 year study that was focused only on spinoffs)**\n\n**Insiders want the spinoff and have stake in the new company**\u00a0(This reflect that the parent company believes that their will be growth and value creation for them in this new company, in several cases parent company don't hold any stake in the spinoff company which is a big red flag)\n\n* **ITC will maintain a 40% ownership of ITC Hotels, with ITC shareholders acquiring the remaining 60% in proportion to their stake in the parent entity)So the second condition is already fulfilled.**\n\nSo with a bit of logic, common sense and experience we can exploit the situation and make money. Its has already declared that ITC will have 40% stake and now if the selling happens by institutions in first few months, both the criteria will be fulfilled and it will be an opportunity to allocate some capital.\n\nI\u00a0**have used this strategy on Danaher spinoff of Verlato in 2023 and it worked. The stock got listed on $84 went to $68in next few months AND currently trading at $102.**\n\n**Same is happening with Raymond spin off right now**\u00a0although I haven't checked whether Raymond has insider stake in Raymond lisfestyle.\n\nSo have Patience and Wait and see whether the stock is following similar pattern and\u00a0**apply it only for spinoffs from high quality company which have good management.**\n\nIt's a bit complicated framework which I have tired to explain in a more simplified version, I hope you find it valuable.\n\nIf anyone wants to go into details of this framework ,you can\u00a0**read chapter 3 of Joel Greenblatt book \"You Can Be A Stock Market genius.\"**\n\nHappy Investing!\nFor more investment strategies and breakdowns look into Indiagrowthstocks.

        "selftext": "Investing in large-cap companies like Reliance, Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and ITC may not yield multibagger returns. For significant gains, consider small-cap, micro-cap, and select mid-cap stocks. Let\u2019s explore why and how these investments can be more rewarding.\n\nHow Does a Stock Become a Multibagger?\nLow Price and Low Market Capitalization (Mcap):\nA stock is low-priced when it has a low Mcap, often due to existing negatives or concerns in the market.\nMarket participants tend to overlook these stocks because of these perceived negatives, keeping their prices low.\nThe Investment Strategy\nIdentifying Potential Multibaggers:\n\nAs investors seeking multibagger returns, our goal is to identify and invest in stocks that the market is not currently favoring.\nOnce the negative aspects are resolved, the stock\u2019s value can significantly increase.\nExample:\n\nConsider a small-cap stock in the pharmaceutical sector, such as Laurus Labs. Initially, it may have faced issues with regulatory approvals, keeping its price low. Once these hurdles were overcome, the stock saw substantial growth, becoming a multibagger.\nThe Common Misconception\nExpecting Perfect Fundamentals at Low Prices:\n\nIt is unrealistic to find a stock priced at 20 with perfect fundamentals. Such stocks will naturally have some negatives.\nLarge-cap stocks with a Mcap of 10,000 crores or more have often already delivered significant returns. Expecting them to become multibaggers from this point is impractical.\nExample:\n\nInfosys, a leading IT company, has a high Mcap and has already provided substantial returns over the years. Expecting it to continue delivering multibagger returns is unrealistic.\nThe Potential of Smaller Mcap Stocks\nSmaller Mcap Stocks Have Higher Growth Potential:\n\nStocks with a Mcap of 200 crores can grow to 2,000 crores, providing a tenfold return.\nSimilarly, a stock with a Mcap of 500 crores can grow to 5,000 crores, offering significant returns.\nExample:\n\nConsider a company like Avanti Feeds, which had a lower Mcap but expanded its business significantly, leading to multibagger returns.\nUnderstanding Market Saturation\nSaturation Point and Valuation:\n\nAfter a certain Mcap, a stock\u2019s growth potential diminishes, making it harder to achieve multibagger status.\nStocks with Mcaps above 10,000 crores require extraordinary growth to become multibaggers, which is challenging.\nExample:\n\nTata Motors, with a high Mcap, would need exceptional growth in sales and profitability to double or triple its value, which is less likely compared to smaller companies.\nSimple Rules for Stock Market Success\nBuy Less Discussed Stocks:\n\nInvesting in under-the-radar stocks can yield high returns as they are often undervalued.\nBuy Underowned Stocks:\n\nStocks with low institutional ownership may have greater growth potential once discovered.\nLook for Multibagger Prospects:\n\nFocus on companies with the potential for significant growth rather than those that have already delivered high returns.\nAvoid Stocks That Are Already Multibaggers:\n\nStocks that have already provided substantial returns may have limited future growth.\nConsider Mcap:\n\nAlways evaluate the Mcap to understand the potential for future growth. Stocks with lower Mcaps generally have higher growth potential.\nBy following these guidelines and focusing on small-cap, micro-cap, and promising mid-cap stocks, investors can build a portfolio with the potential for multibagger returns. Remember, the key lies in identifying undervalued opportunities and being patient as these stocks realize their growth potential.",

        "selftext": "There's a good opportunity in **ITC Hotels** for those who are looking for **Tax loss harvesting**.\n\nThe apportioned cost of acquisition for ITC Hotels is **13.51%** of the total amount invested in ITC Ltd pre-demerger. (Source: BSE: *https://www.itcportal.com/about-itc/shareholder-value/pdf/lodr-28jan25.pdf*)\n\n\"For example, if 1,000 Ordinary Shares of ITC were purchased at **400/-** per share by a shareholder, the total cost of acquisition would amount to 4,00,000/- before the demerger. Based on the Share Entitlement Ratio, 100 shares of ITCHL would be allotted to the said shareholder. The total cost of acquisition of **4,00,000/-** would be apportioned in the aforesaid ratio - **3,45,960/-** (86.49% of 4,00,000/-) being the total cost of acquisition of 1,000 ITC shares and **54,040/-** (13.51% of  4,00,000/-) being the total cost of acquisition of 100 shares of ITCHL.\"\n\nThe holding price of **ITC Hotels** for most allottee should be hugely BELOW the current market price, and this is the **tax loss harvesting opportunity**.\n\nContinuing the example above; the allotment price of Rs **540.40** is hugely below the current market price of **170.75** (LTP AOD 01.Feb.2025). So selling one's holding and then purchasing it back the following session should allow a tax deductible loss of *Rs 369.65* (as per the example price) per share.\n\n  \nYMMV depending on your cost of acquisition.",

The company also acquired stakes in EIH Ltd (2.44%) and HLV Ltd (0.53%). With these developments, ITC shares are back in focus. Should you buy ITC shares before the demerger?\n\nThe stock is consolidating near its 40 week EMA after previously trading above it. The 40 week EMA and trendline support coincide around 467, marking it as a strong support level. On the weekly chart, the RMI is yet to give a bullish crossover. A buying opportunity may arise if the RMI confirms a bullish crossover and the price closes above the 20 week SMA of the Bollinger Bands.Should you BUY ahead of ITC Hotels demerger record date?\n\n",

        "selftext": "Let the tears flow from the \"experts\" and institutional clowns \ud83e\udd21 who are panic-selling today. While Sensex tanked \\~750 points and Nifty kissed 23,226. The REAL INVESTORS are rubbing their hands like Thanos snapping half the universe. Here\u2019s why these \"crashes\" are a BLESSING:\n\n1.FOREIGNERS DUMPING SHARES? THANK THEM FOR THE DISCOUNT!\n\nFIIs sold \u20b91,327 CRORE worth of stocks post-Budget. Good riddance! These guys have been net sellers since October 2024, and now they\u2019re handing us CHEAP BLUE-CHIPS on a silver platter. Tata Steel, L&T, NTPC \u2013 all down 3-4%? I\u2019ll take your entire stock!\n\n2. TRUMP\u2019S TARIFF TANTRUM = BLACK FRIDAY SALE\n\n25% tariffs on Mexico/Canada and 10% on China? Global markets panicking? WHO CARES. This isn\u2019t 2018. The Modi govt\u2019s tax cuts (\u20b912.75L income = ZERO TAX) will unleash a CONSUMPTION BOOM for FMCG, autos, and durables. Maruti, ITC, Dabur at discounts? Load. The. Boat.\n\n3. MID/SMALLCAP BLOODBATH? PERFECT TIME TO BUY FUTURE MULTIBAGGERS\n\nBSE Midcap/Smallcap down 1-8%? Bharat Dynamics, JP Power, IREDA getting slaughtered? Yes, please! Retail investors with DIAMOND HANDS know corrections are where fortunes are made. Remember 2020? Exactly.\n\n4. \"BUT WHAT ABOUT RBI POLICY UNCERTAINTY!\" \u2013 STFU AND BUY\n\nThe rupee\u2019s at 87/USD, and RBI might cut rates? EVEN BETTER. Cheaper loans = more spending = auto, real estate, and consumer stocks \ud83d\udcc8. Weak hands are selling because they can\u2019t handle volatility. We feast on their fear.\n\n5. GOVT\u2019S \"LACK OF CAPEX\" IS A SMOKESCREEN\n\nSure, railway/defense/infra stocks dipped, but the Budget\u2019s \u20b9500Cr AI fund and MSME credit boost are LONG-TERM WINNERS. Paperhands crying about \"no capex\" don\u2019t understand strategic plays.\n\nCONCLUSION: This \"crash\" is a FIRE SALE for those with vision. The FII exodus and Trump\u2019s meltdown are clearing the path for retail investors to DOMINATE. Stay greedy, buy the dip, and let the panic-sellers fund your retirement.\n\n\u201dbUt heY iT\u2019s A bEaR mArKeT\u201d \u2013 \ud83e\udd13\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udeaa.\n\n(Disclaimer: Not financial advice.

If you\u2019re out in the market looking to take control of a listed company, sure, you should lap up as many of the company\u2019s shares as you can. Intuitively, you would need to buy at least 51% of the company\u2019s stock to get control. But not in India! Even if you own less than that, if the company marks you as a \u201cpromoter\u201d, you end up effectively owning \\[1\\]\u00a0the company.\n\nThere\u2019s quite a bit of confusion and conflict around this understanding. Sometimes the founder and CEO of a company owning 10% doesn\u2019t want to be called the promoter, but is\u00a0[forced to](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/vijay-shekhar-sharma-paytm-directors-face-sebi-show-cause-notices-over-ipo-breaches-12806852.html). Other times an investor who owns 17%\u00a0[cannot remove](https://www.medianama.com/2021/10/223-explained-zee-invesco-summary/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\u00a0a promoter holding less than 4%.\n\nBeing a promoter is a state of being. You don\u2019t need a large stake. If you\u2019re calling the shots day-to-day, you\u2019re a promoter. It works the other way too. If you don\u2019t control a company just yet, but want to, you better get yourself put down as a promoter. It\u2019s like drawing a superpower from within the soul of the company that gives you the permission and access to decide how it works.\n\nThis week, the Burman family, who are the promoters of the Ayurvedic brand Dabur, also\u00a0[became the promoters](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/burman-family-acquires-control-become-promoters-of-religare-enterprises-125022001226_1.html)\u00a0of Religare Enterprises, a financial services conglomerate. They were in the market to own about 51% of Religare, but their offer to buy the public\u2019s shares failed miserably. No matter! They still own 25% of its shares, but more importantly, after a long-drawn conflict, they passed the company\u2019s vibe check and managed to call themselves its promoters.\n\n# An offer that you can refuse\n\nBefore this week, Religare did not have a promoter. They did,\u00a0[once upon a time](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/from-singh-brothers-to-burman-brothers-religares-promoter-blues-continue/articleshow/105266662.cms?from=mdr), but for the last seven years they didn\u2019t. This isn\u2019t a problem. There are large companies like ITC and HDFC Bank without a promoter, and all it means is that there is no one shareholder calling the shots on how the company operates. The shareholders with varying levels of ownership have some representation on the board, which then assigns the CEO, and the CEO reports to the board just as a regular employee would. (And when the CEO leaves, their son or nephew doesn\u2019t take over.)\n\nIn September 2023, the Burmans owned \\~21% of Religare, which they bought over a few years from the open market. They intended to buy 4% more and exceed 25% in total ownership. There\u2019s a SEBI mandate around such high ownership. If you happen to own 25% of a company\u2019s shares, you have to then offer to buy at least 26% of its remaining shares as well. The idea is that this gives\u00a0*you*\u00a0the opportunity to own a controlling stake in the company, and also gives people who may not like you the opportunity to sell their stock to you and get out.\n\nIf you\u2019re a serious buyer, your offer to the public had better be more than the stock\u2019s market price. We\u2019re talking about a publicly listed company here\u2014people can sell their shares and move on anyway. The only reason they\u2019d sell to you is if you offered them a better-than-market price for their shares.\n\nWhen the Burman family first announced their intention to run an offer, Religare\u2019s stock price was around \u20b9270. The Burmans offered \u20b9235, a good 13% lower.\n\nThe Burmans announced the offer one-and-a-half years back, but it actually happened just last week. And\u00a0[it failed](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/EFAC8052-C655-4C3B-BC69-8B8C5D55B04A-134530.pdf)! They were out to buy \u20b92,116 crore of Religare stock. Shareholders agreed to sell only 0.25% of that, about \u20b95.4 crore.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the Burman family\u2019s successful takeover a little weird. They made a shitty offer, it didn\u2019t go through, and yet they control Religare? Tell me if being a promoter isn\u2019t a state of being.\n\n# She does not give up\n\nThere are two things I want to mention about Rashmi Saluja, one of them totally irrelevant to this story.\n\n1. Until last week, she was the executive chairperson of Religare.\n2. She was\u00a0[deboarded](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-kicks-out-troublesome-head-of-a-top-financial-company-as-she-was-rude/articleshow/108285668.cms?from=mdr)\u00a0from an Air India flight for being rude to the crew.\n\nSaluja had been the chairperson since\u00a0[December 2019](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/a7a2e5c3-6e03-4b41-998b-bd6ad741896a.pdf)\u00a0(the deboarding happened last year) at a time when Religare was almost a dead company because its founders\u00a0[stole](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-court-frames-criminal-conspiracy-charges-former-religare-enterprises-promoters-loss-firm-9784145/)\u00a0from the company. I don\u2019t know how Religare turned around, but it did. Saluja had been the chairperson all this while so looks like she did a\u00a0[good job](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/rashmi-saluja-steered-religare-2-0-through-upheaval-changed-firms-fortunes/articleshow/93994326.cms?from=mdr)\u00a0with it.\n\n>\\[[Image Link](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F447409d6-68c7-4b44-b7f1-7b461d0a52b8_653x408.png)\\]\n\nSaluja did not want the Burmans to take over Religare. Makes sense to me. If you\u2019re a corporate turnaround artist at a financial services company, you wouldn\u2019t want the company to be taken over by a billionaire family selling\u00a0[adulterated honey](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/health/honey-fraud-our-response-to-statements-from-dabur-patanjali-74512). But just how far do you go to keep your job?\n\nPretty far. Here\u2019s a bit from\u00a0[earlier this month](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-rashmi-saluja-moves-court-again-religare-board-fights-back-3746738/)\u00a0from the Financial Express:\n\n>The battle for control of Religare Enterprises (REL) has started looking like a never-ending soap opera. On Tuesday, Rashmi Saluja, the ousted executive chairperson of REL, made the first move by filing a fresh writ petition in the Delhi High Court, seeking to quash the open offer by the Burman family-led entities. This marks the seventh legal attempt by her to stall the takeover process. The court is expected to hear her petition on Wednesday (today).\n\nSeventh legal attempt! Saluja does not give up. \\[2\\]\n\n# Fit and proper!\n\nReligare is a holding company for a brokerage, an insurance company, and an NBFC, among other smaller businesses. For the Burman family to become the promoter, they had to get the approval of the regulator for each line of business. That\u2019s SEBI for being a broker, IRDAI for insurance, and RBI for the NBFC.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense to me, but someone looking to buy a company like Religare, cannot apply directly to the regulators for approval. Instead, the company itself has to go to its regulators and say \u201chey this guy\u2019s looking to buy me, are you okay if we let him run an offer for our shareholders to consider?\u201d. The company does have some discretion here. If a potential acquirer isn\u2019t credible, it need not go to the regulators and waste their time. But the Burmans already owned 21% of Religare, obviously had the means to buy more, so Religare didn\u2019t really have any room for discretion.\n\nAnd yet, Religare\u2019s board, led by Saluja, decided that it did not want to take the Burmans\u2019 offer to the regulators for approval. Apparently the Burmans did not meet the criteria that owners and executives for financial companies must be \u201cfit and proper\u201d.\n\nFit and proper? That sounds familiar.\u00a0[We spoke about](https://boringmoney.in/p/embassy-reit-looks-at-a-fraud#:~:text=SEBI%20wanted%20the%20REIT%E2%80%99s%20CEO%20to%20be%20a%20%E2%80%9Cfit%20and%20proper%20person%E2%80%9D%20which%20is%20just%20a%20bunch%20of%20floor%20criteria%20for%20stuff%20like%20not%20having%20defrauded%20anyone%20or%20being%20a%20criminal.%20Embassy%20REIT%E2%80%99s%20argument%20was%20that%20its%20CEO%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20need%20to%20be%20a%20%E2%80%9Cfit%20and%20proper%20person%E2%80%9D%3F!)\u00a0these criteria last year when a company argued that their CEO need not be fit and proper. Here Religare is arguing that the potential buyer absolutely must be fit and proper, and that it was deciding that they were not. Surely the Burmans must be in some financial soup? No?\n\nFrom[\u00a0From\u00a0a Mint report](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/bid-to-block-religare-acquisition-burman-family-slams-false-fir-linking-dabur-group-to-mahadev-betting-app-case-11699955913805.html):\n\n>Members of the Dabur group have issued a rebuttal after reports linked its chairman and director to the Mahadev betting app case. The Mumbai Police has reportedly booked 32 people \u2013 including Mohit Burman and Gaurav Burman \u2013 under various sections of fraud and gambling. A spokesperson for the Burman family however dubbed it a \u2018baseless\u2019 accusation that happened to coincide with their bid to acquire Religare Enterprises.\n\n>\u201cWe have not received any formal communication on any such FIR. However, we have sighted the FIR which is being circulated to media houses. The FIR is patently false and baseless. Nothing could be further from the truth than as wrongly stated in the FIR,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe Burmans announced that it was going to do an open offer and in a few weeks there were reports that they had an FIR registered against them in an unrelated betting scam. \\[3\\]\u00a0Religare used these reports to decide that the Burmans weren\u2019t fit and proper, and wouldn\u2019t even apply for approval to the regulators for good measure.\n\nThe Burmans then went to SEBI about this, who eventually forced Religare to actually apply for approval.\u00a0[This was in June 2024](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jun-2024/interim-order-cum-show-cause-notice-in-the-matter-of-religare-enterprises-limited_84286.html), a good nine months after the Burman family\u2019s initial offer announcement. \\[4\\]\n\n# Stall, stall, stall\n\nEvery year, usually sometime between July and September, every listed company in India holds their annual general meeting. This meeting is when companies are able to get all their important shareholders in one room and have them vote on things that need their approval to go through. Shareholders can also ask the board and executives questions (or share their unsolicited opinions) about the company.\n\nReligare\u2019s annual meeting was scheduled for sometime in September 2024, but the board delayed it to December. From\u00a0[Mint](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/religare-enterprises-agm-delay-shareholders-rashmi-saluja-investors-burman-family-dabur-11724591594022.html):\n\n>Three institutional shareholders said they were unhappy with the decision to postpone the AGM, especially since the company has given no explanation. The delay becomes crucial as chairperson Rashmi Saluja was up for reappointment at this AGM, initially scheduled for September.\n\n>\\[\u2026\\]\n\n>Saluja is the only non-independent director on the Religare board and, therefore, comes up for retirement at each AGM. The vote to reappoint her will now take place in December after the company secured approval to defer the AGM by three months.\n\nSaluja needed to win the shareholder vote to be reappointed as the chairperson of Religare. This vote is usually a formality, shareholders like to go for whoever\u2019s being presented. Saluja probably didn\u2019t want to risk it, so the meeting was pushed.\n\nThen in December, some random guy filed a public interest litigation (?) in the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Jabalpur\u2014a city that Religare has absolutely nothing to do with\u2014and the court\u00a0[asked to](https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/madhya-pradesh-hc-stays-religare-enterprises-agm-in-response-to-pil/119722)\u00a0wait on the meeting scheduled for 31 December (which by itself is a weird day to hold a meeting). In January, the court\u00a0[finally allowed](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/madhya-pradesh-high-court-dismisses-pil-religare-agm-rashmi-saluja-125010900673_1.html)\u00a0the meeting to proceed because it figured that the litigation was BS.\n\nThe meeting was then scheduled again for February, and this was challenged in court again! This time by Saluja herself in the Delhi High Court. The court\u00a0[refused](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/delhi-hc-rejects-rashmi-saluja-s-plea-to-halt-religare-enterprises-agm-125020601716_1.html)\u00a0to halt the meeting.\n\nOn 7 February, the meeting finally took place and\u00a0[here\u2019s what happened](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-suspense-at-agm-over-reappointment-of-saluja-3741671/):\n\n>The annual general meeting (AGM) of Religare Enterprises on Friday took an interesting turn after chairperson Rashmi Saluja stopped the discussion on her reappointment (agenda 2), stating that she was not liable to retire by rotation, said sources.\n\n>\u201cSo, we can ignore resolution number 2,\u201d she said. When an independent director present at the meeting contested her decision, she dismissed the intervention, saying that his remarks should be taken on record.\n\nSaluja still doesn\u2019t give up! In the meeting, she told everyone that she wasn\u2019t due to retire, and so there was no need for everyone to vote on her reappointment. How thoughtful of her to save everyone\u2019s time.\n\nOf course, that wasn\u2019t the end of it. In the physical meeting, she managed to stop people from voting against her by making sure the vote itself didn\u2019t happen. But voting was held online for shareholders who weren\u2019t at the meeting and two days later\u00a0[97%](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-over-97-religare-shareholders-reject-salujas-reappointment-3744393/)\u00a0of Religare\u2019s shareholders had voted against her reappointment. She was\u00a0*finally*\u00a0removed from her position as executive chairperson.\n\n# It\u2019s a state of being\n\nBack to the Burmans. They wanted to become the promoters of Religare and decide how it should operate. Initially, Religare\u2019s board of directors were against this and resisted to the extent that they could. Later it was just Saluja who remained obstinate to the extent of not even letting the Burmans\u2019 offer reach the shareholders.\n\nBecoming the promoter isn\u2019t just about owning a large stake. Sure, yes, more shares don\u2019t hurt. And beyond 51% there\u2019s not a lot anyone else can do. But with Saluja no longer a board member, there was no one to stop the Burman family from becoming a promoter. So they became the promoter! Like I said, being a promoter is a state of being.\n\nIf Saluja hadn\u2019t been booted out, whoever knows what would\u2019ve happened? With the Burmans\u2019 offer practically rejected by shareholders, there is no way she would\u2019ve let Religare name them as the promoters. Eventually, sure, the Burmans would have succeeded. But that would cost time, legal fees, and maybe a lot more money for yet another long-drawn offer.\n\n# Stay out of jail card\n\nWhy was Saluja hell bent on halting the Burmans\u2019 offer? Maybe because she paid herself a lot! She held too much sway within the company and figured out a way to earn many multiples more than other executives at the same level. From\u00a0[the Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/religare-finvest-issued-esops-to-rashmi-saluja-a-day-after-burmans-open-offer/articleshow/106497688.cms?from=mdr):\n\n>\\[\u2026\\] Rashmi Saluja, executive chairperson of the company, acquired around 8% stake in its wholly-owned shadow bank Religare Finvest Limited (RFL), through an Employees Stock Option Plan (Esop) award, documents reviewed by ET reveal.\n\n>The award in the unlisted subsidiary ascribed its value in a band of Rs150-260 crore. Previously, proxy advisory firm InGovern had estimated the Esops awarded to Saluja in Religare Enterprises as well as its health insurance subsidiary Care Health Insurance to be worth Rs480 crore. Together with the thus far undeclared award of stock options in Religare Finvest, the total compensation earned by Saluja via Esops could be between Rs630 and Rs740 crore. This is in addition to the annual salary and places Saluja among the highest paid executives in Indian corporate history.\n\nHighest paid executive in\u00a0*Indian corporate history*! \\[5\\]\u00a0Most of Saluja\u2019s compensation came from the employee stock options pool of Religare\u2019s subsidiaries, worth anywhere between \u20b9630 crore to \u20b9740 crore ($73m to $86m). Her stake was so high that it would represent 8% of Religare\u2019s NBFC! The stock option pool is usually between 5\u201310%, meant to serve as an incentive for\u00a0*all*\u00a0employees to work to get the stock price up and stick around for longer. Saluja hogged the entire thing.\n\nOkay, fighting to stay around as the highest paid executive in Indian corporate history would be alluring. But come on, the annual general meeting was seven days away, and she sued the company she was the chairperson at! And asked shareholders to casually ignore something they were to vote on! That\u2019s extreme.\n\nThe Burman family have been\u00a0[demanding](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/burman-family-demands-sebi-investigation-in-allotment-of-8-esops-shares-to-rfl-chairman-rashmi-saluja-11704286617650.html)\u00a0an investigation into Saluja\u2019s compensation. If the numbers are true, and they seem to be, Saluja has almost certainly been defrauding the company and its investors. With the Burmans running the company, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if any documentation around her compensation reached the investigator as a neatly formatted PDF of evidence. That makes her extreme behaviour make a\u00a0[little bit more](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/ed-summons-religare-chairperson-rashmi-saluja-for-questioning/articleshow/116183872.cms?from=mdr)\u00a0sense.\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I use \u201cownership\u201d for promoters liberally, even though they don\u2019t technically own the company. In everyday conversation I think the distinction doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n\\[2\\] This better be the name of any biography that happens to be written about Saluja.\n\n\\[3\\] There\u2019s some\u00a0[dumb stuff happening](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/remote-controlled-plaint-cops-may-quiz-rashmi-saluja/articleshow/118461248.cms)\u00a0here that I wouldn\u2019t even be able to scratch the surface of.\n\n\\[4\\] Religare then challenged SEBI\u2019s ruling in the SAT, which\u00a0[asked it to comply](https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/sat-to-religare-comply-with-sebi-order-apply-for-open-offer-by-july-22/117512). So that was another month wasted.\n\n\\[5\\] I like how the Economic Times emphasises this, but this may or may not be true! I doubt Saluja would keep getting those stock options every year for life. So not entirely accurate to count it as part of her regular compensation.\n\nOriginal Source: [https://boringmoney.in/p/burman-open-offer-religare-promoter](https://boringmoney.in/p/burman-open-offer-religare-promoter?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=religare+burman+saluja)",

        "selftext": "EID Parry is like that grand old tree in your backyard\u2014rooted deep in history, yet constantly sprouting new branches. It was founded 182 years ago, and if we calculate its lifespan using the\u00a0[Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect), it will still be around in 2206.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just any sugar business; it\u2019s an agricultural titan in disguise, churning out everything from your morning sugar to spirulina, fertilizers and biofuels. So, grab your favourite\u00a0[Mithai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweets_from_the_Indian_subcontinent), and let\u2019s dive in!\n\nContents:\n\n1. Company overview & business model\n2. Balance sheet & capital allocation\n3. Valuation\n4. Risks\n5. Future growth potential\n6. Conclusion & sources\n\n# Company overview & business model\n\nEID Parry is part of the\u00a0[Murugappa group](https://mysuccessproject.in/murugappa-group-explore-the-120-years-legacy/), one of the oldest business groups in India with 28+ businesses and a long history of fiduciary responsibility.\n\n* Parry is the largest sugar manufacturer in South India. It started in 1842, when it opened the country\u2019s first ever sugar plant at Nellikuppam, Tamil Nadu\n* 30% of the sugar output is sold under the Parry brand, while 70% is sold in bulk.\n   * The management team have indicated that they are planning to \u201cmove up the value chain\u201d, with more focus on their branded line of sugar and nutraceuticals (spirulina , palmetto etc.).\n   * The Indian government curbed\u00a0[sugar exports in 2023](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/india-extends-curbs-sugar-exports-calm-domestic-prices-2023-10-18/), in order to control domestic sugar prices\n   * To combat the sugar business's cyclicality, Parry has also significantly invested in distillery capacity, aligning with the Indian government's plan for increased domestic energy supply.\n* Their branded sugar and FMCG business (27% of their revenue) is scaling rapidly, with the number of distribution outlets increasing from 20k in 2021 to 110k currently\n* Apart from this, they also have a power generation and sugar refinery businesses, both of which have struggled to maintain profitability. These two business have depressed the margins over the last five years, which were around 1% on average.\n* Even if loss-making units break even, margins would only increase to a razor-thin 2-3%, reflecting the commoditized nature of the sugar industry.\n\n# Holding company structure\n\nThe Murugappa group took over EID Parry in 1981 and now own 38.3% of business. EID Parry, in turn, owns 56% of Coromandel International, which it had co-founded in the 1960s.\n\n* Coromandel is the largest private phosphatic fertiliser manufacturer, and 2nd largest overall. The company enjoys 60% market share in the \u2018Rice Bowl\u2019 regions of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana\n* Around half of Coromandel\u2019s sales come from exports, where they see significant headroom for growth\n* [IFFCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Farmers_Fertiliser_Cooperative), which is a Fertiliser Cooperative, is the largest fertilizer producer in India, with roughly twice the revenues of Coromandel. Coromandel has been gaining market share, with revenues growing \\~11% CAGR since 2019, while IFFCOs sales have remained flat\n\n# Balance sheet and capital allocation\n\n* EID Parry had significant debt before 2020 but has since paid down a majority, leading to a fortress-like balance sheet and net cash of \u20b923 billion (\u20b92300 crore) as of March 2024\n* This gives them flexibility to invest in sugar-adjacent businesses (like distillery & nutraceuticals) and buy depressed assets during market downturns.\n* Capital allocation has been hit-and-miss, with some of their ventures like Coromandel and the sugar distillery investments generating high ROCE , while other ones like the refinery have had very poor returns.\n   * Overall , ROCE has been exceptional, averaging 26% since 2017\n   * The management has expressed interest in further inorganic expansion in the FMCG space, but they have been pretty prudent so fair in sizing their capital investments, while maintaining a pristine balance sheet\n   * Parry have also reduced their Coromandel stake from 60%+ to 56% currently. But don\u2019t seem to have any plans to further trim their position.\n* They haven\u2019t fully reinvested their earnings. So, they do pay out dividends and have built up a cash position. An approximate capital deployment break-down over the last few years:\n   * 50% re-invested into CAPEX\n   * 30% paid out in dividend\n   * 20% going to debt repayment or cash reserves\n\n# Valuation\n\nMany of the previous valuations I\u2019ve read online seem to take a comparative valuation approach with a \u201cHold-Co discount\u201d added on top. However, I chose to employ a discounted cash flow analysis, assuming the earnings of Coromandel will flow through to EID Parry shareholders eventually, either via dividends or incremental equity ownership.\n\nWarren Buffett follows a similiar approach, by using \u201c[look-though earnings](https://mastersinvest.com/newblog/2017/2/19/the-buffett-series-focus-on-the-earnings)\u201d to value Berkshire Hathaway and other holding companies. Subsidiaries should only pay dividends if they cannot re-invest capital in their business at a high hurdle rate.\n\nMy estimates for value per share are given below. The full assumptions can be found\u00a0[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lm1JZtfuQudOFddkLIAPrMp7RLtx5_Zj/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114836972199643253007&rtpof=true&sd=true). \n\n[Value per share](https://imgur.com/lZDYxbz)\n\n* Bear:  **\u20b9645**\n* Base: **\u20b9911**\n* Bull: **\u20b91,267**\n\nNotes:\n\n* The Coromandel stake represents \\~70% of EID Parry\u2019s value per share, so it forms a core part of the investment thesis. At current prices, you are essentially getting the sugar business and assets for \u201cfree\u201d, as the Coromandel stake and net cash are worth \u20b9755\n* If I valued the Coromandel stake at their current market price instead of using a discounted cash flow method, EID\u2019s 56% ownership of Coromandel equals \u20b91112 per share (after subtracting 25% in taxes) - 20% higher than my bull case estimate of \u20b9914. The markets seem to be valuing Coromandel with double-digit growth expectations for the next decade.\n\nI had initially bought EID Parry in March 2022 and added to my position subsequently, so my average cost is \u20b9508 (much lower than current levels). The stock now looks close to fairly valued, with the gap between price and value narrowing significantly since the beginning of 2024. The stock currently represents 10% of my India portfolio - I plan to hold it for the next several years (or ideally forever).\n\n[PPFAS](https://amc.ppfas.com/), a mutual fund I follow, has also invested in EID Parry since January 2024. However, it currently represents a small portion (0.2%) of their flexi-cap fund. They appear to have stopped adding to their position since February 2024, when the share price was around \u20b9600.\n\n# Future growth potential\n\nThe current stock price seems fairly valued, but provides some free \u201ccall options\u201d that I haven\u2019t consider yet in the valuation:\n\n* EID Parry\n   * Indian sugar consumption could grow significantly: Indian per-capita consumption is around\u00a0[22kg per year](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sugar-projections-consumption-per-capita_5jrzxx43xv37.pdf), while developed countries are at\u00a0[36kg per year](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sugar-projections-consumption-per-capita_5jrzxx43xv37.pdf).\n   * The Indian government drops the sugar export ban, leading to higher sugar realization prices\n   * The Indian government ramps up the Ethanol blending program to reduce reliance on energy imports (similiar to\u00a0[Brazil](https://www.energy-observer.org/resources/bioethnaol-brazilian-success-story))\n   * FMCG grows to become a significant part of the business (similiar to\u00a0[ITC](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/itcs-fmcg-business-set-to-touch-4-billion-mark/articleshow/111352796.cms)\u2019s successful scale-up)\n   * The freehold land bank owned by EID Parry, which they estimate to be valued at \u20b9394 Cr (or \u20b922 per share of EID Parry)\n* Coromandel could significantly ramp up export volumes: their current capacity is 4.5MMT (million metric ton), while the largest global crop nutrient manufacturers are close to\u00a0[20\\~30MMT](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1266558/plant-capacity-largest-fertilizer-manufacturers-worldwide/)\n\n# Risks\n\n* EID Parry\n   * Global sugar prices plummet lower than EID\u2019s production costs, leading to under-utilization and losses\n   * The Indian government sets the MSP (minimum support price) for sugar purchases from farmers and could end up squeezing EID\u2019s sugar margins.\n   * Poor monsoons or pest related issues in South India, leading to lower sugar cane yields\n* Coromandel faces significant litigation risks related to toxic chemical handling. The most recent example was a\u00a0[gas leak at Ennore on Dec 2023](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chennai/ennore-gas-leak-tamil-nadu-govt-panel-coromandel-pay-penalty-9144811/), which resulted in a fine of \u20b96\u00a0Cr.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nEID Parry appears to be well positioned, both on the production and consumption side of India\u2019s agriculture food chain.\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\nYou can view additional graphics in the article [here](https://opensourceinvestor.substack.com/p/eid-parry-nseeidparry-an-agriculture).\n\nThanks,  \nSharad  \n[OpenSourceInvestor @ Substack](https://opensourceinvestor.substack.com/)",

What sets them apart from Oberoi and Tata and international hotels is that their work environment is almost govt like, standard pay for all employees, strict working limits of 9 hours for all staff (permanent and trainees), cafeteria food is great, etc. All weekly offs were given without any lapses. \n\nThe same is not a norm for the entire hotel industry in India. Long working hours, low pay, no benefits nothing. Most people who intend to keep working in hotel line and join ITC, they spend their life in it. It's one of the best hotels to work for, and any company that can keep their employees happy, is bound to flourish. \n\nWhen I did my internship at ITC Sonar in 2015, most hotels in Delhi, Mumbai etc offered \u20b9750-1000 per month stipend, with approx 14 hour shifts. ITC gave everyone all over India \u20b91000 stipend with strict 9 hour shifts. Mind you this 4 month internship is part of hotel management curriculum for the degree provided by IHMs all over India. So there is no minimum wage that companies have to give here. \n\nMost customers I interacted with were repeat customers of ITC and they came back either because they liked the food or the overall service of the hotel. The restaurants are almost always packed every night, as evident by the restaurant manager's face after it closes for the night.",

Like employee retention must be great but its a double edge sword\n\nYou are right. Most of the employees in higher up positions are old, some people who work in entry level positions are old (they have been doing that for their entire life). It is a double edged sword, but the hotel industry is a bit different when it comes to labor work.You'll always have contract workers available for menial and heavy lifting tasks. So older permanent employees who have more experience can manage a lot of contract workers themselves, often handling entire sub-departments. Newer permanent employees often end up working the same tasks as the contract workers so they can learn how it goes. Employees with the most experience are often the master of their art, like the biryani chef who made the entire hotel's biryani at Sonar.\n\n>Second how much push have you seen for ashirwad products, itc frozen food products, sunfeasts and chocolates etc integration?\n\nAlmost anything that ITC makes that can be used as raw material for the kitchen, was exclusively used. Customer facing products like cookies and cakes were baked at the in-house bakery, so you might not see Sunfeast cookies on a platter near lounges. Frozen processed products are not used. Everything is made in-house. The only frozen products were meat like salmon that had to be imported.\n\n>How is the room occupancy throughout the year compared to other places?\n\nHotel's occupancy is cyclical in nature. During seasonal holidays everything is overbooked, rooms, banquets etc. During off-seasons we may run on 30-40% occupancy. All major hotels rely on the December and wedding season for their bulk revenue. Business travellers and celebrities also account for a good portion. During the IPLs entire cricket teams along with their personnel stay in these hotels. But a lot might have changed during or after covid.",

Should you buy ITC shares before the demerger?\n\nThe stock is consolidating near its 40 week EMA after previously trading above it. The 40 week EMA and trendline support coincide around 467, marking it as a strong support level. On the weekly chart, the RMI is yet to give a bullish crossover.

Do you expect the lower circuit hits like JioFin experienced during the early days of it's listing?",
