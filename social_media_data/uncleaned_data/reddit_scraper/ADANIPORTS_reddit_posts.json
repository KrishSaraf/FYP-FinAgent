        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

        "selftext": "(Warning: Long Post)\n\nI'm 22 M, graduated college recently, and I've recently started to learn about the Stock Market and Mutual Funds. I learned Fundamental Analysis using Zerodha Varsity, and I'm also constantly reading up on investment basics, strategies, considerations, etc.\n\nMy parents are financially very strong, and gave me 12L to put in mutual funds (I will eventually pay the 12L back). After discussing with a friend of theirs who works at Nuvama Investments, I have invested this amount in a mixture of large, mid, and Flexicap funds and some debt funds. I'm expecting good returns from them in the next 3-5 years.\n\nNow, I had around 2.4 L left from a mixture of my internship savings and the money left in my account for my college expenses). My parents encouraged me to start investing in stocks, given I had already done a bit of research. \n\nI used Screener to filter out some stocks for the long term using some metrics, then did some research on the company to find out the current market and investor sentiment before finally investing in it. I have also identified the major sectors that are going to grow in the next 5 years: Infra, PSU Banks, Defence, Railways, and Oil and Gas. Based on all this,  this is my portfolio right now:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ma5z40ix48d1.png?width=1267&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f9ef46d6151deee483f35aa62529ad8153323ae\n\nHAL, BEL, and other Defense stocks seemed to be on a bullish run, and the sentiment about Defense stocks was that they were going to increase a lot. But HAL and BEL dropped a lot these past two days, and what doesn't help is that I've been seeing a lot of news recently about the markets being at an all-time high and some impending corrections coming soon. I was planning to invest in other Defense stocks as well (MAZDOCK, Cochin shipyard, and Paras Defense) but I'm not sure whether right now is a good time to enter these. \n\nI would love to hear some advice about my portfolio in general. I plan to hold most of them for the long term (3-5 years). I think I have bought too much SBI, I plan to sell half of it at a profit and invest in some other stocks. Some stocks on my watchlist are Railway (IRFC, IRCON, and RVNL), Sun Pharma (Very Strong Financials for the Long Term), and Tata Motors (I've seen People Recommend this stock a lot).\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on these. Also, I'll start earning soon (around \\~1.4L per month post taxes) and I plan to also invest a bit in small-cap MFs, some Debt Instruments, and FDs. I live at home and have negligible monthly expenses, so I'm planning to invest most of my monthly income.\n\n\n\n  \n",

Since this is a bull run and sectors you picked are in momentum right now. My only advice is that you keep a close eye on your portfolio and don\u2019t hesitate to rebalance if you see a  manor shift (+/- 10%) in any sector. For future investment my advice will be 60/40 ; 60% in MF SIPs and 40% in stocks. This strategy will go a long way and I expect to give an annual return of 20+%. Also keep SBIN and keep on adding on dips.",

However, I've recently been focused on a strategy based on the earnings dates of Nifty 100 companies, using a risk-reward ratio of 1:2.\n\nThe results so far look very promising and suggest that the strategy can be further optimized to increase returns. The numbers seem almost too good to be true. Below are some of the results.\n\n[Orders](https://preview.redd.it/jdg8up4tsipd1.png?width=368&format=png&auto=webp&s=36bc0e7f55b70e65b43e958cb2e5ddc4aee42b2d)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khsnn3bwsipd1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=8709588132a8949334620c756c8b406f370dbda5\n\n",

Also, if I need to reduce the number of MFs, which SIPs should I keep and which should I let go?\n\n2. **Should I invest less in SIPs and more in stocks?**\n\nI'm 29, and my friends say my risk appetite is higher. However, I prefer long-term investments and don't have the time or expertise to buy/sell stocks regularly. Am I making a mistake by focusing more on SIPs? Should I allocate more to stocks?\n\n3. **Should I consider an SWP?**\n\n4. I have 10 lacs to invest now. Any suggestions on how to allocate this based on my current portfolio?\n\nSorry for the many questions, but I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!",

                "body": "1. Yeah I think you have way too many MF's. You can reduce it to 4-5 funds max. Please check the overlap between the different funds. I don't think multiple ELSS Tax Saver funds are required. Just keep 1 from each category. The reason for not keeping multiple MF's is, different expense ratios can keep eating into your profits.\n2. If you don't have time to analyse and buy/sell stocks, you can continue with your SIP, no problem in that. You mentioned that you are picking stocks based on your friend's suggestions, and that can go horribly wrong. It's your life and your financial goals, so you can take the call about which way you want to go. Nothing wrong with either.",
