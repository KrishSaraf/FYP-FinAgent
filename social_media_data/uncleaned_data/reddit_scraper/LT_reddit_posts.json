        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n**A summery of a couple important points**\n\nThe uranium sector is in a growing global uranium supply deficit that can't be solved in a couple of years time, while:\n\n* recently the biggest uranium producing country of the world, Kazakhstan, made a 17% cut in the previously promised production level for 2025 and also hinting on lower production levels for 2026 and beyond than previously hoped.\n* followed by additional production cuts from other uranium producers (Uranium mining is hard)\n* recently Putin started the threat of soon restricting uranium deliveries to the West, meaning Russian uranium, Russian enriched uranium, uranium from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan that goes through Russia to the port of Saint Petersburg.\n* followed by Kazatomprom (Kazakhstan) stating that uranium deliveries to the West has become difficult and could become even more difficult in the future (--> Putin's threat)\n* Microsoft paying for 100% of electricity from the Three Mile Island reactor they asked Constellation to restart in 2028 = That's unexpected additional uranium demand for delivery in 2025.\n* Uranium demand is price inelastic\n* The inventory created in 2011-2017 (when uranium sector was in oversupply) that helped to solve the structural global deficit starting early 2018, is now depleted! (Confirmed by UxC)\n\n**A couple points more in detail:**\n\n**A.** There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.\n\nLet me explain\n\na) The gas price represents \\~70% of total production cost of electricity coming from a gas-fired power plant. So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!\n\nThe uranium price only represents \\~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105\n\nb) the uranium spotprice is only for supply adjustments, while the main part of the uranium supply goes through LT contracts. So when an uranium consumer needs 50k lb uranium through a spot purchase in addition to the 450k lbs they got through an existing LT contract to be able to start the nuclear fuel rods fabrication, than they will just buy those 50k lb at any price, because blocking the start of the nuclear fuel rods fabrication is not an option.\n\nc) buying uranium (example: 50k lb) at 150 USD/lb through the spotmarket, doesn't mean they need to buy 100% of their uranium needs at 150 USD/lb (example: 100% is 500k lb)\n\nThose are the 3 main reasons why **uranium demand is price INelastic**\n\n**B.** The evolution from oversupply in 2011-2017 to a structural global deficit since early 2018 and growing in the future\n\nFrom 2011 till end 2017 the global uranium market was in oversupply which created an uranium inventory X (explained in a detailed 30 pages long report of mine in August 2023 where I calculated the creation of inventory X and the consumption of it starting early 2018)\n\nSince early 2018 the global uranium market is in big structural deficit and this structural deficit will continue for the coming years for different reasons which have been consuming that inventory X\n\nBut now that inventory X is mathematically depleted. In previous high season (September 2023 - March 2024) we saw the first impact of that nearing depletion with the uranium spotprice going from 56 USD/lb in August 2023 to 106 USD/lb early February 2024\n\nA good month ago a non-US utility went semi-public by sending an email to different uranium stakeholders in the world because they couldn't find 300,000 lb of uranium for delivery in October 2024. Not a surprise because inventory X is depleted now, and there aren't enough idle uranium productions left in the world to close the supply gap. And those few idle production capacities will take years to get back online.\n\n300,000lb is not even enough to run one 1000 Mwe reactor for 1 year! The total global operational nuclear fleet capacity today is 395,388 Mwe\n\nSo now that that inventory X is depleted, the structural global uranium deficit has to be solved with a lot of new production that is't available.\n\nHow come?\n\nDuring 2011-2020 not enough was invested in exploration and development of new uranium deposits, while existing uranium mines are nearing depletion.\n\nAn example: The biggest uranium project in the world is Arrow in Canada, but that projects needs at least 4 years of construction before it can produce the first pound of uranium, and the greenlight for the construction start hasn't been given yet.\n\nThe production start of other smaller uranium projects have been postponed:\n\n* Dasa: postponed by 1 year from early 2025 to early 2026\n* Phoenix: postponed by at least 2 years from 2025 to 2027 at the earliest\n\nWhile producers are producing less than hopped: the majors Cameco, Kazaktomprom, Orano, CGN, Uranium One, ... but also Paladin Energy (2.5Mlb instead of 3.2Mlb planned for 2024), UR-Energy, ...\n\nAnd at the demand side, the last 3+ years a lot of uranium reactors licences have been extended by an additional 20 years and even some by an additional 40 years. But that's a lot of unexpected additional uranium demand that the uranium sector haven't prepared for.\n\n**C.** A couple weeks ago Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond\n\n[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/j1tmr0xvu0ud1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04b6b501fe519f07552943f59eadc5cf396c7ed4)\n\nMy previous post goes more in detail on that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fhp6h5/different\\_ways\\_to\\_tell\\_utilities\\_that\\_biggest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fhp6h5/different_ways_to_tell_utilities_that_biggest/)\n\nConclusion of previous post:\n\n**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce**. Meaning that they will soon all together try to buy uranium through the illiquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket (Uranium One) has less uranium to sell now.\n\nAnd the less uranium producers deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket themself.\n\nThere is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy a significant volume of uranium in the illiquide spotmarket during the new high season in the uranium sector.\n\nAnd before that production cut announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:\n\n[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world](https://preview.redd.it/xzo37cg5v0ud1.jpg?width=534&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33ed5d7865621bca4c84cd1d9afdb5b12494f280)\n\nWith all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last couple of weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\n\nWe are at the beginning of the high season in the uranium sector.\n\n**D.** On Sunday: The Zuuvch uranium mine of Orano is delayed by at least 2 years!\n\nThis was an important uranium project.\n\nThat's a loss of 14Mlb! (2\\*7Mlb/y)\n\n[Source: @z\\_axis\\_capital on X \\(twitter\\)](https://preview.redd.it/uw65uo08v0ud1.jpg?width=954&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fff037629c0b813bd8f972640ecce08d9f07c187)\n\nOrano is a major uranium producers. They have a serious problem.\n\nThey lost uranium production in Niger in 2023/2024, they lost the Imouraren uranium project in Niger in 2024, and now this delay in production start of Zuuvch uranium mine.\n\nOrano already had to buy uranium in the spotmarket to be able to honor their supply commitements. But now they will have to buy even more in the very tight uranium spotmarket\n\n**E. 2 triggers (=> Break out of uranium price starting now imo)**\n\na) On October 1st the new uranium purchase budgets of US utilities will be released.\n\nWith all latest announcements (big production cuts from Kazakhstan, uranium supply warning from Kazatomprom, Putin's threat on restricting uranium supply to the West, UxC confirming that inventory X is now depleted, additional announcements of lower uranium production from other uranium suppliers the last week, ...), those new budgets will be significantly bigger than the previous ones.\n\nb) The last \\~6 months LT contracting has been largely postponed by utilities (only \\~40Mlb contracted so far) due to uncertainties they first wanted to have clarity on.\n\nNow there is more clarity. By consequence they will now accelerate the LT contracting and uranium buying\n\nThe upward pressure on the uranium spot and LT price is about to increase significantly\n\nOn October 2nd we got the first information of a lot of RFP's being launched!\n\n**F. LT uranium supply contracts signed today are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**\n\nAlthough the uranium spotprice is the price most investors look at, in the sector most of the uranium is delivered through LT contracts using a combination of LT price escalated to inflation and spot related price at the time of delivery.\n\nHere the evolution of the LT uranium price:\n\n[Source: Cameco](https://preview.redd.it/bd40kybfv0ud1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1cd91e13299041d7cd7e9f6995efd1d7e670c2d)\n\nThe global uranium shortage is structural and can't be solved in a couple of years time, not even when the uranium price would significantly increase from here, because the problem is the needed time to explore, develop and build a lot of new mines!\n\nDuring the low season (around March till around September) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price weakens and the uranium spot price goes a bit down to be closer to the LT uranium price.\n\nIn the high season (around September till around March) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price increases again and the uranium spot price goes back up faster than the month over month price increase of the LT uranium price\n\nThe official LT price is update once a month at the end of the month.\n\n**LT uranium supply contracts signed today (September) are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**\n\n=> an average of 105 USD/lb\n\nWhile the uranium LT price of end August 2024 was 81 USD/lb. Today TradeTech announced a new uranium LT price of 82 USD/lb, while Cameco announces a 81.5 LT uranium price of end September 2024.\n\nBy consequence there is a high probability that not only the uranium spotprice will increase faster coming weeks with activity picking up in the sector, but also that uranium LT price is going to jump higher in coming months compared to the 81.5 USD/lb of end September 2024.\n\nHere is a fragment of a report of Cantor Fitzgerald written before the Kazak uranium supply warning, before the uranium supply threat from Putin, and before the additional cuts in 2024 productions from other uramium suppliers:\n\n[Source: Cantor Fitzgerald, posted by John Quakes on X \\(twitter\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xwr98d0kv0ud1.jpg?width=528&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=797b8d24410580d5e48d866182ccdb7cbd7af626)\n\n**G. Russia is preparing a long list of export curbs**\n\nAfter the announcement of the huge (17%) cut in the planned production for 2025 and beyond of the biggest uranium producer of the world (Kazakhstan: \\~45% of world production), now Putin asked his people to look into the possibilities to restrict some commodities export to the Western countries, explicitely mentioning uranium\n\n[https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm](https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm)\n\n**H. The uranium spot price increase that slowely started a week ago is now accelerating (some stakeholders have been frontrunning the 2 triggers starting previous week)**\n\nAlthough the uranium LT price is much more important for the sector, most investors look at the uranium spotprice.\n\nUranium spotprice increase on Numerco:\n\n[Source: Numerco website](https://preview.redd.it/5bcegcumv0ud1.jpg?width=607&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f3523ec8df724119fc854b770efd02759af0317)\n\n**The ingredients for a uraniumsqueeze in the spotmarket are present**\n\nWhat happens when uranium spotbuying increases, while the pounds of uranium available for spotselling decrease?\n\nCauses:\n\na) Uranium One (100% production from Kazakhstan) producing less uranium than previously hoped by many (Utilities, Intermediaries, other producers). So less primary production to sell in spot\n\nb) Inventory X, created in 2011-2017 that solved the annual primary deficit since early 2018, is now mathematically depleted. (Confirmed by UxC)\n\nc) Utilities and Intermediaries increasing their minimum operational inventory levels due to the growing uranium supply insecurity => With supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others\n\nInvestors underestimate the impact of Russian threat alone. The threat alone (without effectively going through with it) is sufficient for utilities to go from supply security to supply insecurity.\n\nUtilities and Intermediaries trade uranium between each other. But with supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others\n\n**The last commercially available lbs will become unavailable before even being sold!** => Consequence: soon potential squeeze in spot\n\nBreak out higher of the uranium price is inevitable\n\nAnd if Putin goes through with his threat, than the squeeze will be very big, knowing that uranium demand is price inelastic.\n\n\n\n**I. A couple investment possibilities**\n\n**Yellow Cake** (YCA on London stock exchange) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). **Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.**:\n\n* With a YCA share price of 5.87 GBP/sh we buy uranium at \\~75.69 USD/lb, while the uranium spotprice is at 83.50 USD/lb and LT uranium price of 81.5 USD/lb\n* a YCA share price of 7.75 GBP/sh represents uranium at 100 USD/lb\n* a YCA share price of 9.30 GBP/sh represents uranium at 120 USD/lb\n* a YCA share price of 11.65 GBP/sh represents uranium at 150 USD/lb\n\nAnd with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\n\n**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:\n\n* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in uranium sector\n* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNM.L): 100% invested in uranium sector\n* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNP.L): 100% invested in uranium sector\n* Geiger Counter Limited (GCL.L): 100% invested in uranium sector\n* Betashares Global Uranium ETF (URNM on ASX): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector\n\n\n\nA couple individual uranium companies:\n\n**Cameco** (CCJ on NYSE / CCO on TSX)\n\n**Paladin Energy** (PDN on ASX) is significantly cheaper than Cameco and Paladin Energy doesn't have the construction/design risk of Cameco. Once Paladin Energy will be listed in the TSX (in coming weeks), I expect Paladin Energy to catch up to the valuation of TSX and NYSE listed uranium peers like Cameco, UR-Energy, Energy Fuels, ...\n\nThe shareholders of Fission Uranium Corp that has one of the highest grades well advanced Triple R deposit in the world (Canada) approved the takeover by Paladin Energy. And yesterday, the court also approved the takeover.\n\nPaladin Energy and Fission Uranium Corp company combined will be a beast (Cash inflows from Langer Heinrich to finance the construction of Triple R), yet Paladin Energy and Fission Uranium Corp today are significantly cheaper on a EV/lb basis than respectively CCJ and NXE today.\n\n**Deep Yellow** (DYL on ASX) and **Bannerman Energy** (BMN on ASX) have both beautiful projects and are very cheap on a EV/lb basis compared to peers like NXE, DNN, FCU, while both DYL and BMN have a lot of cash on their bank account today.\n\n**Boss Energy** (BOE on ASX): uranium producers 100% owner of Honeymoon uranium mine and 30% owner of Alta Mesa\n\n\n\n**This isn't financial advice. Please do your own due diligence before investing**\n\nCheers",

        "selftext": "Hello all, I am sharing a long term (by rough estimate of 34 years) success story. What you see in the picture is a our family's stock portfolio. I could have given a screenshot of broker but they are just so spread out. \n\n\n\nBy our estimate, my father doesn't know for sure, the beginging of the pf goes back to 1990, and we have some securities since then. My father did good that he understood the potential of it, when others around him didn't. How he got started is that he used to work in bank, and folks used to come to banks to get demand draft in 90s when applying for IPO (how things have changed!!) and he along with other members of staff also used to apply to few, the only difference was that if got allotted, my fathers colleague used to sell to get listing gains, and he used to just hang on to them. And, with time he got himself more educated, we still get \"Dalal street investment Journal\" since late 90s. Though, he never invested in mutual funds, which i am still unable to understand. In my 12th grade, i supplied whole class of 25 students of commerce section with annual reports, and when i was a kid i always used to judge companies by quality of their annual reports, and colgate was the most finely printed. \n\n\n\nWas my father an \"educated\" investor, probably not, if you throw words like EPS, bull, bear, correction, pullback, EBIDTA, half of the word he would not understand, let alone answer them, but what he subconsciously knew was his strength which was limited activity, he has never really sold any shares because \"price was down\", if you ask me have beaten the market (TWRR or IRR), i can't answer that, but what i can answer is that we have created a sizable corpus of securities which all the people in our social group has not, and this is simple long term effect of compounding. \n\n\n\nSome points\n\n-We would be what you call as active-passive investor, we have investment in every kind, Mutual funds, index funds, stocks public and private, india and outside. \n\n\n\n-Since time immorial we have applied to IPOs and we have some failures and some spectuacular successes. Some IPO successes are HDFC, Genus Power (no one knew of this until 2 years and we held thru all the \"dark\" days), Divis, Dmart. Recent ones are Kaynes, Zomato, and most recent in Bajaj Housing finance. And, we not sold a single one of them, they may die on us but haven't sold. \n\n\n\n-Some failures, one in particular comes to mind is golden forest based out of Chandigarh which later turned out to be a ponzi scheme, and then there is YesBank, some sucking IPOs are paytm and CapitalSFB. \n\n\n\n-We have held some stocks so long that we don't know what the purchase date is or purchase price, reliance (went thru whole emotional cycle of Dhiru dying, brothers quarrel, ADAG and Jio, and now expected division into 3 companies), Colgate, LT, Videocon, which we was high flyer and then went private (Nayara) but we have held thru it. \n\n\n\n-For good or bad, we have always considered this PF as something which is like family \"darohar\" something which has to be passed onto generations, and we treat it like that, something to be not messed up. \n\n\n\nI am not saying this is best method or the only method, I am saying this is a method which we, in my opinion have achieved success. As they say play your own game. \n\n\n\nI'll end with a comment my father makes when we talk about frequent downturns in stocks \"'my name\" abhi to 1st inning hai, game ka result to 5th day ko pata chalega\". We have never graduated from 1st inning. \n\n\n\nIf you have any questions feel free. \n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/spi40clwerqd1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=d143f7671d0bb4a3d4b42dcd12d7b143b06a793d\n\n",

At the end of the 5th year, he returns you your Rs 100 along with Rs 9 for that years interest. Since there is no market linkage here and the 9% is contractual and obligatory by law, debt is used for income.\n\nFor example, all public sector companies and banks regularly borrow money from public via a debt instrument called 'bond'. They take say Rs 10 lakh from you for 10 years, promise you to pay 9% interest per year for 9 years, and in the 10th year they pay you 9% interest plus return your Rs 10 lakh they had borrowed.\n\nA fixed deposit is the simplest bond between you and the bank. You lend your money to the bank for some interest for a fixed time period, and earn interest from them.\n\nSince in case if debt instruments the interest rate payable by borrower, the final payment date, interest payment dates are all mentioned and are enforceable by law, AND they are not linked to equity markets, they are used for generating consistent income.

Soon we will entre the high season again\n\nUranium spotprice is close to the long term price again, like in August 2023 (end of low season in 2023), which creates a strong bottom for the uranium price\n\n[Source: Cameco](https://preview.redd.it/ycqkf1ldoxjd1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb70fd945565b1cb4065cc38a2431f0caffc8e4f)\n\n[Source: Skysurfer75 on X](https://preview.redd.it/6eozl9reoxjd1.jpg?width=1355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84479c38605a2dc798facf02dbdfbdab731bd6e4)\n\n**Why a strong bottom for uranium price?**\n\nBecause it becomes very interesting to buy uranium in spotmarket to sell through existing LT contracts instead of doing all that effort to get more production ready asap.\n\nEach time spotprice nears or is under the long term price, much more buyers of uranium in spot will appear\n\nAnd we know that the global uranium sector is in a structural global deficit that can't be solved in 12 months time...\n\nI'm strongly bullish for the uranium price in upcoming high season\n\nThe uranium price increase in 2H 2023 was a preview of a more important upward pressure on the uranium price in 2H 2024 (because inventory X is depleted)\n\n**Bonus for the investor:** During the low season the discount over NAV of physical uranium funds, like Yellow Cake (YCA) become bigger, while in the uranium high season those discount become much smaller and even sometimes become premiums over NAV\n\nHere what happened in the last part of the low season in 2023 (August 2023) with Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN, another physical uranium vehicle like YCA):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxw0o8sioxjd1.jpg?width=1353&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d78339aa0c1235da05f8f18ad6cde7d12659ec1\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN) today:\n\n[Source: Sprott website](https://preview.redd.it/qa79ashpoxjd1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=07b120a1d2f2eb452da1b8b24045a53dad05463b)\n\n\n\nNote 1: I post this now (end of low season), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season\n\nNote 2: I'm currently increasing my uranium sector exposure in preparation for the upcoming high season in the sector\n\n**This isn't financial advice.

The Sensex fell by 931 points (-1.15%), meanwhile the Nifty dropped by 311.40 points (-1.26%). With 36 of the 50 stocks in the index trading in the red, BEL and Tata Motors were notable losers, although gains in ICICI Bank, Infosys, and Reliance Industries offered some support.\n\n  \nThe market decline is driven by fears of a U.S. recession, escalating geopolitical tensions, weak corporate earnings, and concerns about stock overvaluation. Investors are engaging in profit booking, while Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have been selling shares amid global uncertainty. Additionally, SEBI's new regulatory changes on derivatives trading, rising crude oil prices, and concerns over upcoming U.S. economic data are adding to market volatility. Together, these factors are contributing to the downturn, prompting a cautious approach from investors.\n\nSource: [Times Now](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/markets/market-slump-sensex-tumbles-nifty-nosedives-as-hyundai-falters-on-ipo-article-114448735)",

I would also like to know what is my net as well as annualized gain/loss to see how am I doing. Is that what you look at too?\n\nI mean, it is hard to remember how many and what price you purchased each stock at, and how many you have already sold.

The company claims to post 30%+ profits annually from basmati rice trading, outperforming industry leaders like LT Foods (Dawat) and KRBL (India Gate), which struggle to reach 10% margins. However, searching for Mishtann basmati mostly brings up stock-pumping YouTube videos, with little evidence of actual rice trading. Interestingly, the company was a cement firm (HICS) until 2015, not a rice trader since 1981 as claimed. Recently, they appointed Rashmika Mandanna as their brand ambassador, as per a SEBI circular, which adds to the confusion. So, the real question is\u2014have you ever eaten this rice? #MISHTANN",

Then there's instability on shareholding and not to mention promoters have sold 5% of their stake over the last quarter. Why'd they do that? FIIs are holding 5% though but no DIIs.

This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3.

Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

I mean whatever growth you are looking, I think you can get a lot more by other fmcg shares rather than nestle and tata consumer. LT foods is nice bet which if goes well can make you good returns but still one strong fundamental that I would look for is itc. I know very controversial and many don't like it but the demerger will improve their balance sheet. Their current return on assets will improve too, since the current balance sheet contains huge capex of their hotel business too so we can evaluate better once the demerger happens. \n\nTata consumer isn't bad stock either but at current levels or recent levels it is over valued and not sure how much returns expected from here. VBL is amazing buy!   \nAnd Asian paints, margins will suffer for sure moving ahead and even I was holding it at good levels but I moved out from it and invested same amount in some other stock which is growing at faster rate. \n\nMy main focus is on stock should not be that large that growth is minimal, I know risk should be managed too but still. That is just my perspective, everyone have their own style and I respect each one of the view as long as it has rationale behind it. \n\nGood luck, would be happy to answer any questions if any",

My multi baggers included newgen software oracle and LT. Since I had close to 60 stocks in portfolio I eventually decided to liquidate the entire portfolio and start a fresh. I have read about stock scans and also attended a few coaching sessions but still I don't have the grip over things. I recently watched the movie dumb money and was super excited about redit as a platform to actually learn stock market investing. I have a capital of about 5 lakhs now to invest. It will be massive if you guys could share your valuable input. Thanks!",

        "selftext": "Today marks the end of Q1 of 2024-25. It was a good roller coaster ride during these two months. Honestly, I expected more from me but I think I should look at the brighter side. When I say more, I mean I was expecting more profits from me but in such high volatility, I didn't give a single rupee in losses. Of course, I did make some bad decisions like IOC and LT but overall these were positive months. \n\nThis Q1 I made a 25.2% return on my capital. Umm, it's good, but it's lower than my past performances. I saw huge running losses this Q1 (first time) but thanks to the guidance from the universe and my knowledge so far, I escaped almost all of it and didn't have to book any. This is the highlight of this quarter.\n\nInteresting this is, that I joined the Reddit community this quarter only and have been enjoying the fun conversations here. Another highlight of the Q. \n\nAnyway, how did you all do and what were your learnings through this Q1? Ready for the next Q?",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter the succes my previous post 26days ago had: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1exf5vm/china\\_just\\_approved\\_the\\_construction\\_of\\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1exf5vm/china_just_approved_the_construction_of_an/)\n\nHere new important events in the sector:\n\n**A.** Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond\n\n[Source: Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/v9t3q5gtr1pd1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a74027b088ccb242881c59a9f0ad19ad0549164)\n\nAbout the subsoil Use agreements that are about to be adapte to a lower production level:\n\n[Source: Kazatomprom \\(Kazakhstan\\)](https://preview.redd.it/0u3fbqfyr1pd1.jpg?width=881&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc1a4ecf1bb2561843165c053d01653c81ce757f)\n\nHere are the production figures of 2022 (not updated yet, numbers of 2023 not yet added here):\n\n[Source: World Nuclear Association](https://preview.redd.it/cp6g9j8or1pd1.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6692f84101f7ceb19c57f2fec9b4dcb68aaa9941)\n\n**Problem is that:**\n\na) Kazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge. Actually when comparing with the oil sector, Kazakhstan is more like Saudi Arabia, Russia and USA combined, because Saudi Arabia produced 11% of world oil production in 2023, Russia also 11% and USA 22%.\n\nb) The production of 2025-2028 was already fully allocated to clients! Meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or Kazatomprom & JV partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket. But from whom exactly?\n\nAll the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce (They are all short uranium). Cause: Many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing LT contracts that had that option integrated in the contract, forcing producers to supply more uranium. But those uranium producers aren't able increase their production that way.\n\nc) The biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is Uranium One. And 100% of uranium of Uranium One comes from? ... well from Kazakhstan!\n\nConclusion:\n\n**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce (Because they are forced to by their clients through existing LT contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients)**. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.\n\nAnd the less they deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket.\n\nThere is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy more uranium in the spotmarket.\n\nAnd that while uranium demand is price INelastic!\n\nAnd before that announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:\n\n[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world](https://preview.redd.it/hx8zmmr4s1pd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ee7610264bc59a394d2b28d1762780771450730)\n\n**B.** September 10th, 2024: Kazakhstan starting to tell western utilities that they will get less uranium supply then they hoped.\n\n[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/axnam2pcs1pd1.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e15f3e1ad905cf173639fa62a6f9d73aadf2da0d)\n\n**C.** September 11th, 2024: Putin suggesting to restrict uranium supply to the West\n\n[Source: Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/eud7thkos1pd1.jpg?width=986&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6cd7eede70976216e12e5dc71ac767c970ec85fe)\n\nThis threat is sufficient for western utilities to lose the last perception of security of uranium supply\n\nRussia is an important supplier of uranium and even more of enriched uranium for Europe and USA.\n\nThe possible loss of Russian enriched uranium supply is actually a bigger problem, because Russia is responsible for \\~40% of world enrichment services. The biggest part of uranium from Kazakhstan and Russia for Europe and USA is first enriched in Russia.\n\nUranium to Europe:\n\n[Source: Euratom](https://preview.redd.it/3hqxuwqus1pd1.jpg?width=919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cebb02a489cb576252e2098d2c7936b2bc42cd3)\n\nUranium to USA:\n\n[Source: EIA](https://preview.redd.it/4dd56nqxs1pd1.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ddc5a7f641040279b07591c26645d3e8db8bf64)\n\nAnd besides that. There are 2 routes for uranium from Kazakhstan to the West: the Saint-Petersburg route and the Caspian route\n\nBut Kazaktomprom just said a day earlier that the Caspian route was much more costely and that the supply of uranium to the West has become very difficult (point B.)\n\nWhen looking at the numbers, this threat is an electroshock for Western utilities (USA, Europe, South Korea, Japan)\n\nUtilities will assess this additional news now, and most probably accelerate and increase the uranium purchases in coming weeks and months in preparation for possible export restrictions by Russia for uranium.\n\nIn terms of revenue, uranium and enriched uranium revenues are significantly smaller than their oil and gas revenues.\n\nImportant comment: The uranium spotmarket is not like the copper, gold, oil market.\n\na) The uranium spotmarkte is an iliquid market. Sometimes you don't have a transaction for a couple days, so an uranium spotprice not moving each day in the low season is normal. In the high season the number of transactions increase in the uranium spotmarket.\n\nb) The uranium spotmarket doesn't react instantly on news, like a liquid copper, gold, oil market does. In the uranium sector the few actors with access to the uranium spotmarket take their time to analyse data before starting to act.\n\n**D.** A couple investment options\n\n**Yellow Cake** (YCA on London stock exchange) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.:\n\n* With a YCA share price of 5.30 GBP/sh (current YCA price) we buy uranium at 67.85 USD/lb, while the uranium spotprice is at 79.50 USD/lb and LT uranium price of 81 USD/lb\n* a YCA share price of 7.80 GBP/sh represents uranium at 100 USD/lb\n* a YCA share price of 9.35 GBP/sh represents uranium at 120 USD/lb\n* a YCA share price of 11.75 GBP/sh represents uranium at 150 USD/lb\n\n**Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/14kbpdfgt1pd1.png?width=481&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c90775af9655552c5a9e45fed678e3d04afae82\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust website: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust is trading at a discount to NAV at the moment. Imo, not for long anymore.\n\nA share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at \\~23.75 CAD/share or \\~17.50 USD/sh gives you a discount to NAV of 11.20 %\n\nAn uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \\~40.00 CAD/sh or \\~29.60 USD/sh.\n\nAnd with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\n\n**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:\n\n* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in uranium sector\n* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNM.L): 100% invested in uranium sector\n* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNP.L): 100% invested in uranium sector\n* Geiger Counter Limited (GCL.L): 100% invested in uranium sector\n\nNote 1: I post this now (at the gradual start of high season in the uranium sector), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector. We are now gradually entering the high season again. Previous 2 weeks were calm, because everyone of the uranium and nuclear industry was at the World Nuclear Symposium in London (September 4th - 6th, 2024), and the week after the utilities started assessing all the new information they got from Kazakhstan, Russia and the WNA Symposium. Now they are analysing the market again and prepare for uranium purchases in coming weeks and months.\n\n**This isn't financial advice. Please do your own due diligence before investing**\n\nCheers",

                "body": "Great start to investing with a capital of Rs. 1 lakh.  \nHowever, I find 2 things contrasting in your query:\n\n1. You want a bunch of people on reddit to recommend stocks, it may serve you well just because of the luck factor but this isn't a sustainable approach. I'd recommend doing your own research, put in the hard work and then make at the most 2 informed picks. You will feel a sense of accountability with the results you get but most importantly you will learn more about the research process, the macro picture currently influencing the market and the sectors that may emerge strong. There is a high possibility that you will come out wiser through this approach. \n\n2. If your holding period is 3-6 months, fundamentals do not matter, in fact I would question if stocks is even an avenue to consider. I would rather park it in a short term liquid fund if I'd need the capital in 3-6 months.\n\nAs Charlie Munger aptly puts it, never interrupt compounding unnecessarily.\n\nIf you do not need the capital, let it do its work for the coming 20-25-30 years, you will be pleasantly surprised how much this can grow into. However, if your need for capital is immediate in the next 6 months, do not invest in the markets. You will also attract STCG in case you make any gains.\n\nJust my 2 cents to your query. I hope it helps you.",

Car manufacturers, airlines, Furniture retailers, clothing, hotels & restaurants etc, do good when the economy is doing good (Higher consumer spending). So during difficult times like Recession these stocks see decline in sales, while Counter/Anti cyclical stocks like FMCG, LPG, Power etc, give good returns during tough times; You can observe that many Power stocks have performed very well in last 2-3 years, like one of my friend bought Coal India for 181 in July 2022 and it tripled up in 2 years. In short, these are High risk, High reward stocks where entry and exit price matters the most, so a blend of both Cyclical/Counter(defensive) stocks with calculated entry-exit price can give good returns, yet i'd suggest to pick stocks with good fundamentals (Sales might vary according to different economic periods) so that it can be safe to hold it for little long if it doesn't move as expected.",

The company claims to post 30%+ profits annually from basmati rice trading, outperforming industry leaders like LT Foods (Dawat) and KRBL (India Gate), which struggle to reach 10% margins. However, searching for Mishtann basmati mostly brings up stock-pumping YouTube videos, with little evidence of actual rice trading. Interestingly, the company was a cement firm (HICS) until 2015, not a rice trader since 1981 as claimed. Recently, they appointed Rashmika Mandanna as their brand ambassador, as per a SEBI circular, which adds to the confusion. So, the real question is\u2014have you ever eaten this rice? #MISHTANN\n\nIntention of this post is simple. I'm interested to invest in this stock. But I am unable to find a single customer who has ever used this product. ",

        "title": "What is happening in the uranium sector? + Break out of uranium price starting now (2 triggers) + uranium spot and LT price just started to increase ",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n**A summery of a couple important points**\n\nThe uranium sector is in a growing global uranium supply deficit that can't be solved in a couple of years time, while:\n\n* recently the biggest uranium producing country of the world, Kazakhstan, made a 17% cut in the previously promised production level for 2025 and also hinting on lower production levels for 2026 and beyond than previously hoped.\n* followed by additional production cuts from other uranium producers (Uranium mining is hard)\n* recently Putin started the threat of soon restricting uranium deliveries to the West, meaning Russian uranium, Russian enriched uranium, uranium from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan that goes through Russia to the port of Saint Petersburg.\n* followed by Kazatomprom (Kazakhstan) stating that uranium deliveries to the West has become difficult and could become even more difficult in the future (--> Putin's threat)\n* Microsoft paying for 100% of electricity from the Three Mile Island reactor they asked Constellation to restart in 2028 = That's unexpected additional uranium demand for delivery in 2025.\n* Uranium demand is price inelastic\n* The inventory created in 2011-2017 (when uranium sector was in oversupply) that helped to solve the structural global deficit starting early 2018, is now depleted! (Confirmed by UxC)\n\n**A couple points more in detail:**\n\n**A.** There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.\n\nLet me explain\n\na) The gas price represents \\~70% of total production cost of electricity coming from a gas-fired power plant. So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!\n\nThe uranium price only represents \\~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105\n\nb) the uranium spotprice is only for supply adjustments, while the main part of the uranium supply goes through LT contracts. So when an uranium consumer needs 50k lb uranium through a spot purchase in addition to the 450k lbs they got through an existing LT contract to be able to start the nuclear fuel rods fabrication, than they will just buy those 50k lb at any price, because blocking the start of the nuclear fuel rods fabrication is not an option.\n\nc) buying uranium (example: 50k lb) at 150 USD/lb through the spotmarket, doesn't mean they need to buy 100% of their uranium needs at 150 USD/lb (example: 100% is 500k lb)\n\nThose are the 3 main reasons why **uranium demand is price INelastic**\n\n**B.** The evolution from oversupply in 2011-2017 to a structural global deficit since early 2018 and growing in the future\n\nFrom 2011 till end 2017 the global uranium market was in oversupply which created an uranium inventory X (explained in a detailed 30 pages long report of mine in August 2023 where I calculated the creation of inventory X and the consumption of it starting early 2018)\n\nSince early 2018 the global uranium market is in big structural deficit and this structural deficit will continue for the coming years for different reasons which have been consuming that inventory X\n\nBut now that inventory X is mathematically depleted. In previous high season (September 2023 - March 2024) we saw the first impact of that nearing depletion with the uranium spotprice going from 56 USD/lb in August 2023 to 106 USD/lb early February 2024\n\nA good month ago a non-US utility went semi-public by sending an email to different uranium stakeholders in the world because they couldn't find 300,000 lb of uranium for delivery in October 2024. Not a surprise because inventory X is depleted now, and there aren't enough idle uranium productions left in the world to close the supply gap. And those few idle production capacities will take years to get back online.\n\n300,000lb is not even enough to run one 1000 Mwe reactor for 1 year! The total global operational nuclear fleet capacity today is 395,388 Mwe\n\nSo now that that inventory X is depleted, the structural global uranium deficit has to be solved with a lot of new production that is't available.\n\nHow come?\n\nDuring 2011-2020 not enough was invested in exploration and development of new uranium deposits, while existing uranium mines are nearing depletion.\n\nAn example: The biggest uranium project in the world is Arrow in Canada, but that projects needs at least 4 years of construction before it can produce the first pound of uranium, and the greenlight for the construction start hasn't been given yet.\n\nThe production start of other smaller uranium projects have been postponed:\n\n* Dasa: postponed by 1 year from early 2025 to early 2026\n* Phoenix: postponed by at least 2 years from 2025 to 2027 at the earliest\n\nWhile producers are producing less than hopped: the majors Cameco, Kazaktomprom, Orano, CGN, Uranium One, ... but also Paladin Energy (2.5Mlb instead of 3.2Mlb planned for 2024), UR-Energy, ...\n\nAnd at the demand side, the last 3+ years a lot of uranium reactors licences have been extended by an additional 20 years and even some by an additional 40 years. But that's a lot of unexpected additional uranium demand that the uranium sector haven't prepared for.\n\n**C.** A couple weeks ago Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond\n\n[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/v6ecworsutud1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0965b6668f1383292afe46f75892cbaee2c6f64a)\n\nAbout the subsoil Use agreements that are about to be adapte to a lower production level:\n\n[Source: Kazatomprom \\(Kazakhstan\\)](https://preview.redd.it/jqtenv3zutud1.jpg?width=881&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06b2a48926558ae899ef0a50b929a2fcbb450d2a)\n\nHere are the production figures of 2022 (not updated yet, numbers of 2023 not yet added here):\n\n[Source: World Nuclear Association](https://preview.redd.it/cocfyz02vtud1.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95ccf250c87bd01e5fa18d2b379e5b980007c93c)\n\n**Problem is that:**\n\na) Kazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge. Actually when comparing with the oil sector, Kazakhstan is more like Saudi Arabia, Russia and USA combined, because Saudi Arabia produced 11% of world oil production in 2023, Russia also 11% and USA 22%.\n\nb) The production of 2025-2028 was already fully allocated to clients! Meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or Kazatomprom & JV partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket. But from whom exactly?\n\nAll the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce (They are all short uranium). Cause: Many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing LT contracts that had that option integrated in the contract, forcing producers to supply more uranium. But those uranium producers aren't able increase their production that way.\n\nc) The biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is Uranium One. And 100% of uranium of Uranium One comes from? ... well from Kazakhstan!\n\nConclusion:\n\n**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce (Because they are forced to by their clients through existing LT contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients)**. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.\n\nAnd the less they deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket.\n\nThere is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy more uranium in the spotmarket.\n\nAnd that while uranium demand is price INelastic!\n\nAnd before that announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:\n\n[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world](https://preview.redd.it/ja3az2o6vtud1.jpg?width=534&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbf890af6211497796c364f0d8208802123d995d)\n\nWith all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last couple of weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\n\nWe are at the beginning of the high season in the uranium sector.\n\n**D.** On Sunday: The Zuuvch uranium mine of Orano is delayed by at least 2 years!\n\nThis was an important uranium project.\n\nThat's a loss of 14Mlb! (2\\*7Mlb/y)\n\n[Source: @z\\_axis\\_capital on X \\(twitter\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gcf2z6c9vtud1.jpg?width=954&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=541747caaad8159f4e0e98924b44b86b47b2ce8a)\n\nOrano is a major uranium producers. They have a serious problem.\n\nThey lost uranium production in Niger in 2023/2024, they lost the Imouraren uranium project in Niger in 2024, and now this delay in production start of Zuuvch uranium mine.\n\nOrano already had to buy uranium in the spotmarket to be able to honor their supply commitements. But now they will have to buy even more in the very tight uranium spotmarket\n\n**E. 2 triggers (=> Break out of uranium price starting now imo)**\n\na) On October 1st the new uranium purchase budgets of US utilities will be released.\n\nWith all latest announcements (big production cuts from Kazakhstan, uranium supply warning from Kazatomprom, Putin's threat on restricting uranium supply to the West, UxC confirming that inventory X is now depleted, additional announcements of lower uranium production from other uranium suppliers the last week, ...), those new budgets will be significantly bigger than the previous ones.\n\nb) The last \\~6 months LT contracting has been largely postponed by utilities (only \\~40Mlb contracted so far) due to uncertainties they first wanted to have clarity on.\n\nNow there is more clarity. By consequence they will now accelerate the LT contracting and uranium buying\n\nThe upward pressure on the uranium spot and LT price is about to increase significantly\n\nOn October 2nd we got the first information of a lot of RFP's being launched!\n\n**F. LT uranium supply contracts signed today are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**\n\nAlthough the uranium spotprice is the price most investors look at, in the sector most of the uranium is delivered through LT contracts using a combination of LT price escalated to inflation and spot related price at the time of delivery.\n\nHere the evolution of the LT uranium price:\n\n[Source: Cameco](https://preview.redd.it/m1amt6ecvtud1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cef116f249f054677790437866bd70750e9fb852)\n\nThe global uranium shortage is structural and can't be solved in a couple of years time, not even when the uranium price would significantly increase from here, because the problem is the needed time to explore, develop and build a lot of new mines!\n\nDuring the low season (around March till around September) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price weakens and the uranium spot price goes a bit down to be closer to the LT uranium price.\n\nIn the high season (around September till around March) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price increases again and the uranium spot price goes back up faster than the month over month price increase of the LT uranium price\n\nThe official LT price is update once a month at the end of the month.\n\n**LT uranium supply contracts signed today (September) are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**\n\n=> an average of 105 USD/lb\n\nWhile the uranium LT price of end August 2024 was 81 USD/lb. Today TradeTech announced a new uranium LT price of 82 USD/lb, while Cameco announces a 81.5 LT uranium price of end September 2024.\n\nBy consequence there is a high probability that not only the uranium spotprice will increase faster coming weeks with activity picking up in the sector, but also that uranium LT price is going to jump higher in coming months compared to the 81.5 USD/lb of end September 2024.\n\nHere is a fragment of a report of Cantor Fitzgerald written before the Kazak uranium supply warning, before the uranium supply threat from Putin, and before the additional cuts in 2024 productions from other uramium suppliers:\n\n[Source: Cantor Fitzgerald, posted by John Quakes on X \\(twitter\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7jjtrpyevtud1.jpg?width=528&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3632ab79002d3000f07688d79041f44532b9d834)\n\n**G. Russia is preparing a long list of export curbs**\n\nAfter the announcement of the huge (17%) cut in the planned production for 2025 and beyond of the biggest uranium producer of the world (Kazakhstan: \\~45% of world production), now Putin asked his people to look into the possibilities to restrict some commodities export to the Western countries, explicitely mentioning uranium\n\n[https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm](https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm)\n\n**H. The uranium spot price increase that slowely started a week ago is now accelerating (some stakeholders have been frontrunning the 2 triggers starting now)**\n\nAlthough the uranium LT price is much more important for the sector, most investors look at the uranium spotprice.\n\nUranium spotprice increase recently:\n\n[Source: Numerco website](https://preview.redd.it/awcel6govtud1.jpg?width=607&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dd7780804af0e4fde0fe1e4581c8c30aee979a7)\n\n**The ingredients for a uraniumsqueeze in the spotmarket are present**\n\nWhat happens when uranium spotbuying increases, while the pounds of uranium available for spotselling decrease?\n\nCauses:\n\na) Uranium One (100% production from Kazakhstan) producing less uranium than previously hoped by many (Utilities, Intermediaries, other producers). So less primary production to sell in spot\n\nb) Inventory X, created in 2011-2017 that solved the annual primary deficit since early 2018, is now mathematically depleted. (Confirmed by UxC)\n\nc) Utilities and Intermediaries increasing their minimum operational inventory levels due to the growing uranium supply insecurity => With supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others\n\nInvestors underestimate the impact of Russian threat alone. The threat alone (without effectively going through with it) is sufficient for utilities to go from supply security to supply insecurity.\n\nUtilities and Intermediaries trade uranium between each other. But with supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others\n\n**The last commercially available lbs will become unavailable before even being sold!** => Consequence: soon potential squeeze in spot\n\nBreak out higher of the uranium price is inevitable\n\nAnd if Putin goes through with his threat, than the squeeze will be very big, knowing that uranium demand is price inelastic.\n\n**I. A couple investment possibilities**\n\n**Yellow Cake** (YCA on London stock exchange) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). **Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.**:\n\n* With a YCA share price of 5.87 GBP/sh we buy uranium at \\~75.69 USD/lb, while the uranium spotprice is at 83.50 USD/lb and LT uranium price of 81.5 USD/lb\n* a YCA share price of 7.75 GBP/sh represents uranium at 100 USD/lb\n* a YCA share price of 9.30 GBP/sh represents uranium at 120 USD/lb\n* a YCA share price of 11.65 GBP/sh represents uranium at 150 USD/lb\n\nAnd with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\n\n**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:\n\n* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in uranium sector\n* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNM.L): 100% invested in uranium sector\n* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNP.L): 100% invested in uranium sector\n* Geiger Counter Limited (GCL.L): 100% invested in uranium sector\n* Betashares Global Uranium ETF (URNM on ASX): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector\n\nA couple individual uranium companies:\n\n**Cameco** (CCJ on NYSE / CCO on TSX)\n\n**Paladin Energy** (PDN on ASX) is significantly cheaper than Cameco and Paladin Energy doesn't have the construction/design risk of Cameco. Once Paladin Energy will be listed in the TSX (in coming weeks), I expect Paladin Energy to catch up to the valuation of TSX and NYSE listed uranium peers like Cameco, UR-Energy, Energy Fuels, ...\n\nThe shareholders of Fission Uranium Corp that has one of the highest grades well advanced Triple R deposit in the world (Canada) approved the takeover by Paladin Energy. And yesterday, the court also approved the takeover.\n\nPaladin Energy and Fission Uranium Corp company combined will be a beast (Cash inflows from Langer Heinrich to finance the construction of Triple R), yet Paladin Energy and Fission Uranium Corp today are significantly cheaper on a EV/lb basis than respectively CCJ and NXE today.\n\n**Deep Yellow** (DYL on ASX) and **Bannerman Energy** (BMN on ASX) have both beautiful projects and are very cheap on a EV/lb basis compared to peers like NXE, DNN, FCU, while both DYL and BMN have a lot of cash on their bank account today.\n\n**Boss Energy** (BOE on ASX): uranium producers 100% owner of Honeymoon uranium mine and 30% owner of Alta Mesa\n\n**This isn't financial advice. Please do your own due diligence before investing**\n\nCheers",

This remains a red flag, as negative or zero cash flow can indicate financial instability. However, compared to its competitor, Avanti Feeds, LT Foods' net cash flow is healthier.\nDebtor Days: The number of debtor days is reducing, indicating improved collection efficiency.\nInventory Days: Inventory days have slightly increased.\nDays Payable: Days payable has increased.\nCash Conversion Cycle: The cash conversion cycle is reducing, which is a positive sign.\nReturn on Capital Employed (ROCE): ROCE has increased, indicating better efficiency in using capital.\n\nOverview: \n\nRevenue and Profit Growth:\nSales Growth:\n5-Year Average Growth: 14.8%\n3-Year Average Growth: 17.9%Profit Growth:\n5-Year Average Growth: 35.9%\n3-Year Average Growth: 29.4%\n LT Foods has shown consistent growth in both sales and profits over different time frames, with a notable improvement in performance from FY22 onwards.\n\nProfitability Metrics:\n\nEBITDA Growth: The company\u2019s EBITDA has consistently grown, reflecting its improving operational efficiency.\n\nOperating Profit Margin (OPM): The OPM has shown a positive trend, indicating effective cost management and pricing strategies.\n\nPAT and EPS Growth: The PAT and EPS have grown consistently, underscoring the company\u2019s ability to translate revenue growth into bottom-line profitability.\n\nDebt and Financial Risk Profile: \n\nDebt Reduction: LT Foods has actively reduced its debt, thereby improving its financial and credit risk profile. \n\nCredit Rating: CRISIL has upgraded the company\u2019s credit rating, reflecting increased confidence in its financial stability and future performance.\n\nNet Debt: Despite having high net debt, it is considered feasible within the industry context, as the basmati rice industry typically requires high inventory holding due to the aging process of paddy, which lasts 12 to 24 months.\n\nCurrent Ratio: With a current ratio of around 1.6, the company is unlikely to face difficulties in meeting its short-term liabilities, indicating good liquidity management.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n LT Foods has demonstrated strong and consistent financial performance over the past years, with robust growth in sales and profits. The company\u2019s strategic initiatives to reduce debt and improve its credit profile have been recognized by CRISIL\u2019s rating upgrade. Although the industry necessitates high inventory holding and debt, LT Foods manages these factors effectively, maintaining a healthy current ratio and a feasible debt level relative to the industry standards. Overall, the financial outlook for LT Foods appears positive, with continued growth and stability expected.\n\n**Financial Performance and GrowthRevenue Growth:**\n\nOverall revenue grew by 12% year-over-year.\n\nSegment Growth: Basmati and other rice segments grew by 17%.\n\nReady-to-eat and ready-to-cook products grew by 23%.\n\nMarket Share: In India, the market share stands at 30% with a volume growth of 11%.Consumer Growth:Household consumer numbers increased by 11%.In the US, consumers of Royal products grew by 30.8%.The Jasmine rice segment in the US grew by 15%.\n\n**Management Discussion and AnalysisGrowth Expectations:**\n\n Management is optimistic about achieving double-digit growth.\nDistribution Expansion: The company plans to increase its focus on distribution to reach more outlets.\nDemand Outlook: Management has a positive outlook on demand.\nDigital Capabilities: Investment in digital capabilities will be a priority.\nProduct Focus: There will be a strong focus on expanding the ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook segments, particularly in the US market.\nCapital Expenditure: The company has announced a \u20b9200 crore CAPEX investment aimed at expanding its digital infrastructure.\n\n**Challenges**\n\nImpact on Margins: The company is facing margin pressure due to the Red Sea crisis, as noted in the management discussion.\n\n**Red Flags**\n\nOverall, the company is performing well across various aspects and remains stable, especially when compared to its competitors and peers. \nHowever, two notable red flags are:\n\nPromoter Holding: The promoter holding in the company is relatively low. Moreover, it has decreased from 56.82% to 51%, which could indicate potential concerns about the promoters' confidence in the company\u2019s future prospects.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nI am a student currently learning company analysis and investment research.

Do they monitor broker's data  against tax returns? And if I explain the one-to-one correspondence of  trades (e.g. old holdings are 1748 shares, trade is clear buy 100 shares  sell 100 shares), what are the chances they will accept?\n\nThanks!",

The dividend yield is also pretty impressive. Though it is a very old enterprise, I still believe that it has potential to grow and deliver decent returns. I hope the proposed demerger unlocks wealthy to investor.\n\nTips Industries Limited is a cash rich company that rewards regularly by way of dividends and buy-backs. The music industry is growing and people have started to pay for streaming it. There is some stability in revenues as the company has minimum guarantee deals with global record labels. By demerging the films division, the risk is transferred to the new company, making music the core business for the company. I also think their accounting practices are conservative as 100% costs are written-off in the year of release, thereby keeping the balance sheet light weight.\n\nPNGSGFJ Limited is by far the riskiest amongst the three. It is still a relatively small and new company (market capitalization is less than \u20b91,000 crores), yet poised for growth. The name P.N. Gadgil & Sons is a symbol of excellence and trust. The company enjoys this brand legacy. The organized jewellery business is slowly taking over mom-and-pop stores. As a society we are experiencing more women participation in the work force. This leaves women with more disposable income that will further boost the jewellery business. This company is rapidly expanding its physical presence across tier 1 cities. Consumers desire affordable, high quality, fashionable accessories and this company checks all the boxes.\n\nI am eager to know your picks for SIP. That's my two cents, thank you.",

        "title": "What is happening in the uranium sector? + Break out of uranium price starting now (2 triggers) + uranium spot and LT price just started to increase ",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n**A summery of a couple important points**\n\nThe uranium sector is in a growing global uranium supply deficit that can't be solved in a couple of years time, while:\n\n* recently the biggest uranium producing country of the world, Kazakhstan, made a 17% cut in the previously promised production level for 2025 and also hinting on lower production levels for 2026 and beyond than previously hoped.\n* followed by additional production cuts from other uranium producers (Uranium mining is hard)\n* recently Putin started the threat of soon restricting uranium deliveries to the West, meaning Russian uranium, Russian enriched uranium, uranium from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan that goes through Russia to the port of Saint Petersburg.\n* followed by Kazatomprom (Kazakhstan) stating that uranium deliveries to the West has become difficult and could become even more difficult in the future (--> Putin's threat)\n* Microsoft paying for 100% of electricity from the Three Mile Island reactor they asked Constellation to restart in 2028 = That's unexpected additional uranium demand for delivery in 2025.\n* Google signing nuclear energy contract with Kairos PowerKairos Power (October 14th, 2024)\n* Amazon goes nuclear, to invest more than $500 million to develop small modular reactorsAmazon goes nuclear, to invest more than $500 million to develop small modular reactors (October 16th, 2024)\n* Uranium demand is price inelastic\n* The inventory created in 2011-2017 (when uranium sector was in oversupply) that helped to solve the structural global deficit starting early 2018, is now depleted! (Confirmed by UxC)\n\n**A couple points more in detail:**\n\n**A.** There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.\n\nLet me explain\n\na) The gas price represents \\~70% of total production cost of electricity coming from a gas-fired power plant. So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!\n\nThe uranium price only represents \\~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105\n\nb) the uranium spotprice is only for supply adjustments, while the main part of the uranium supply goes through LT contracts. So when an uranium consumer needs 50k lb uranium through a spot purchase in addition to the 450k lbs they got through an existing LT contract to be able to start the nuclear fuel rods fabrication, than they will just buy those 50k lb at any price, because blocking the start of the nuclear fuel rods fabrication is not an option.\n\nc) buying uranium (example: 50k lb) at 150 USD/lb through the spotmarket, doesn't mean they need to buy 100% of their uranium needs at 150 USD/lb (example: 100% is 500k lb)\n\nThose are the 3 main reasons why **uranium demand is price INelastic**\n\n**B.** The evolution from oversupply in 2011-2017 to a structural global deficit since early 2018 and growing in the future\n\nFrom 2011 till end 2017 the global uranium market was in oversupply which created an uranium inventory X (explained in a detailed 30 pages long report of mine in August 2023 where I calculated the creation of inventory X and the consumption of it starting early 2018)\n\nSince early 2018 the global uranium market is in big structural deficit and this structural deficit will continue for the coming years for different reasons which have been consuming that inventory X\n\nBut now that inventory X is mathematically depleted. In previous high season (September 2023 - March 2024) we saw the first impact of that nearing depletion with the uranium spotprice going from 56 USD/lb in August 2023 to 106 USD/lb early February 2024\n\nA good month ago a non-US utility went semi-public by sending an email to different uranium stakeholders in the world because they couldn't find 300,000 lb of uranium for delivery in October 2024. Not a surprise because inventory X is depleted now, and there aren't enough idle uranium productions left in the world to close the supply gap. And those few idle production capacities will take years to get back online.\n\n300,000lb is not even enough to run one 1000 Mwe reactor for 1 year! The total global operational nuclear fleet capacity today is 395,388 Mwe\n\nSo now that that inventory X is depleted, the structural global uranium deficit has to be solved with a lot of new production that is't available.\n\nHow come?\n\nDuring 2011-2020 not enough was invested in exploration and development of new uranium deposits, while existing uranium mines are nearing depletion.\n\nAn example: The biggest uranium project in the world is Arrow in Canada, but that projects needs at least 4 years of construction before it can produce the first pound of uranium, and the greenlight for the construction start hasn't been given yet.\n\nThe production start of other smaller uranium projects have been postponed:\n\n* Dasa: postponed by 1 year from early 2025 to early 2026\n* Phoenix: postponed by at least 2 years from 2025 to 2027 at the earliest\n\nWhile producers are producing less than hopped: the majors Cameco, Kazaktomprom, Orano, CGN, Uranium One, ... but also Paladin Energy (2.5Mlb instead of 3.2Mlb planned for 2024), UR-Energy, ...\n\nAnd at the demand side, the last 3+ years a lot of uranium reactors licences have been extended by an additional 20 years and even some by an additional 40 years. But that's a lot of unexpected additional uranium demand that the uranium sector haven't prepared for.\n\n**C.** Recently, Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond\n\n[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/p1r4r8o2gbvd1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4966e48a3ef2a484e7ec40726be933c4483d3f35)\n\nKazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge. Actually when comparing with the oil sector, Kazakhstan is more like Saudi Arabia, Russia and USA combined, because Saudi Arabia produced 11% of world oil production in 2023, Russia also 11% and USA 22%.\n\nHere my previous post explaining this more in detail: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f4usq8/kazatomprom\\_17\\_cut\\_in\\_expected\\_production2025\\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f4usq8/kazatomprom_17_cut_in_expected_production2025_in/)\n\nConclusion of my previous post:\n\n**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce (Because they are forced to by their clients through existing LT contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients)**. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.\n\nAnd the less they deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket.\n\nThere is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy more uranium in the spotmarket.\n\nAnd that while uranium demand is price INelastic!\n\nAnd before that announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:\n\n[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world](https://preview.redd.it/296cyxmggbvd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75a342266e636b38894d9a9d6a4e76d54bb6e917)\n\nWith all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last couple of weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\n\nWe are at the beginning of the high season in the uranium sector.\n\n**D.** On Sunday: The Zuuvch uranium mine of Orano is delayed by at least 2 years!\n\nThis was an important uranium project.\n\nThat's a loss of 14Mlb! (2\\*7Mlb/y)\n\n[Source: @z\\_axis\\_capital on X \\(twitter\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xt83g4skgbvd1.jpg?width=954&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c87f248dacacb1030cb7992d892dd35757cfbc3)\n\nOrano is a major uranium producers. They have a serious problem.\n\nThey lost uranium production in Niger in 2023/2024, they lost the Imouraren uranium project in Niger in 2024, and now this delay in production start of Zuuvch uranium mine.\n\nOrano already had to buy uranium in the spotmarket to be able to honor their supply commitements. But now they will have to buy even more in the very tight uranium spotmarket\n\n**E. UR-Energy and Olympic Dam also producing less uranium than promised**\n\n[Source: UR-Energy](https://preview.redd.it/6lyulp7mhbvd1.jpg?width=816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cba60ff5ac957274a5544159219499eef410b833)\n\n[Source: Olympic Dam](https://preview.redd.it/pys6ctc9ibvd1.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=466e0992a03bd1f7000c8e3bee84c974621df551)\n\n**F. 2 triggers (=> Break out of uranium price starting now imo)**\n\na) On October 1st the new uranium purchase budgets of US utilities will be released.\n\nWith all latest announcements (big production cuts from Kazakhstan, uranium supply warning from Kazatomprom, Putin's threat on restricting uranium supply to the West, UxC confirming that inventory X is now depleted, additional announcements of lower uranium production from other uranium suppliers the last week, ...), those new budgets will be significantly bigger than the previous ones.\n\nb) The last \\~6 months LT contracting has been largely postponed by utilities (only \\~40Mlb contracted so far) due to uncertainties they first wanted to have clarity on.\n\nNow there is more clarity. By consequence they will now accelerate the LT contracting and uranium buying\n\nThe upward pressure on the uranium spot and LT price is about to increase significantly\n\nOn October 2nd we got the first information of a lot of RFP's being launched!\n\n**G. LT uranium supply contracts signed today are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**\n\nAlthough the uranium spotprice is the price most investors look at, in the sector most of the uranium is delivered through LT contracts using a combination of LT price escalated to inflation and spot related price at the time of delivery.\n\nHere the evolution of the LT uranium price:\n\n[Source: Cameco](https://preview.redd.it/yr1qk8nngbvd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5296a0df1d8d0edca64ced1306d1f6bae041c307)\n\nThe global uranium shortage is structural and can't be solved in a couple of years time, not even when the uranium price would significantly increase from here, because the problem is the needed time to explore, develop and build a lot of new mines!\n\nDuring the low season (around March till around September) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price weakens and the uranium spot price goes a bit down to be closer to the LT uranium price.\n\nIn the high season (around September till around March) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price increases again and the uranium spot price goes back up faster than the month over month price increase of the LT uranium price\n\nThe official LT price is update once a month at the end of the month.\n\n**LT uranium supply contracts signed today (September) are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**\n\n=> an average of 105 USD/lb\n\nWhile the uranium LT price of end August 2024 was 81 USD/lb. Today TradeTech announced a new uranium LT price of 82 USD/lb, while Cameco announces a 81.5 LT uranium price of end September 2024.\n\nBy consequence there is a high probability that not only the uranium spotprice will increase faster coming weeks with activity picking up in the sector, but also that uranium LT price is going to jump higher in coming months compared to the 81.5 USD/lb of end September 2024.\n\nHere is a fragment of a report of Cantor Fitzgerald written before the Kazak uranium supply warning, before the uranium supply threat from Putin, and before the additional cuts in 2024 productions from other uramium suppliers:\n\n[Source: Cantor Fitzgerald, posted by John Quakes on X \\(twitter\\)](https://preview.redd.it/zjxstfaqgbvd1.jpg?width=528&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f77ac4be79a8d4bf9934ec8db306f24d6e420c98)\n\n**H. Russia is preparing a long list of export curbs**\n\nAfter the announcement of the huge (17%) cut in the planned production for 2025 and beyond of the biggest uranium producer of the world (Kazakhstan: \\~45% of world production), now Putin asked his people to look into the possibilities to restrict some commodities export to the Western countries, explicitely mentioning uranium\n\n[https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm](https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm)\n\n**I. The uranium spot price increase that slowely started 3 weeks ago is now going to accelerate**\n\nAlthough the uranium LT price is much more important for the sector, most investors look at the uranium spotprice.\n\nThe uranium spotprice is now at 83.25 USD/lb\n\n**The ingredients for a uraniumsqueeze in the spotmarket are present**\n\nWhat happens when uranium spotbuying increases, while the pounds of uranium available for spotselling decrease?\n\nCauses:\n\na) Uranium One (100% production from Kazakhstan) producing less uranium than previously hoped by many (Utilities, Intermediaries, other producers). So less primary production to sell in spot\n\nb) Inventory X, created in 2011-2017 that solved the annual primary deficit since early 2018, is now mathematically depleted. (Confirmed by UxC)\n\nc) Utilities and Intermediaries increasing their minimum operational inventory levels due to the growing uranium supply insecurity => With supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others\n\nInvestors underestimate the impact of Russian threat alone. The threat alone (without effectively going through with it) is sufficient for utilities to go from supply security to supply insecurity.\n\nUtilities and Intermediaries trade uranium between each other. But with supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others\n\n**The last commercially available lbs will become unavailable before even being sold!** => Consequence: soon potential squeeze in spot\n\nBreak out higher of the uranium price is inevitable\n\nAnd if Putin goes through with his threat, than the squeeze will be very big, knowing that uranium demand is price inelastic.\n\n**J. A couple investment possibilities**\n\n**Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). **Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.**\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust website: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)\n\nThe uranium LT price just increased to 81.50 USD/lb, while uranium spotprice started to increase the last couple of trading days of previous week.\n\nUranium spotprice is now at 83.25 USD/lb\n\nA share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at 28.14 CAD/share or 20.46 USD/sh represents an uranium price of 83.25 USD/lb\n\nFor instance, before the production cuts announced by Kazakhstan and before Putin's threat too restrict uranium supply to the West, Cantor Fitzgerald estimated that the uranium spotprice will reach 120 USD/lb, 130 USD/lb in 2025 and 140 USD/lb in 2026. Knowing a couple important factors in the sector today (UxC confirming that inventory X is indeed depleted now) find this estimate for 2024/2025 modest, but ok.\n\nAn uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \\~40.50 CAD/sh or \\~29.50 USD/sh.\n\nAnd with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\n\n**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:\n\n* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector\n* Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector\n\nI posting now, in the beginning of the high season in the uranium sector that started in September and that will now hit the accelerator (Oct 1st), and not 2 months later when we will be well in the high season\n\n**This isn't financial advice. Please do your own due diligence before investing**\n\nCheers",

Howell\u2019s Switch is Significant:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Ex-Joby Military Advisor:** Howell\u2019s decision to leave Joby and align with Archer speaks volumes. Joby has stopped or failed to deliver on military-related work, leaving Howell to pivot toward a company he likely sees as having better potential in the defense space.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Military Expertise:** As a former leader of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), Howell brings decades of military experience to Archer. His involvement signals serious intent to position Archer\u2019s eVTOLs for defense applications, including battlefield logistics, search & rescue, and rapid transport.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Credibility Boost for Archer:** Howell's endorsement of Archer over Joby strengthens Archer\u2019s narrative as a leader in both commercial and defense markets. It suggests Archer\u2019s tech and strategy may be better suited to meet the stringent demands of military use.\n\n# What This Could Mean for ACHR Stock:\n\n* **Short-term:** Investors may interpret Howell\u2019s move as a direct vote of confidence in Archer\u2019s ability to deliver where Joby couldn\u2019t, likely leading to increased optimism around ACHR\u2019s stock.\n* **Long-term:** The defense market offers large, multi-year contracts that could add a steady, high-margin revenue stream for Archer. If Howell\u2019s experience and connections can secure key deals, it could significantly bolster the company\u2019s financials.\n\n# My Optimistic Take:\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about one man\u2014it\u2019s about what his shift represents. Joby\u2019s apparent failures in military programs may have opened the door for Archer, and Howell\u2019s decision to join them reinforces the idea that Archer is better positioned to succeed. Combined with their commercial partnerships (like United Airlines), Archer seems to be diversifying intelligently, increasing their chances of dominating the eVTOL race.\n\n**TL;DR:** Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Scott Howell, formerly an advisor to Joby Aviation, has joined Archer\u2019s Defense Advisory Board. His move signals confidence in Archer\u2019s military potential and highlights Joby\u2019s failures in the defense space. This could open new revenue streams and cement Archer as a key player in the eVTOL industry.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on this move? Are we looking at the next big step for ACHR?",

Soon we will entre the high season again\n\nUranium spotprice is close to the long term price again, like in August 2023 (end of low season in 2023), which creates a strong bottom for the uranium price\n\n[Source: Cameco](https://preview.redd.it/li99y80dztjd1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a02a09ca22f9f7c62ccb42dc255ad53f05abcc9)\n\n[Source: Skysurfer75 on X](https://preview.redd.it/2p7rz6wgztjd1.jpg?width=1355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b34fe1a20a4d8e22dc147531ae69f9ceec10162a)\n\n**Why a strong bottom for uranium price?**\n\nBecause it becomes very interesting to buy uranium in spotmarket to sell through existing LT contracts instead of doing all that effort to get more production ready asap.\n\nEach time spotprice nears or is under the long term price, much more buyers of uranium in spot will appear\n\nAnd we know that the global uranium sector is in a structural global deficit that can't be solved in 12 months time...\n\nI'm strongly bullish for the uranium price in upcoming high season\n\nThe uranium price increase in 2H 2023 was a preview of a more important upward pressure on the uranium price in 2H 2024 (because inventory X is depleted)\n\n**Bonus for the investor:** During the low season the discount over NAV of physical uranium funds, like Yellow Cake (YCA) become bigger, while in the uranium high season those discount become much smaller and even sometimes become premiums over NAV\n\nHere what happened in the last part of the low season in 2023 (August 2023) with Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN, another physical uranium vehicle like YCA):\n\n[Source: Skysurfer on X](https://preview.redd.it/j1julrzoztjd1.jpg?width=1353&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0621c1adec79c18a5871bc0cb5331f5229420fa6)\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN) today:\n\n[Source: Sprott website](https://preview.redd.it/9tere1nvztjd1.jpg?width=834&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b34b1cdd486d8c00e320c65b92cadc0c52eb9a76)\n\nYellow Cake (YCA) today:\n\n[Source: Yellow Cake website](https://preview.redd.it/d7oqydqwztjd1.jpg?width=975&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ba9b5ee6e99fe3d4280686a3eab140ccb8a2986)\n\nNote: I post this now (end of low season), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season\n\n**This isn't financial advice.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n**A. 2 triggers**\n\na) Next week the new uranium purchase budgets of US utilities will be released.\n\nWith all latest announcements (big production cuts from Kazakhstan, uranium supply warning from Kazatomprom, Putin's threat on restricting uranium supply to the West, UxC confirming that inventory X is now depleted, additional announcements of lower uranium production from other uranium suppliers the last week, ...), those new budgets will be significantly bigger than the previous ones.\n\nb) The last \\~6 months LT contracting has been largely postponed by utilities (only \\~40Mlb contracted so far) due to uncertainties they first wanted to have clarity on.\n\nNow there is more clarity. By consequence they will now accelerate the LT contracting and uranium buying\n\nToday LT contracts are being signed with a 80 - 85 USD/lb floor and a 125 - 130 USD/lb ceiling escalated with future inflation! This will soon be reflected in significant LT uranium price increases.\n\nThe upward pressure on the uranium price is about to increase significantly\n\nYesterday the uranium spotprice started to move higher after more than a week of no movement, and it just moved higher again now. Now at 80.85 USD/lb.\n\n**B. Uranium mining is hard!**\n\nUR-Energy: The production of uranium in restarting deposits is fraught with difficulties and challenges. Future production will fall short of what the market discounts as certain. Just an example, URG's production will be 43% lower than its first 1Q2024 guidance\n\n[Source: UR-Energy](https://preview.redd.it/gt444v748yqd1.jpg?width=816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91d42c0d3512b5deaf1c297f406cf3fac896ab43)\n\nMe: The available alternatives: deliverying less uranium to the clients than previously promised or buying uranium in spot\n\nBut URG is not alone!\n\nKazakhstan did 17% cut for their promised uranium production2025 + lower production than expected in 2026 & beyond! My previous post explaining this more in detail: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f4usq8/kazatomprom\\_17\\_cut\\_in\\_expected\\_production2025\\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f4usq8/kazatomprom_17_cut_in_expected_production2025_in/)\n\nLanger Heinrich too! \\~2.5Mlb production in 2024, in2023 they promised 3.2Mlb for 2024\n\nDasa delayed by 1y (>4Mlb less for 2025), Phoenix by 2y\n\nPeninsula Energy planned to start production end 2023, but with what UEC dis to PEN, the production of PEN was delayed by a year => Again less pounds in 2024 than initially expected. Peninsula Energy is in the process to restart ISR production end this year.\n\nBOE EU and UUUU (good, cashflow generating, companies) also didn\u2019t reach the amounts of uranium production for Q1, Q2 & Q3 2024 promised in previous years.\n\n**C.** Physical uranium without being exposed to mining related risks\n\n**Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world).

Knowing a couple important factors in the sector today (UxC confirming that inventory X is indeed depleted now) find this estimate for 2024/2025 modest, but ok.\n\nAn uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \\~40.00 CAD/sh or \\~29.50 USD/sh.\n\nAnd with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\n\n**D.** A couple alternatives:\n\n**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:\n\n* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector\n* Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector\n\nHere is a fragment of a report of Cantor Fitzgerald written before the Kazak uranium supply warning, before the uranium supply threat from Putin, and before the additional cuts in 2024 productions from other uramium suppliers:\n\n[Source: Cantor Fitzgerald, posted by John Quakes on X \\(twitter\\)](https://preview.redd.it/s5b94k4k8yqd1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=df034d9e059d9af5d0209af97f1b57b264d40515)\n\nAnd today LT contracts are indeed being signed with a 80 - 85 USD/lb floor and a 125 - 130 USD/lb ceiling escalated with future inflation! => an average price \\~105 USD/lb\n\nThose higher LT prices contracted as we speak will soon be reflected in significant LT uranium price increases.\n\nCameco LT uranium price today:\n\n[Source: Cameco](https://preview.redd.it/o6ujomysayqd1.png?width=1238&format=png&auto=webp&s=4add1b6bb57f9c6c5704bc0a450595f9450a860c)\n\nNote: I post this now at the beginning of the high season in the uranium sector and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector. We are now gradually entering the high season again. Previous 3 weeks were calm, because everyone of the uranium and nuclear industry was at the World Nuclear Symposium in London (September 4th - 6th, 2024), and the 2 weeks after the utilities started assessing all the new information they got from Kazakhstan, Russia and the WNA Symposium. Now they are analysing the market again and prepare for uranium purchases in coming weeks.\n\n**This isn't financial advice. Please do your own due diligence before investing**\n\nCheers",

Looking at the numbers + 1 day earlier: Kazakhstan clearly stating that uranium supply to the West has become very difficult (They are sold out for coming years)",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nFor those interested. No need to rush. Take time to double check the information I'm giving here, before potentially doing something.\n\n**A.** Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond\n\nExplained in more detail in my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f4usq8/kazatomprom\\_17\\_cut\\_in\\_expected\\_production2025\\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f4usq8/kazatomprom_17_cut_in_expected_production2025_in/)\n\nConclusion:\n\nKazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.\n\nBefore the announcement of Kazakhstan on Friday, the global uranium supply problem already looked like this:\n\n[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world](https://preview.redd.it/veiqfmohzjod1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ba80761363fabd5d0ff68a81f0ca1487a7d08ad)\n\n**B.** 3 days ago: Kazakhstan starting to tell western utilities that they will get less uranium supply then they hoped.\n\n[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/8x040xujzjod1.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e1f295dd80d53916e847b1bbf375404fd48bbb3)\n\n**C.** 2 days ago: Putin suggesting to restrict uranium supply to the West\n\n[Source: Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/xzdhhn210kod1.jpg?width=986&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79541378c508ea4f4c8c102625f08f9efb118caf)\n\n\n\nThis threat is sufficient for western utilities to lose the last perception of security of uranium supply\n\nWhy?\n\na) Russia is an important supplier of uranium and even more of enriched uranium for Europe and USA.\n\nThe possible loss of Russian enriched uranium supply is actually a bigger problem, because Russia is responsible for \\~40% of world enrichment services. The biggest part of uranium from Kazakhstan and Russia for Europe and USA is first enriched in Russia.\n\nUranium to Europe:\n\n[Source: Euratom](https://preview.redd.it/sxjme9bnzjod1.jpg?width=919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e09e074d09f21e224f545d6a2e80e8923e738a78)\n\nUranium to USA:\n\n[Source: eia](https://preview.redd.it/94htvzgpzjod1.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=43c135230b07a1f85147a1d56aa3e1ff035d641e)\n\nb) And besides that. There are 2 routes for uranium from Kazakhstan to the West: the Saint-Petersburg route and the Caspian route\n\nAnd because most uranium from Kazakhstan for Europe, USA, Japan and South Korea need to be enriched in Russia, because the West has a shortage in enrichment capacity, the biggest part of Kazak uranium supply to Europe, USA, Japan and South Korea is also threatened.\n\nThere was a reason why Europe was sanctioning oil en gas from Russia and not uranium from Russia!\n\nBut Kazaktomprom just said a day earlier that the Caspian route was much more costely and that the supply of uranium to the West has become very difficult (point B.)\n\nWhen looking at the numbers, this threat is an electroshock for Western utilities (USA, Europe, South Korea, Japan)\n\nUtilities will assess this additional news now, and most probably accelerate and increase the uranium purchases in coming weeks and months in preparation for possible export restrictions by Russia for uranium.\n\nIn terms of revenue, uranium and enriched uranium revenues are significantly smaller than their oil and gas revenues.\n\n\n\n**D.** A couple investment possibilities\n\n**Yellow Cake** (YCA on London stock exchange) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.:\n\n* With a YCA share price of 5.30 GBP/sh (current YCA price) we buy uranium at 67.85 USD/lb, while the uranium spotprice is at 80 USD/lb and LT uranium price of 81 USD/lb\n* a YCA share price of 7.80 GBP/sh represents uranium at 100 USD/lb\n* a YCA share price of 9.35 GBP/sh represents uranium at 120 USD/lb\n* a YCA share price of 11.75 GBP/sh represents uranium at 150 USD/lb\n\n**Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.\n\n[Sprott website](https://preview.redd.it/g20j7vad8kod1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=3df0caf9a5d7a25c64429fca512bd7a86ff20da3)\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust is trading at a discount to NAV at the moment. Imo, not for long anymore.\n\nA share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at \\~24.30 CAD/share or \\~17.95 USD/sh gives you a discount to NAV of 9.00 %\n\nAn uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \\~40.00 CAD/sh or \\~29.60 USD/sh.\n\nAnd with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\n\n**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:\n\n* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector\n* Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector\n* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNM.L): 100% invested in uranium sector\n* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNP.L): 100% invested in uranium sector\n* Geiger Counter Limited (GCL.L): 100% invested in uranium sector\n\n**Uranium Royalty Corp** (URC / UROY): the only Royalty and streaming company in the uranium sector physical uranium and annual uranium deliveries from current productions\n\n  \nNote 1: Uranium demand is price INelastic due to different factors. Utilities don't care if they have to buy some uranium pounds at 80 USD/lb or at 150 USD/lb, as long as they get enough uranium delivered ON TIME.\n\nNote 2: the uranium spotmarkte is an iliquid market. Sometimes you don't have a transaction for a couple days, so an uranium spotprice not moving each day in the low season is normal. In the high season the number of transactions increase in the uranium spotmarket.\n\nNote 3: I post this now (at the beginning of high season in the uranium sector), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector. We are now gradually entering the high season again. Previous week was calm, because everyone of the uranium and nuclear industry was at the World Nuclear Symposium in London (September 4th - 6th, 2024). Now they are coming back to their desk and start to analyse the market again and prepare for uranium purchases in coming weeks and months.\n\n  \nFor those interested. No need to rush. Take time to double check the information I'm giving here, before potentially doing something.\n\n**This isn't financial advice. Please do your own due diligence before investing**\n\nCheers",

Imo, not for long anymore",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nNow that the NVDA earnings are out, and investors can again look beyond that...\n\nAfter my post of 10 days ago ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ewxhyj/china\\_just\\_approved\\_the\\_construction\\_of\\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ewxhyj/china_just_approved_the_construction_of_an/) ), a major production cut for production 2025 and beyond has been announced.\n\nThe uranium sector is in a global structural supply deficit, and now Kazakhstan, responsible for \\~45% of world production, announced a big cut in the hoped uranium production for 2025 and hinted for additional cuts in 2026 and beyond.\n\nA. There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.\n\nLet me explain\n\na) The gas price represents \\~70% of total production cost of electricity coming from a gas-fired power plant. So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!\n\nThe uranium price only represents \\~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105\n\nb) the uranium spotprice is only for supply adjustments, while the main part of the uranium supply goes through LT contracts. So when an uranium consumer needs 50k lb uranium through a spot purchase in addition to the 450k lbs they got through an existing LT contract to be able to start the nuclear fuel rods fabrication, than they will just buy those 50k lb at any price, because blocking the start of the nuclear fuel rods fabrication is not an option.\n\nc) buying uranium (example: 50k lb) at 150 USD/lb through the spotmarket, doesn't mean they need to buy 100% of their uranium needs at 150 USD/lb (example: 100% is 500k lb)\n\nThose are the 3 main reasons why **uranium demand is price INelastic**\n\nUtilities don't care if they have to buy uranium at 80 or 150 USD/lb, as long as they get enough uranium and ON TIME\n\nB. On Friday August 23th, 2024, Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond\n\n[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/h3gc7pngssld1.jpg?width=781&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5840b77e8ae3ecccdd9659ae051f118b8075b278)\n\nAbout the subsoil Use agreements that are about to be adapte to a lower production level:\n\n[Source: Kazatomprom \\(Kazakhstan\\)](https://preview.redd.it/co26valjssld1.jpg?width=881&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=688d15f3b1547ad26ea4a71d69f15315860238bd)\n\nHere are the production figures of 2022 (not updated yet, numbers of 2023 not yet added here):\n\n[Source: World Nuclear Association](https://preview.redd.it/9ux2cj7vssld1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bdb238fbfc7d0df271c9c4748c866e69d5f64f0)\n\n**Problem is that:**\n\na) Kazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge.\n\nb) The production of 2025-2028 was already fully allocated to clients! Meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or Kazatomprom & JV partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket. But from whom exactly?\n\nAll the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce (They are all short uranium). Cause: Many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing LT contracts that had that option integrated in the contract, forcing producers to supply more uranium. But those uranium producers aren't able increase their production that way.\n\nc) The biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is Uranium One. And 100% of uranium of Uranium One comes from? ... well from Kazakhstan!\n\nImportant to keep in mind here is that uranium demand is price INelastic!\n\nConclusion:\n\n**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce (Because they are forced to by their clients through existing LT contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients)**. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.\n\nAnd before that announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:\n\n[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of the 2 sector consultants of all uranium producers and uranium consumers in the world](https://preview.redd.it/wzalrqinssld1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be6e37823aeed9dd8372b8779dd639c3950d6ad2)\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world).  Here the investor is not subjected to mining related risks.\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust website: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)\n\n[Source: Sprott website](https://preview.redd.it/njfccfk9tsld1.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=c89e9fef2fd4961694d03e13ea144c6a55728ded)\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust is trading at a discount to NAV at the moment. Imo, not for long anymore.\n\nA share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at \\~24.25 CAD/share or \\~18.00 USD/sh gives you a discount to NAV of 8.75%\n\nAn uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \\~40.00 CAD/sh or \\~29.75 USD/sh.\n\nAnd with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\n\nUranium sector ETF's:\n\n* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector\n* Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector\n\nWe are at the end of the annual low season in the uranium sector. Next week we will gradually entre the high season again\n\nIn the low season in the uranium sector the activity in the uranium spotmarket is reduced to a minimum which reduces the upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket and the uranium spotprice goes back to the LT uranium price.\n\nIn the high season with an uranium sector being a sellers market (a market where the sellers have the negotiation power) the activity in the uranium spotmarket increases significantly which significantly increases the upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket. Added to that now the announced additional big uranium production cuts.\n\nThe uranium spotprice today:\n\n[Source: Numerco](https://preview.redd.it/13zbtfoiusld1.png?width=545&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d6931ed2a7c46f6b1ca44aded7cdf5ad03c52fe)\n\nThe long term price goes up month after month:\n\n[Source: Cameco](https://preview.redd.it/ikb6pm3susld1.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=44a953a9f52669fc2e45efe58455df347ce2ded8)\n\nNote: I post this now (at the very end of low season in the uranium sector), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector.\n\n**This isn't financial advice.

        "selftext": "Reddit wouldn't let me make a formatted comment in a comment thread on another post so I figured I'd just make a post and link to it in that other thread.\n\nWhen a company pays a dividend, there is an extra, artificial price move in the dividend paying stock because of the payment of the dividend.  If you assume two stocks that have the same market moves and you assume reinvestment for the div. paying stock, the two stocks turn out exactly the same, except the person who received and reinvested the dividend is worse off because they pay some taxes (either ST or LT gains) on the distribution.\n\nLet's do some math.  Option 1 will be the stock that pays a dividend, option two will be the stock that doesn't.  The only difference is that the dividend paying stock has an extra price decline exactly equal to the price of the dividend.  You can google it and it is well established that the effect of a, e.g., 1% share price dividend is equal to a 1% decrease in share price on or around the ex dividend date.  Here's [a Fidelity article explaining it in more detail](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/stocks/why-dividends-matter).  In the real world, it can be hard to see this clearly because stock prices move all day for various reasons.  Perhaps the stock is down 2% on ex div. day because the company had bad news that contributed an additional 1% drop.  Perhaps it's up 5% because the company had good news that contributed a *6% rise*, but the dividend brings the closing price down to 5%.  In the examples below, we'll assume prices only change once per day or w/e--that part's not important.  The important part is that each stock experiences the same exact market forces, and at the end, except for the taxes paid by the dividend investor, the two situations are equal.\n\n# Dividend Paying - Person A\n\n* **1 share of stock is worth $120**, pays a dividend of $30, a **25% dividend** (to make the math easier).\n* Person has **1 share at $90** *and $30 cash*.\n   * The price of the stock has gone down to **$90/share**, not because of market forces, but because that's how dividend distributions are priced in.\n* Person reinvests and now has **1.33333 shares worth $120**\n   * (not really,  but lets ignore the taxes for now).\n* The stock goes down because of market forces.   Perhaps the CEO of the company becomes a senior member of the government and people don't like what he's doing, so they tank his stock.\n   * It goes down **33.3333%** (1/3--assume repeating decimals are infinite) % **to $60 per share**, so the person has **1.33333 shares worth $80**\n* The **stock doubles**, going back up to **$120/share**.  The person has **1.33333 shares worth $160.**\n   * But again, not really, because the person will pay taxes on the $30 dividend.\n\n# Non-Dividend Paying - Person B\n\n* **1 share** of stock is worth **$120**.\n   * The price of the stock doesn't go down by 25% because there wasn't a 25% dividend paid.\n* The CEO joins the government again, and the **stock goes down by 1/3** and the person has **1 share worth $80**.\n* The **stock doubles**, and is now worth $160.  The person has **1 share worth $160**.\n   * The person never paid taxes because there was no dividend.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n* Person A ends up with **1.33 shares worth $160**\n   * Person A also has $20 of taxable gains (of some kind--unclear if short or long term).\n* Person B ends up with **1 share worth $160**.\n* Both persons would be better off if they decided exactly when and exactly how much stock to sell instead of having the company doing it for them and calling the forced sale a dividend.\n\n**Edit:**  Got rid of link to other thread and an @ at a specific user, because it was a kind of shitty thing for me to have done.",

Growth may out perform, but in times of downturns and recessions growth tends to lose while dividends still get paid out. When investing you have to decide for yourself, are you more interested in income and dividend reinvestment or are you more interested in the potential growth?",

                "body": "\"It's only when you take money out of a trad account that it's taxed.\"\n\nYes; that is why it is called a Distribution.\n\nA Traditional IRA, 401(k), SIMPLE IRA, SEP IRA, etc that is not a Roth Type, means it is comprised of pre-taxed contributions and earnings. Distributions are taxed as ordinary income, unless you also have some basis in that account (post-tax funds). Roth is the senator that provided the bill that introduced post-tax account types for retirement, and these have tax free distributions.\n\nHere is what the OP stated: \"Plus, if doing this in pre-tax accounts, investing in the former allows me to pay LT capital gain tax rather than income tax.\"\n\nAnd that is not correct.\n\nInside of a pretax account, there is no capital gain recognition. When it is distributed from a pretax retirement account (taken from the account), it is taxed as ordinary income, whether the account has loss or gain, and whether the growth is from stock prices, dividend cash or reinvestment, interest inflow, stock splits, xdividend dates, all of this doesn't matter. The earnings characteristic has no differentiated tax treatment.",

        "selftext": "I'm considering an investment in\u00a0Simply Good Foods (SMPL)\u00a0as part of a 20-year strategy in the consumer goods space. Why? Because I believe consumer goods companies that align with health trends can grow even in downturns. I\u2019m aiming for a long-term hold, looking for strong growth, stable value, and low debt.\n\n**Why Simply Good Foods?**\u00a0The company owns three key brands:\u00a0Atkins,\u00a0Quest, and\u00a0OWYN. While Atkins and OWYN have their challenges,\u00a0Quest\u00a0is a leader in the protein bar market. If a store sells protein bars, they probably stock Quest. It's a solid brand with mass distribution and great market share among fitness and health-conscious consumers.\n\n**Recent Financial Performance**: The company has been growing steadily. Fiscal 2023 saw\u00a0$955.6 million in net sales, driven mainly by Quest, with\u00a014.2% growth in sales. Plus, they operate an\u00a0asset-light model, which means they outsource manufacturing \u2013 keeping costs low and free cash flow high. Cash reserves increased to\u00a0$208.7 million, and debt was reduced to\u00a0$237.7 million\u00a0\u2013 signs of solid financial health.\n\n**Growth Catalysts**:\n\n* Acquisition of OWYN: Simply Good Foods bought OWYN, a plant-based protein brand, for\u00a0$280 million. This taps into the rising trend of plant-based diets and brings a whole new consumer base.\n* E-commerce Opportunities: They\u2019re expanding their e-commerce channels \u2013 currently,\u00a021% of Quest\u00a0and\u00a014% of Atkins\u00a0sales are online \u2013 so there's definitely room for growth here.\n\n**Competition & Risks**: Simply Good Foods does face competition in both bars and drinks. But Quest\u2019s distribution advantage gives it a strong moat, and with Atkins and OWYN being rebranded, there\u2019s potential for growth. Still, they\u2019ll need to walk a fine line to keep market share against competitors like\u00a0FitCrunch, Pure Protein,\u00a0and bigger players like\u00a0Fairlife\u00a0(Coke).\n\n**Final Thoughts**: SMPL feels like an interesting long-term play, aligning with health and nutrition trends while being reasonably valued and not over-leveraged. But it\u2019s not without challenges \u2013 especially in marketing, e-commerce, and competition in the drink and bar markets.\n\nIf you\u2019re invested or have thoughts on Simply Good Foods, I'd love to hear! And if you've tried any of their products \u2013\u00a0Atkins,\u00a0Quest, or\u00a0OWYN\u00a0\u2013 let me know what you think. Consumer feedback is key in understanding how strong a brand really is.",

We are halfway through the year so I'll have to use TTM data.\n\n**What's changed in the past year:**\n\nAs I expected, FICO's revenue growth, net income growth, and margin expansion story has been intact.\n\nTTM Revenue jumped 15% to $1.84B, TTM Net Income grew 20% to $0.57B, and EPS jumped 21.8% to $23.60.\n\nFor FY25, Management expects $1.98B Top line, GAAP Net Income to be $0.625B, with GAAP EPS to be $25.05.\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n\nLT debt has expanded from $2.2B to $2.5B. Shares outstanding have declined 1.5% to 24.9 Million. Management has also announced a $1.5B senior note offering to retire older higher rate debt. I still do not enjoy the amount of leverage on the balance sheet but I'm not in charge of it. Their cash is mostly going towards share buybacks (1.1B repurchased in TTM) which is not that accretive given the multiple.\n\n**PE:**\n\n[Imgur: The magic of the Internet](https://imgur.com/a/a7fV5Pu)\n\nIncredibly enough, FICO has expanded from a 73 PE from my previous post to a 92 PE. To say this is rich is an understatement. The market is clearly pricing in massive margin expansion as well as safety due to no tarriff risk and minimal business failure due to their monopolistic power.\n\n**Closing Remarks:**\n\nI still believe FICO is the closest thing we have to a perfect business. People may believe VantageScore to be a possible disruptor but ultimately, if everyone is using something because they trust their metrics, why risk potentially losing hundreds of thousands of dollars from poor underwriting to save a few thousand bucks? FICO is still an amazing business, but the multiple leaves little to desire. I have not sold any of my position, nor have I added more given the very rich valuation.",

You did your DD.\n\n1. **Why $ALT over $VKTX?**\n   * VKTX-2735 < PEMVI 2.4mg -- PEMVI superior quality of Weight Loss as measured by % FAT vs. % LEAN reduction (i.e. the KEY next-gen GLP1 metric)\n   * PEMVI broad CARDIOVASCULAR activity/potential\n   * PEMVI MOA includes Thermogenic/RMR component for LT use\n   * PEMVI body recomp. potential via class-leading lean muscle preservation\n   * PEMVI P3 titration/DR design to 'fix' outlier 48wk P2 (other PEMVI studies have shown tolerability on par with VK2735)\n   * VK2735 is faster WL which is better for BMI 40+ class 3 Obesity (smaller market), but not for avg. person -- VK to compete with $LLY Zep,\n   * PEMVI is SIGNIFICANTLY differentiated high quality Next-gen GLP1 WL\n   * VKTX-2809 < PEMVI 1.8mg -- PEMVI rapid liver defatting in 6-12 wks (MASLD)\n   * PEMVI better 24wk anti-fibrotic potential vs 52wk VKTX\n   * PEMVI bypasses thyroid and is leading GLP1 liver MOA\n2. **Why is Viking valued at 50$ and Altimmune at 6$?**\n   * Viking Management simply is better at managing their stock. Viking has 900 million in cash, which they simply raised in a brilliant way.\n   * Altimmune had some set-backs in the past, which may make WS suspicious.\n   * Altimmune had a short report to endure, in which Kerrisdale stupidly rehashed old data, BUT Altimmune management FAILED at protecting the stock they let Jefferies do their bidding, plus their cash runway is not convincing. Their only response was a meaningless Tweet.\n   * Altimmune cash runway 150 million (or so), they stupidly ran the ATM at the absolute wrong moment.\n   * Altimmune is stupidly promising a partner for over a year now, and have not delivered.\n3. **But why is Altimmune still the better stock?**\n   * Pemvi as explained above, is smarter. Not Obesity, but curative fatty liver - COVERED BY INSURANCE ALREADY. Which pure obesity drugs are not, like Zepbound Wegovy\n   * Altimmune has FAST TRACK status. A nugget overseen by many\n   * Altimmune has a much much larger upside, at this moment. The odds of Viking crashing, extremely high. They are a Bio, they will face a setback. I believe if Viking was to be bought now, it would be at 100$ per share\n   * If Altimmune was to be bought now, 40$-75$ per share would be fair.\n   * If Altimmune announces a partner, it will likely be a 20$ 30$ stock within days.",
