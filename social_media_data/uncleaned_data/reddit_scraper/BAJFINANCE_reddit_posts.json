The capital I usually play with is 10\u201320L. I usually sell the stocks, taking 15\u201330%, and sometimes I hold them for a long-term portfolio. I don't follow news and company results for the stocks I am holding. I also have MFs in my long-term portfolio. \n\nMy goal is to make 20% per year and eventually create a stock portfolio of 50L, making 10L a year just from the markets. \n\nHow good is this strategy? considering the market has been in a bull run for the past several years now. \n\nI'm 27 yrs old software engineer.",

That is why I have provided current value of holdings (though invested sum can be calculated pretty easily). Past gains (especially %ages) are indicative of pretty much nothing as I have been irregular in buying and accumulating over the said period.\n\nWould love everyone's views and opinions. \n\nPS - discerning folks on here will be able to see Saurabh Mukherjea's influence but even more discerning (and sympathethic) folks will be able to see I am reducing the said influence now \ud83d\ude04\n\nLATE (AND LONG) EDIT - As rightly said in some replies, MF portfolio has some unnecessary over-complication. I'm slowly moving my inv from Axis ELSS to PP ELSS (as and when 3 year limit ends), so count one less fund. The two PP funds again I count as basically one big Flexi fund, so that's again one less fund. Small caps I don't feel comfortable with just one fund, and the universe is large enough to accommodate two funds. \nSo basically-\n\u2022one Largecap (Niftybees) \n\u2022one Flexicap (2 PPs + whatever's left of Axis)\n\u2022one Large & Mid\n\u2022one Midcap\n\u2022two Smallcaps\n\u2022one USA (where in fact if someone can suggest which should I actually invest in, anyway PP Flexi can't invest more in the US stocks). \n\n",

        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

        "selftext": "Here are **five Indian stocks** that have the potential to become multibaggers, based on current trends, their market positions, and future growth potential. Keep in mind that multibagger stocks carry risks and require patience for long-term returns.\n\n### 1. **Tata Power (NSE: TATAPOWER)**\n   - **Why:** Tata Power is one of India's largest integrated power companies, with a growing focus on renewable energy, EV charging infrastructure, and solar energy solutions. As India pushes for green energy, Tata Power is well-positioned to benefit from this transition.\n\n### 2. **Persistent Systems (NSE: PERSISTENT)**\n   - **Why:** Persistent Systems is a mid-sized IT services company specializing in digital transformation, cloud services, and product engineering. With increasing digitalization globally and its focus on next-gen tech like AI, cloud computing, and IoT, it has strong growth prospects.\n\n### 3. **Bajaj Finance (NSE: BAJFINANCE)**\n   - **Why:** Bajaj Finance is a leading player in the consumer finance sector. It has a diversified product portfolio, including retail lending, SME lending, and wealth management. With India's growing demand for credit and financial services, this stock has significant long-term growth potential.\n\n### 4. **Deepak Nitrite (NSE: DEEPAKNTR)**\n   - **Why:** Deepak Nitrite is a leading chemical manufacturer with a strong market presence in performance chemicals, phenolics, and fine chemicals. The chemical industry in India is expected to grow exponentially, and Deepak Nitrite's diversification and robust operational efficiency make it a potential multibagger.\n\n### 5. **Polycab India (NSE: POLYCAB)**\n   - **Why:** Polycab is a market leader in the cables and wires industry, with a growing footprint in the consumer electricals space. With the government\u2019s focus on infrastructure development, electrification, and housing, Polycab stands to benefit from increased demand for electrical goods.\n\n### Key Points to Watch:\n- **Sectoral Trends:** These companies are in sectors that are poised for long-term growth, such as renewable energy, digital services, consumer finance, and chemicals.\n- **Economic and Policy Factors:** Favorable government policies, infrastructure spending, and renewable energy goals could provide a tailwind for these stocks.\n- **Valuation and Entry Points:** It's important to assess their valuation before investing. Some stocks might be overvalued due to market enthusiasm, so timing your entry is crucial.\n\nThese suggestions are for informational purposes, and it's always advisable to do thorough research or consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.",

The momentum indicator is bullish with positive divergence on the daily chart, and the 1-year Price/Book Value (P/BV) is below its -1 SD, indicating potential undervaluation. A similar setup in August 2024 led to a 20% rally, and there's a chance the pattern could repeat. With these factors aligning, the outlook for the stock seems promising in the near term.",

Recently, it formed an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the trendline and broke out, gaining 6.5%. The stock is trading above the 20 SMA and 40 EMA on daily and weekly timeframes, with the RMI (Rohit Momentum Indicator) signaling a buy on both. For now, the stock is looking positive.\n\nOpen Interest (OI) is near record highs, indicating significant short built-up. Despite this, the stock has consistently formed higher lows, suggesting a triangle pattern with boundaries at \u20b98000 and \u20b96,520. Historically, such setups have led to sharp rallies if the stock breaks out on the upside. Conversely, a breakdown could lead to fresh OI highs and downward pressure.",

I am 41 and doent have any liabilities, house is paid for, not interested in owning a car right now (If I will, I'll buy with cash) to add to this I have a year of expenses saved asside as emergency funds plus a PPF account which matures next year.\n\nI am also fortunate to inherit my parents folio which is currently at 1.8c with 82% of it coming from 12 stocks and it has a total of 65 stocks which were bought almost a decade back and has not been managed since. It just compounded over time. Note: Dad retired from L&T thus 33% which I need to trim. This along with my folio is for my retirement and plan to keep it long term 15+ yrs\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mg3jz8r3uidd1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=cca951302023d0a072154bc82731ce0a95ec7e05\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4gh57p4uidd1.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3a284b216e5846392ef584cb3f1c334cb441ead\n\nNow I am considering if I should go with a PMS (some options are Liquide black/Kedia securities. I am also checking for one of my aqquitances who manages PMS and is a ex Axis bank employee used to manage HNIs\n\nTalk about Liquide they charge currently have a flat structure of 30k annually and provides a 360 approach to investing including tax planning. They will have around 10 custom stocks and plan to deploy funds over 2 weeks in the market. I was a bit concerned about it but they said they are taking money from equity and reinvesting into other stocks so not really a risk persay. Also folio will be managed by me 100% they just act as advisory.\n\nOver the years I feel it is better to have specialists working (like a team of yours) that makes life easier. I'll be happy if I can get a 17%-18% CAGR and peaceful sleep\n\nYour thoughts please.. I'm sharing snapshot of my folio (from Zerodha) and parents folio (excel) so you have a fair idea on how I have performed (everyone has performed in the bull market \ud83d\ude01)\n\nYour recommendations are really appreciated, Thank You :)",

Understand the market, pick undervalued, growing, quality stocks, invest and forget. Your stock picking skills are good IMO. Just hold for long. No advisory will come in help if COVID or 2008 crash repeats, you are most likely to sell those in panic and due to lack of understanding the business. \u263a\ufe0f I'm not much qualified to advice, still I have heard these from my father. He was approached by a PMS manager, but luckily he got away from it. Now he holds many 10-20-30-40+ baggers. I'm more focused towards studying and picking growing smallcaps in value zone. Anyways PMS won't help in any market. Check historic returns of popular PMFs. Compare it with an index fund. You will yourself beat them if you have conviction on business and hold.

Instead, consider reputed firms like **360One** and **Alchemy Capital**. Both have a proven track record and are trusted by many HNIs, including several of my own clients who are extremely happy with the performance and stability of their PMS investments.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you\u2019d like more insights or need guidance regarding PMS options!",

Recently, it formed an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the trendline and broke out, gaining 6.5%. The stock is trading above the 20 SMA and 40 EMA on daily and weekly timeframes, with the RMI (Rohit Momentum Indicator) signaling a buy on both. For now, the stock is looking positive.\n\nOpen Interest (OI) is near record highs, indicating significant short built-up. Despite this, the stock has consistently formed higher lows, suggesting a triangle pattern with boundaries at \u20b98000 and \u20b96,520. Historically, such setups have led to sharp rallies if the stock breaks out on the upside. Conversely, a breakdown could lead to fresh OI highs and downward pressure.",

The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is signaling a buy, and the stock is trading above the 20 EMA and 40 EMA, reflecting bullish momentum.

The momentum indicator is bullish with positive divergence on the daily chart, and the 1-year Price/Book Value (P/BV) is below its -1 SD, indicating potential undervaluation. A similar setup in August 2024 led to a 20% rally, and there's a chance the pattern could repeat. With these factors aligning, the outlook for the stock seems promising in the near term.",

Had started with investing approx 25K in Adani enterprises as a bet for 2024 elections, but sold it in just one month with 500 rupees profit (could not handle the volatility), but by that time I had started getting interested in the basics of fundamental and technical analysis. I am not from a finance background but I am still trying my best to understand the concepts of finance (ROE, ROCE, ROA, cash flow statement, debt to equity etc.) mostly from YouTube channels (Basant Maheshwari, Invest in Bharat, etc). These are my stock picks in past 1 year. I would love to hear your views on my portfolio. The stocks did not perform well for the most of the year, and I was afraid that I won't even beat FD returns, however after election results things are changing for the better. My goal is to slowly concentrate the portfolio by reducing the companies to 9-10 in the next 3 years and keep investing for long term gains. ",

This rise occurred despite a 0.41% decline in the BSE SENSEX Index. The trading volume for Bajaj Finance was notably higher at 170,405, compared to its 50-day average of 32,623. Strong loan growth and an 18% YoY profit surge drove optimism, with analysts raising targets to a \u20b98,500 median.\n\nIt is forming an ascending triangle pattern and the price is at resistance.",

        "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/b36zrg8kgyae1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36b72c5a6b143730a73ad7efb1af9dbd1baeb2ff\n\nBajaj Finance experienced a strong bull run from June 2020 to August 2021, followed by sideways movement with consistent support along a trendline. Recently, it formed an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the trendline and broke out, gaining 6.5%. The stock is trading above the 20 SMA and 40 EMA on daily and weekly timeframes, with the RMI (Rohit Momentum Indicator) signaling a buy on both. For now, the stock is looking positive.\n\nOpen Interest (OI) is near record highs, indicating significant short built-up. Despite this, the stock has consistently formed higher lows, suggesting a triangle pattern with boundaries at \u20b98000 and \u20b96,520. Historically, such setups have led to sharp rallies if the stock breaks out on the upside. Conversely, a breakdown could lead to fresh OI highs and downward pressure.",

The momentum indicator is bullish with positive divergence on the daily chart, and the 1-year Price/Book Value (P/BV) is below its -1 SD, indicating potential undervaluation. A similar setup in August 2024 led to a 20% rally, and there's a chance the pattern could repeat. With these factors aligning, the outlook for the stock seems promising in the near term.",

The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is signaling a buy, and the stock is trading above the 20 EMA and 40 EMA, reflecting bullish momentum. Fresh OI additions at the 12,500 Call strike indicate bullish sentiment. This sets up a 500-point trading range, offering opportunities for breakout and momentum trades. Fresh OI additions at the 12500 call suggests that the call writers are shifting their position to 12500. This development potentially opens up 500 points upside based on the Open Interest data",
