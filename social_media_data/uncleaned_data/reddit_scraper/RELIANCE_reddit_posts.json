        "selftext": "Just fundamental analysis is not enough to find a blue-chip stock. A lot of investors out rightly reject technical analysis, and that\u2019s the big mistake they commit.\n\nHere\u2019s how I analyze:\n\n**Fundamental analysis:** It tells us which stock is good. By analyzing it in 4 parameters\n\n1. Financial angle  2. Business angle  3. Management angle  4. Valuation\n\n**Technical analysis:** It tells us when to enter and when to exit the stock.\n\nFor example, if you had invested in Reliance between Dec 2010 to Feb 2017, you would have made a 0% return. In fact, even a negative return was possible. This is where technical analysis comes into play.\n\nI know people will say that valuation could be a parameter to check the right price. But still, sometimes even at the right valuation, a stock doesn\u2019t move for years. By knowing technical analysis, you can save this undue waiting time.\n\nYou can mention any stock, and based on my analysis, I can help you understand this concept much better.\n\nEdit 1 :- When mentioning the name of the stock. Do put your initial views about that stock. It helps to put the right context. I may not able to reply promptly to your comments. Please have the patience. Thank you.\n\nEdit 2 :- I am overwhelmed by number of companies you all have mentioned. Slowly will revert to each of you. Do note the coming analysis wouldn't be very detail but, a small gist of it. As, it is not possible to analyse each company by the lense of fundamental and technical.\n",

Despite some volatility, the stock is still holding this key support zone. However, if this level is breached, we could see further downside as breaking a significant support often triggers selling pressure and may lead to a downward move.What are your thoughts on this? Do you see the support holding, or is a breakdown more likely?",

        "selftext": "*Original Source:* [*https://boringmoney.in/p/sbis-investment-in-jio-payments*](https://boringmoney.in/p/sbis-investment-in-jio-payments) *(my newsletter Boring Money. If you like what you read, do visit the original link to subscribe and receive future posts directly in your inbox)*\n\n\\--\n\nIn the financial world, if you\u2019re a company giving money to another company, it\u2019s likely for one of three reasons:\n\n1. You\u2019re lending it money and expect some fixed interest in return. The riskier the company you\u2019re lending to, the more interest you expect.\n2. You\u2019re investing in the company. If things work out, the value of your stake in the company goes up, and you make money. If not, you lose money, but that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s the game you\u2019re playing.\n3. You\u2019re investing, but the investment is strategic. You both bring something to the table, fill in each other\u2019s gaps. Eventually, you\u2019ll run a great business together and own a share of the profit.\n\nNice, clear differences. Right?\n\nIn 2018, the State Bank of India gave some money to Reliance Industries. The idea was that they would start a payments bank together called\u00a0[Jio Payments Bank](https://www.jiobank.in/). Reliance owned 70% of the company and SBI the remaining 30%.\n\nOn the face of it this was a strategic investment for SBI. But even at that time, this was a little unusual for a few reasons:\n\n1. Payments banks are a weird type of bank. They can take money from people as deposits, but can\u2019t lend that money out as loans. Making money is tough.\n2. SBI is a bank! It could do everything Jio Payments Bank could ever do, and much much more.\n3. Jio Payments Bank sounds like\u00a0*Reliance*, not like SBI.\n\nMaybe SBI saw great business potential in Jio Payments and was happy to be a part of it. But then\u00a0[this happened](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/jio-financial-to-acquire-sbi-stake-in-jio-payments-bank-for-rs-104-5-crore-125030400697_1.html)\u00a0last week:\n\n>The State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to divest its entire 17.8 per cent stake in Jio Payments Bank Limited, a joint venture between the state-owned bank and Jio Financial Services (JFS).\n\n>JFS will acquire the SBI\u2019s stake for \u20b9104.5 crore, after which Jio Payments Bank will become its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Reliance Group firm said on Tuesday.\n\nOkay maybe this wasn\u2019t a strategic investment after all but was financial? After eight years, SBI sold its entire stake back to Reliance itself for \u20b9104.5 crore ($12m).\n\nIntuitively we know that it wasn\u2019t the most successful investment. Jio Payments Bank is still a no-name in the payments industry. And it\u2019s been losing money like a tech startup (with a loss of \u20b950 crore last financial year) but with a revenue (\u20b930 crore last year) that doesn\u2019t show for it.\n\n# Investments in Jio Payments Bank\n\n|FY|Reliance Investment (\u20b9 Cr)|SBI Investment (\u20b9 Cr)|SBI\u2019s Share (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Total|444|79|\u2014|\n|FY 25|96\\*|0|18|\n|FY 24|4|0|23|\n|FY 23|80|0|23|\n|FY 22|22|9|30|\n|FY 21|0|0|30|\n|FY 20|0|0|30|\n|FY 19|162|70|30|\n\nBut just how bad a financial investment was this for SBI? In FY 2019, SBI invested \u20b970 crore ($8m). In FY 2022, it invested another \u20b99 crore ($1m). So that\u2019s a total of \u20b979 crore. Then in FY 2025, it\u2019s selling its stake for \u20b9104.54 crore. That\u2019s an annual return rate of 4.57%. \\[1\\]\n\nSBI would\u2019ve made more money had it invested in its own fixed deposits.\n\n# Not a lot of interest\n\nSo, SBI gave Reliance some money. Then Reliance gave it back with a 4.57% annualised return.\n\nThis sounds a bit like\u2026 a loan? Lending to start a startup is a no go, too risky for any bank\u2019s underwriting team. But an investment is fine! So maybe it made sense to just call it an investment instead?\n\nThe pieces of the puzzle fall into place if you treat SBI\u2019s investment as a low-interest loan. But hey, of course, it was just a strategic investment in a joint venture with Reliance that happened to not work out.\n\n  \n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I\u2019m referring to XIRR here. It\u2019s a simple\u00a0[calculation on Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15EicIHSg_fIauG3DN7xDtP5PhxXGBhJu7ghbV_7iI3A/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n\n\n*Original Source:* [*https://boringmoney.in/p/sbis-investment-in-jio-payments*](https://boringmoney.in/p/sbis-investment-in-jio-payments) ",

        "selftext": "# Why Reliance Is a Solid Buy Right Now\n\n1. **Narrative set ?** Reliance to build world\u2019s largest AI-powered data center in Jamnagar with $30 billion investment\n2. **Valuation Looks Attractive** Yes, the stock might look technically weak now, but in terms of valuation, it\u2019s sitting in a solid buy zone. Reliance\u2019s fundamentals remain strong, and if you're looking for a long-term play, this dip could be a great entry point.\n3. **Nifty Reversal Could Push It to \u20b91500** If NIFTY turns around, Reliance, being a heavyweight, will likely bounce back hard. Historically, it moves with the market, and if things go well, \u20b91500 isn\u2019t out of the question.\n4. **Technical Weakness = Opportunity** Sure, the charts don\u2019t look great now, but often, that's when the best opportunities arise. The risk here seems lower, with a solid upside if the market and stock turn around.\n\n**Bottom Line:** Reliance may not look perfect on the charts right now, but if you\u2019re thinking long-term, this could be the kind of strategic buy that pays off big. If the market recovers, it could hit \u20b91500\u2014and it\u2019s one of the few stocks with the fundamentals to back that up.

A huge portion of it's earnings has to be paid in the form of interest which was 23,000 crores.\n\nInstead of Reliance I'd rather buy TCS, Infosys or HCLTech instead because these companies are better at compounding its profits Y-O-Y without rights issues, very high debt and capex. \n\nThe promoters also like to dilute minority shareholders by issuing a Rights Issue every couple years, which is a low-key red flag for me. \n\nAnother issue with RIL is the fact that it is a conglomerate operating in many different sectors such as Oil-to-Chemical, Telecom, Broadband, Retail and FMCG, Fashion & Lifestyle, Payments, Wealth Management and AMC, Media. I prefer the approach of Tata Group and Bajaj, where you get to invest in separate listed entities instead of everything under one stock. \n\nFinally, RIL does not even make it to my filters for stock screening such as 5Y avg ROE of 15% or more, 5Y avg NPM of 10% or more FII+DII holding of 20% or more, 5Y Sales Growth of 10% more and 5Y Profit Growth of 10% or more, OPM of more than 15%, Market Capitalization of more than 5000 crores, Net Profit last year of at least 100 crores.",

Reliance to build world\u2019s largest AI-powered data ? center in Jamnagar with $30 billion investment\n\nMETA just announced a 65B capex, MSFT has commited 80B next year, OpenAI and Masa plan to do 100B next year. There is going to be a huge shortage of Blackwell next year, even IFF and its a big IFF reliance manages to get its hand on nvidia chips, it will hardly be world's largest. Second whatever they build will have shit Return on Capital. Tech giants are giving away free compute. Reliance wont make any substantial money on that unless they build some tech stack but Reliance doesn't have appetite to burn billions of dollars in SW R&D. \n\n> Valuation Looks Attractive \n\nDo they? \n\nDespite them selling Jio as a tech company that Jio is a mere telecom company. All those tech presentation and enterprise software claims have been nothing more than vaporware. Zoom competitor sample from 2020\nhttps://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/reliance-jio-officially-launches-zoom-rival-jio-meet/76755566\n\nThey used to hype Retail business. They made it seem like it can rival walmart in few years. While they have some enviable brands, Trent has handily outperformed them by all measure.\n\nRefinery business is in a dump globally. Dropping margins, geopolitical uncertainty and a perpetual threat of some tech disruption destroying the industry.but every once in a while they come up with some narrative about exports, technology, russian crude etc. \n\nOr their favorite claim about going debt free. \n\nBy next year : https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/ril-may-turn-debt-free-after-solar-investments/120110\n\nBy 2020: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-becomes-net-debt-free-after-raising-rs-1-68-lakh-crore-mukesh-ambani/articleshow/76456904.cms?from=mdr\n\nBy 2012: https://www.indiatvnews.com/business/india/reliance-to-be-debt-free-in-fy12-says-mukesh-ambani-1.html \n\n\nOr in 2000s they hyped up KG basin gas production. Market thought, it could even overtake mumbai high and meet half of India's needs. It turned out to be a big phuss in hindsight. I personally do not believe they werent aware. \n\nIf nothing else is working, they will do a bonus share, rights issue, a split, a merger whatever just to complicate matters \n\nMy point is they come up with new narratives to keep retail investors interested but the valuations are not cheap right now. \n\nTo be fair to Motabhai, RIL is 10x cheaper to buy than Adani total gas.  That stock got bloated on its own gas and reached space lol",

Reliance Power\u2019s higher liquidity and catalyst scores may appeal to investors seeking assets that can adapt quickly under changing market conditions. In contrast, Hindustan Petroleum\u2019s superior EMI, STOI, and LTSS suggest it may provide a more stable investment for those with a long-term, risk-averse perspective.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nReliance Power Limited stands out based on liquidity, catalyst strength, and risk-adjusted performance improvements. This data-driven recommendation is supported by a balanced integration of quantitative metrics and qualitative insights, ultimately framing Reliance Power Limited as the more strategically attractive investment under current market conditions.

Yet, the main source of income is form oil refinery. \n\n1- And when oil prices fall it should be generally benefitted from the same as it uses it as a raw material. Low cost of raw material makes for high margin and vice versa. (As per my understanding)\nI always correlated the post rally due to low oil prices, it going debt free and many mergers and deals. But low oil prices was the first primary logic for me.\n\nBut I have noticed it doesn't correlates with the same. It follows it ranges well and is negatively skewed as of now. There can be many reasons for the same. I am just concerned with the first point. \n\nThank you in advance!",

        "selftext": "*Original Source:* [*https://boringmoney.in/p/reliance-pays-a-hell-ton-of-money*](https://boringmoney.in/p/reliance-pays-a-hell-ton-of-money?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=bharat+global+reliance) *(my newsletter Boring Money, if you like what you read, please visit the original link to subscribe and receive future posts directly in your inbox)*\n\n\\--\n\nI\u2019ve always thought it funny that a company can generate infinite shares, almost like an infinite money glitch. Generate infinite shares, sell for infinite money.\n\nIf a company sells a billion shares, it\u2019s just splitting the same limited pie into a billion pieces. The total size of the pie remains the same. So of course there isn\u2019t going to be any infinite money.\n\nBut because of this infinite shares creation ability, companies can shrink the size of the piece of the pie with any particular shareholder. If I own 10 shares of a company with 100 shares, and the company magically creates another 900 shares and sells them to its favourite people, those people now have 900 while I\u2019m stuck with the same 10.\n\nThere are safeguards against this kind of stuff and it\u2019s not something that usually happens. I probably wouldn\u2019t be writing about it if it did usually happen. Late in December, SEBI\u00a0[issued an order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/dec-2024/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-bharat-global-developers-limited_90114.html)\u00a0against Bharat Global Developers, a 30-year old company whose only reason for existence was its capacity to defraud individual investors.\n\nBharat Global ran a classic pump-and-dump, and the first thing you do to run a pump-and-dump is hoard up on the shares of the company you\u2019re pumping. From SEBI\u2019s order:\n\n>\\[\u2026\\] the Company made two preferential allotment of shares \u2013 9.72 crore shares in April 2024 to 31 allottees and 35 lakh shares in August 2024 to 10 allottees. These large preferential allotments resulted in 99.5% of the shareholding being concentrated in the hands of these 41 allottees\u2026\n\nBharat Global sold more than 10 crore (100 million) shares to 41 of its favourite people. These 10 crore shares were the entire company! 99.5% of it at least. 99.5% is quite a sweet spot if you\u2019re looking to do a pump-and-dump.\n\n# The pump and the dump\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken about the general mechanics of a pump-and-dump\u00a0[before](https://boringmoney.in/p/youtube-is-great-for-pump-and-dumps#:~:text=The%20mechanics%20of%20it%20are%20known%20and%20simple%3A). It\u2019s reasonably straightforward:\n\n1. Find a relatively unknown company. Buy as many of its shares as you can.\n2. Scream your lungs out! The nicer the story about the company, the better.\n3. People thinking they\u2019re great stock pickers will buy the shares of the company. This is a dumb illiquid stock, so its price will shoot up.\n4. Sell to the suckers.\n5. ??? Profit.\n\nBharat Global sold the bulk of its shares in April 2024, first starting with 31 people. This was a \u20b997 crore sale. In August 2024, it sold another batch of shares to 10 more people for \u20b973 crore.\n\nWhen a company sells its shares in a \u201cpreferential allotment\u201d or in better words, to people that it chooses to, those people cannot sell their shares to the public right away. They\u2019re locked in for 6 months to ensure that the company isn\u2019t just distributing free money, and so that public investors have some time to evaluate and react to the company\u2019s actions.\n\nThe 31 people who bought Bharat Global\u2019s shares in April couldn\u2019t sell until at least October. As soon as October hit, the company started screaming its lungs out with announcements. Here\u2019s a slice of the kind of disclosures it made:\n\n1. \u20b9300 crore order! For potatoes! From McCain India Agro Pvt Ltd. Yeah, the frozen fries company.\n2. \u20b9650 crore order! From Tata Agro & Consumer Products. For tea leaves and dry fruits.\n3. \u20b9156 crore order! From UPL Agro\u2014groundnuts to extract oil from!\n4. A \u20b9120 crore order from Reliance Industries Ltd! For designing, engineering and constructing a refinery component.\n\nI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to say it, but all these orders were fake. SEBI went to each company and asked them about the orders. The companies from the disclosures don\u2019t even exist! Bharat Global just added a random \u201cAgro\u201d at the end of a bunch of popular companies\u2019 names to make their fake orders sound fancy.\n\nBetween 30th October and 11th December, 13 of Bharat Global\u2019s favourite 41 who were now out of the lock in, sold their shares. They made a massive \u20b9272 crore ($31 million) in profit. Here\u2019s an example of the scale of the profit:\n\n>One of the preferential allottees, namely Mahadev Manubhai Makvana who was allotted 37,82,000 shares in the first allotment, is also the Authorised Signatory in respect of two bank accounts of BGDL with Yes Bank and Axis Bank. The account opening date for Yes Bank was March 20, 2024. He offloaded 4,97,359 BGDL shares for INR 70,71,94,153 between November 01, 2024 and December 20, 2024, making a profit of approximately INR 70,22,20,563 against an investment of approximately INR 49,73,590.\n\nMahadev Manubhai Makvana (MMM?) invested \u20b949 lakh ($57k) and made \u20b970 crore ($8M). 155 times the initial investment! Uff.\n\nSEBI also discovered that MMM\u00a0*was*\u00a0Bharat Global. His name was on one of the company\u2019s bank accounts! If you\u2019re running a pump-and-dump, maybe don\u2019t put your name on the bank account of the company you\u2019re pumping.\n\nBoring Money is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\n# And then there was Reliance\n\nOf the four fake disclosures I highlighted, one is not the same as the others. When SEBI wrote to Reliance to figure out if they had indeed placed a \u20b9120 crore order with Bharat Global, here\u2019s what it got:\n\n>RIL submitted vide e-mail dated December 19, 2024 that BGDL had not supplied any material for the FCC project of RIL\u2019s refinery. RIL further submitted that BGDL (formerly known as Kkrrafton Developers Limited) had supplied only general construction materials to RIL for about INR 155 crore (including taxes) during the period from April 01, 2024 to September 30, 2024 which was not related to the FCC project.\n\nBharat Global\u2019s announcement about a \u20b9120 crore order was false, no surprises there, but Reliance told SEBI that there was\u00a0*another*\u00a0\u20b9155 crore order which was apparently legitimate and fulfilled?!\n\nBizarre. Very bizarre. Bharat Global was a company whose revenue was literally 0 for many years before it turned into a money grabbing vehicle. It lied about having subsidiaries which did not exist. The company changed its name 4 times in its lifetime. (Probably picked the name \u201cBharat Global\u201d because of how patriotic the pumpers-and-dumpers were.)\n\nThere was no business! There was never a business! All its disclosures were fake. And yet, somehow, out of nowhere, not only did it have a real \u20b9155 crore order from Reliance, but it also\u00a0*chose to*\u00a0make up a fake order when it could very well have just disclosed the real one instead?\n\nI think this takes the cake for anything I\u2019ve written until now. And I\u2019ve written about some\u00a0[weird stuff](https://boringmoney.in/p/embassy-reit-looks-at-a-fraud#:~:text=suspicious%20was%20suspicious.-,FIT%20AND%20PROPER,-If%20you%20were). I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. SEBI needs to jump on this thread and find some answers. But hey, until then, maybe I can guess?\n\nHere\u2019s some stuff about Reliance\u2019s payments from SEBI\u2019s order:\n\n>\u2026 data submitted by RIL shows that a payment of INR 57.22 crore was made to Kkrrafton Developers Limited on March 16, 2024, another 8.07 crore on March 19, 2024 and a last payment of INR 28.04 crore on August 12, 2024.\n\nand,\n\n>\\[\u2026\\] In this regard, from the bank statements of BGDL obtained from Indian Bank, it was observed that RIL made advance payments of Rs. 65.29 crore to BGDL in March 2024.\n\nReliance paid Bharat Global \u20b965 crore in advance and before it even raised an invoice for that money! In all, Reliance paid the company at \u20b993 crore, with the last payment in August. Now come on, Reliance is known to be pretty cut-throat, always getting the better half of a deal. Paying a zero-revenue company \u20b965 crore before it\u2019s even asked to doesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\nLet\u2019s put these events down in chronological order:\n\n1. In March 2024, Reliance paid Bharat Global \u20b965 crore out of the goodness of its heart.\n2. The next month in April, Bharat Global allotted shares worth \u20b997 crore to its favourite people.\n3. In August, Reliance paid another \u20b928 crore.\n4. Later in the same month, Bharat Global allotted another \u20b973 crore worth of shares to its favourite people.\n5. The money that Reliance paid Bharat Global did not show up in Bharat Global\u2019s financial statements.\n\nIs there a connection between the money Reliance paid Bharat Global and the money that Bharat Global\u2019s favourite people paid it? I don\u2019t know. Were those people really using Reliance\u2019s money to run a pump-and-dump? I have absolutely no idea. \\[1\\]\n\n# Playing saviour\n\nThe people that bought Bharat Global\u2019s shares in its second sale in August were to be locked in until February 2025. By late December, just before SEBI stepped in, Bharat Global\u2019s pumped-up price was at \u20b91300\u20146X the price that the August buyers got the shares at.\n\nThis post would\u2019ve probably been a two-part pump-and-dump series, had SEBI not identified the first pump-and-dump in time. For now, the 13 folks that made the \u20b9272 crore profit will have to give the money back. And the others that couldn\u2019t sell Bharat Global\u2019s shares in time will be stuck holding the bag.\u00a0\\[2\\]\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I really mean this! There are a lot of unknowns.\n\n\\[2\\] In the process of writing this I discovered that some of the 41 people are very obviously involved in other pump-and-dumps as well. Attempts at them, at least, if not successful ones. I\u2019ll probably write about it in a future MYSTERY POST.",

Which is what happen in 2024 too. So hoping that this trend would repeat\n\nReason for the downfall - on searching online, I found that the main reason for the stock price to plunge is the retail inflation and the price rise. This erodes the profit margins of the company even though the company is generating good revenue. \n\nValue unlocking - looking at some of the development, I feel reliance is one company that is planning massive to enter into almost all verticals - entertainment, mobile service, fashion, oil, chemicals, power and almost everything else (except perhaps for pharmaceuticals). The initiatives they have taken makes me feel, it\u2019s just a matter of time for such actions to bear fruit. Besides, reliance retain and Jio listing would serve as value unlocking.\n\nWith these points, I have taken entry into the stock and want your opinion and thoughts on reliance, how high are you expecting it to soar and if you will take entry ",

        "selftext": "Investing in large-cap companies like Reliance, Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and ITC may not yield multibagger returns. For significant gains, consider small-cap, micro-cap, and select mid-cap stocks. Let\u2019s explore why and how these investments can be more rewarding.\n\nHow Does a Stock Become a Multibagger?\nLow Price and Low Market Capitalization (Mcap):\nA stock is low-priced when it has a low Mcap, often due to existing negatives or concerns in the market.\nMarket participants tend to overlook these stocks because of these perceived negatives, keeping their prices low.\nThe Investment Strategy\nIdentifying Potential Multibaggers:\n\nAs investors seeking multibagger returns, our goal is to identify and invest in stocks that the market is not currently favoring.\nOnce the negative aspects are resolved, the stock\u2019s value can significantly increase.\nExample:\n\nConsider a small-cap stock in the pharmaceutical sector, such as Laurus Labs. Initially, it may have faced issues with regulatory approvals, keeping its price low. Once these hurdles were overcome, the stock saw substantial growth, becoming a multibagger.\nThe Common Misconception\nExpecting Perfect Fundamentals at Low Prices:\n\nIt is unrealistic to find a stock priced at 20 with perfect fundamentals. Such stocks will naturally have some negatives.\nLarge-cap stocks with a Mcap of 10,000 crores or more have often already delivered significant returns. Expecting them to become multibaggers from this point is impractical.\nExample:\n\nInfosys, a leading IT company, has a high Mcap and has already provided substantial returns over the years. Expecting it to continue delivering multibagger returns is unrealistic.\nThe Potential of Smaller Mcap Stocks\nSmaller Mcap Stocks Have Higher Growth Potential:\n\nStocks with a Mcap of 200 crores can grow to 2,000 crores, providing a tenfold return.\nSimilarly, a stock with a Mcap of 500 crores can grow to 5,000 crores, offering significant returns.\nExample:\n\nConsider a company like Avanti Feeds, which had a lower Mcap but expanded its business significantly, leading to multibagger returns.\nUnderstanding Market Saturation\nSaturation Point and Valuation:\n\nAfter a certain Mcap, a stock\u2019s growth potential diminishes, making it harder to achieve multibagger status.\nStocks with Mcaps above 10,000 crores require extraordinary growth to become multibaggers, which is challenging.\nExample:\n\nTata Motors, with a high Mcap, would need exceptional growth in sales and profitability to double or triple its value, which is less likely compared to smaller companies.\nSimple Rules for Stock Market Success\nBuy Less Discussed Stocks:\n\nInvesting in under-the-radar stocks can yield high returns as they are often undervalued.\nBuy Underowned Stocks:\n\nStocks with low institutional ownership may have greater growth potential once discovered.\nLook for Multibagger Prospects:\n\nFocus on companies with the potential for significant growth rather than those that have already delivered high returns.\nAvoid Stocks That Are Already Multibaggers:\n\nStocks that have already provided substantial returns may have limited future growth.\nConsider Mcap:\n\nAlways evaluate the Mcap to understand the potential for future growth. Stocks with lower Mcaps generally have higher growth potential.\nBy following these guidelines and focusing on small-cap, micro-cap, and promising mid-cap stocks, investors can build a portfolio with the potential for multibagger returns. Remember, the key lies in identifying undervalued opportunities and being patient as these stocks realize their growth potential.",

This long-standing support level has proven reliable over the years, adding weight to its significance.\n\nOn the technical front, the weekly Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is still bearish mode but it is starting to turn upward below the zero line. On the valuation front, the stock is trading below -1 Standard Deviation (SD) of its 5 Year EV/EBITDA suggesting it may be undervalued at current levels\n\nThe key question now is whether Reliance will rebound from this pivotal zone or break the four-year-old trendline, signaling further downside.  \nThis is my personal Opinion",

You\u2019re lending it money and expect some fixed interest in return. The riskier the company you\u2019re lending to, the more interest you expect.\n2. You\u2019re investing in the company. If things work out, the value of your stake in the company goes up, and you make money. If not, you lose money, but that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s the game you\u2019re playing.\n3. You\u2019re investing, but the investment is strategic. You both bring something to the table, fill in each other\u2019s gaps. Eventually, you\u2019ll run a great business together and own a share of the profit.\n\nNice, clear differences. Right?\n\nIn 2018, the State Bank of India gave some money to Reliance Industries. The idea was that they would start a payments bank together called\u00a0[Jio Payments Bank](https://www.jiobank.in/). Reliance owned 70% of the company and SBI the remaining 30%.\n\nOn the face of it this was a strategic investment for SBI. But even at that time, this was a little unusual for a few reasons:\n\n1. Payments banks are a weird type of bank. They can take money from people as deposits, but can\u2019t lend that money out as loans. Making money is tough.\n2. SBI is a bank! It could do everything Jio Payments Bank could ever do, and much much more.\n3. Jio Payments Bank sounds like\u00a0*Reliance*, not like SBI.\n\nMaybe SBI saw great business potential in Jio Payments and was happy to be a part of it. But then\u00a0[this happened](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/jio-financial-to-acquire-sbi-stake-in-jio-payments-bank-for-rs-104-5-crore-125030400697_1.html)\u00a0last week:\n\n>The State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to divest its entire 17.8 per cent stake in Jio Payments Bank Limited, a joint venture between the state-owned bank and Jio Financial Services (JFS).\n\n>JFS will acquire the SBI\u2019s stake for \u20b9104.5 crore, after which Jio Payments Bank will become its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Reliance Group firm said on Tuesday.\n\nOkay maybe this wasn\u2019t a strategic investment after all but was financial? After eight years, SBI sold its entire stake back to Reliance itself for \u20b9104.5 crore ($12m).\n\nIntuitively we know that it wasn\u2019t the most successful investment. Jio Payments Bank is still a no-name in the payments industry. And it\u2019s been losing money like a tech startup (with a loss of \u20b950 crore last financial year) but with a revenue (\u20b930 crore last year) that doesn\u2019t show for it.\n\n# Investments in Jio Payments Bank\n\n|FY|Reliance Investment (\u20b9 Cr)|SBI Investment (\u20b9 Cr)|SBI\u2019s Share (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Total|444|79|\u2014|\n|FY 25|96\\*|0|18|\n|FY 24|4|0|23|\n|FY 23|80|0|23|\n|FY 22|22|9|30|\n|FY 21|0|0|30|\n|FY 20|0|0|30|\n|FY 19|162|70|30|\n\nBut just how bad a financial investment was this for SBI? In FY 2019, SBI invested \u20b970 crore ($8m). In FY 2022, it invested another \u20b99 crore ($1m). So that\u2019s a total of \u20b979 crore. Then in FY 2025, it\u2019s selling its stake for \u20b9104.54 crore. That\u2019s an annual return rate of 4.57%. \\[1\\]\n\nSBI would\u2019ve made more money had it invested in its own fixed deposits.\n\n# Not a lot of interest\n\nSo, SBI gave Reliance some money. Then Reliance gave it back with a 4.57% annualised return.\n\nThis sounds a bit like\u2026 a loan? Lending to start a startup is a no go, too risky for any bank\u2019s underwriting team. But an investment is fine! So maybe it made sense to just call it an investment instead?\n\nThe pieces of the puzzle fall into place if you treat SBI\u2019s investment as a low-interest loan. But hey, of course, it was just a strategic investment in a joint venture with Reliance that happened to not work out.\n\n  \n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I\u2019m referring to XIRR here. It\u2019s a simple\u00a0[calculation on Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15EicIHSg_fIauG3DN7xDtP5PhxXGBhJu7ghbV_7iI3A/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n\n\n*Original Source:* [*https://boringmoney.in/p/sbis-investment-in-jio-payments*](https://boringmoney.in/p/sbis-investment-in-jio-payments) ",

Generate infinite shares, sell for infinite money.\n\nIf a company sells a billion shares, it\u2019s just splitting the same limited pie into a billion pieces. The total size of the pie remains the same. So of course there isn\u2019t going to be any infinite money.\n\nBut because of this infinite shares creation ability, companies can shrink the size of the piece of the pie with any particular shareholder. If I own 10 shares of a company with 100 shares, and the company magically creates another 900 shares and sells them to its favourite people, those people now have 900 while I\u2019m stuck with the same 10.\n\nThere are safeguards against this kind of stuff and it\u2019s not something that usually happens. I probably wouldn\u2019t be writing about it if it did usually happen. Late in December, SEBI\u00a0[issued an order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/dec-2024/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-bharat-global-developers-limited_90114.html)\u00a0against Bharat Global Developers, a 30-year old company whose only reason for existence was its capacity to defraud individual investors.\n\nBharat Global ran a classic pump-and-dump, and the first thing you do to run a pump-and-dump is hoard up on the shares of the company you\u2019re pumping. From SEBI\u2019s order:\n\n>\\[\u2026\\] the Company made two preferential allotment of shares \u2013 9.72 crore shares in April 2024 to 31 allottees and 35 lakh shares in August 2024 to 10 allottees. These large preferential allotments resulted in 99.5% of the shareholding being concentrated in the hands of these 41 allottees\u2026\n\nBharat Global sold more than 10 crore (100 million) shares to 41 of its favourite people. These 10 crore shares were the entire company! 99.5% of it at least. 99.5% is quite a sweet spot if you\u2019re looking to do a pump-and-dump.\n\n# The pump and the dump\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken about the general mechanics of a pump-and-dump\u00a0[before](https://boringmoney.in/p/youtube-is-great-for-pump-and-dumps#:~:text=The%20mechanics%20of%20it%20are%20known%20and%20simple%3A). It\u2019s reasonably straightforward:\n\n1. Find a relatively unknown company. Buy as many of its shares as you can.\n2. Scream your lungs out! The nicer the story about the company, the better.\n3. People thinking they\u2019re great stock pickers will buy the shares of the company. This is a dumb illiquid stock, so its price will shoot up.\n4. Sell to the suckers.\n5. ??? Profit.\n\nBharat Global sold the bulk of its shares in April 2024, first starting with 31 people. This was a \u20b997 crore sale. In August 2024, it sold another batch of shares to 10 more people for \u20b973 crore.\n\nWhen a company sells its shares in a \u201cpreferential allotment\u201d or in better words, to people that it chooses to, those people cannot sell their shares to the public right away. They\u2019re locked in for 6 months to ensure that the company isn\u2019t just distributing free money, and so that public investors have some time to evaluate and react to the company\u2019s actions.\n\nThe 31 people who bought Bharat Global\u2019s shares in April couldn\u2019t sell until at least October. As soon as October hit, the company started screaming its lungs out with announcements. Here\u2019s a slice of the kind of disclosures it made:\n\n1. \u20b9300 crore order! For potatoes! From McCain India Agro Pvt Ltd. Yeah, the frozen fries company.\n2. \u20b9650 crore order! From Tata Agro & Consumer Products. For tea leaves and dry fruits.\n3. \u20b9156 crore order! From UPL Agro\u2014groundnuts to extract oil from!\n4. A \u20b9120 crore order from Reliance Industries Ltd! For designing, engineering and constructing a refinery component.\n\nI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to say it, but all these orders were fake. SEBI went to each company and asked them about the orders. The companies from the disclosures don\u2019t even exist! Bharat Global just added a random \u201cAgro\u201d at the end of a bunch of popular companies\u2019 names to make their fake orders sound fancy.\n\nBetween 30th October and 11th December, 13 of Bharat Global\u2019s favourite 41 who were now out of the lock in, sold their shares. They made a massive \u20b9272 crore ($31 million) in profit. Here\u2019s an example of the scale of the profit:\n\n>One of the preferential allottees, namely Mahadev Manubhai Makvana who was allotted 37,82,000 shares in the first allotment, is also the Authorised Signatory in respect of two bank accounts of BGDL with Yes Bank and Axis Bank. The account opening date for Yes Bank was March 20, 2024. He offloaded 4,97,359 BGDL shares for INR 70,71,94,153 between November 01, 2024 and December 20, 2024, making a profit of approximately INR 70,22,20,563 against an investment of approximately INR 49,73,590.\n\nMahadev Manubhai Makvana (MMM?) invested \u20b949 lakh ($57k) and made \u20b970 crore ($8M). 155 times the initial investment! Uff.\n\nSEBI also discovered that MMM\u00a0*was*\u00a0Bharat Global. His name was on one of the company\u2019s bank accounts! If you\u2019re running a pump-and-dump, maybe don\u2019t put your name on the bank account of the company you\u2019re pumping.\n\nBoring Money is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\n# And then there was Reliance\n\nOf the four fake disclosures I highlighted, one is not the same as the others. When SEBI wrote to Reliance to figure out if they had indeed placed a \u20b9120 crore order with Bharat Global, here\u2019s what it got:\n\n>RIL submitted vide e-mail dated December 19, 2024 that BGDL had not supplied any material for the FCC project of RIL\u2019s refinery. RIL further submitted that BGDL (formerly known as Kkrrafton Developers Limited) had supplied only general construction materials to RIL for about INR 155 crore (including taxes) during the period from April 01, 2024 to September 30, 2024 which was not related to the FCC project.\n\nBharat Global\u2019s announcement about a \u20b9120 crore order was false, no surprises there, but Reliance told SEBI that there was\u00a0*another*\u00a0\u20b9155 crore order which was apparently legitimate and fulfilled?!\n\nBizarre. Very bizarre. Bharat Global was a company whose revenue was literally 0 for many years before it turned into a money grabbing vehicle. It lied about having subsidiaries which did not exist. The company changed its name 4 times in its lifetime. (Probably picked the name \u201cBharat Global\u201d because of how patriotic the pumpers-and-dumpers were.)\n\nThere was no business! There was never a business! All its disclosures were fake. And yet, somehow, out of nowhere, not only did it have a real \u20b9155 crore order from Reliance, but it also\u00a0*chose to*\u00a0make up a fake order when it could very well have just disclosed the real one instead?\n\nI think this takes the cake for anything I\u2019ve written until now. And I\u2019ve written about some\u00a0[weird stuff](https://boringmoney.in/p/embassy-reit-looks-at-a-fraud#:~:text=suspicious%20was%20suspicious.-,FIT%20AND%20PROPER,-If%20you%20were). I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. SEBI needs to jump on this thread and find some answers. But hey, until then, maybe I can guess?\n\nHere\u2019s some stuff about Reliance\u2019s payments from SEBI\u2019s order:\n\n>\u2026 data submitted by RIL shows that a payment of INR 57.22 crore was made to Kkrrafton Developers Limited on March 16, 2024, another 8.07 crore on March 19, 2024 and a last payment of INR 28.04 crore on August 12, 2024.\n\nand,\n\n>\\[\u2026\\] In this regard, from the bank statements of BGDL obtained from Indian Bank, it was observed that RIL made advance payments of Rs. 65.29 crore to BGDL in March 2024.\n\nReliance paid Bharat Global \u20b965 crore in advance and before it even raised an invoice for that money! In all, Reliance paid the company at \u20b993 crore, with the last payment in August. Now come on, Reliance is known to be pretty cut-throat, always getting the better half of a deal. Paying a zero-revenue company \u20b965 crore before it\u2019s even asked to doesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\nLet\u2019s put these events down in chronological order:\n\n1. In March 2024, Reliance paid Bharat Global \u20b965 crore out of the goodness of its heart.\n2. The next month in April, Bharat Global allotted shares worth \u20b997 crore to its favourite people.\n3. In August, Reliance paid another \u20b928 crore.\n4. Later in the same month, Bharat Global allotted another \u20b973 crore worth of shares to its favourite people.\n5. The money that Reliance paid Bharat Global did not show up in Bharat Global\u2019s financial statements.\n\nIs there a connection between the money Reliance paid Bharat Global and the money that Bharat Global\u2019s favourite people paid it? I don\u2019t know. Were those people really using Reliance\u2019s money to run a pump-and-dump? I have absolutely no idea. \\[1\\]\n\n# Playing saviour\n\nThe people that bought Bharat Global\u2019s shares in its second sale in August were to be locked in until February 2025. By late December, just before SEBI stepped in, Bharat Global\u2019s pumped-up price was at \u20b91300\u20146X the price that the August buyers got the shares at.\n\nThis post would\u2019ve probably been a two-part pump-and-dump series, had SEBI not identified the first pump-and-dump in time. For now, the 13 folks that made the \u20b9272 crore profit will have to give the money back. And the others that couldn\u2019t sell Bharat Global\u2019s shares in time will be stuck holding the bag.\u00a0\\[2\\]\n\n\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I really mean this! There are a lot of unknowns.\n\n\\[2\\] In the process of writing this I discovered that some of the 41 people are very obviously involved in other pump-and-dumps as well. Attempts at them, at least, if not successful ones. I\u2019ll probably write about it in a future MYSTERY POST.\n\n  \nOriginal Source: [https://boringmoney.in/p/reliance-pays-a-hell-ton-of-money](https://boringmoney.in/p/reliance-pays-a-hell-ton-of-money?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=bharat+global+reliance)",

        "selftext": "*Original Source:* [*https://boringmoney.in/p/jio-financial-wants-to-lend-routers*](https://boringmoney.in/p/jio-financial-wants-to-lend-routers?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=jio+financial+routers) *(my newsletter Boring Money. If you like what you read, do visit the original link to subscribe and receive future posts directly in your inbox)*\n\n--\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken about this a\u00a0[couple](https://boringmoney.in/p/vedanta-wants-to-split-into-six)\u00a0of\u00a0[times](https://boringmoney.in/p/zee-merge-with-sony-shirpur). If you\u2019re a billionaire, you probably like having separate companies for separate businesses. One of your businesses might be old, boring and predictable. It\u2019s probably what brings in a stable income every month. Another of your businesses might be batshit crazy with years to go before it sees a profit. If the wacko blows up, you don\u2019t want the reliable uncle to go down with it.\n\nThis insulation is nice for you, and it\u2019s nice for your investors who can pick and choose the companies they like and ditch the ones they don\u2019t. In general, having multiple companies doing different stuff is a good thing.\n\nSometimes, though, these companies might intersect. If one of your companies is, say, a large retail company, and the other is a payments company, it might make sense to plug your payments company into your retail company wherever you can. That way, your payments company can get some business, and your retail company can hopefully get a discounted price. \\[1\\]\n\nLet\u2019s change the example. Let\u2019s say business hasn\u2019t been great for your retail company. Now, what if you created\u00a0a\u00a0*new*\u00a0company just so that it could go and buy stuff from your retail company? That\u2019s probably not too nice. From the Ken\u00a0[last week](https://the-ken.com/story/who-stands-to-gain-the-most-from-jio-financials-us4-3b-lease-deal-hint-not-jio-financial/?searchTerm=jio):\n\n>Reliance Industries (RIL) is back with yet another one-of-its-kind deal structuring\u2014this time, targeting three birds with one stone.\n\n>The latest instance of the deal-structuring chops of the Mukesh Ambani-controlled oil-to-retail behemoth lies in a proposal from its youngest child, Jio Financial Services. The financial services entity wants to buy and lease customer premises equipment/devices and telecom gears, such as airfibre, phones, and laptops, worth Rs 36,000 crore (US$4.3 billion) over the two years ending March 2026.\n\n>There seems nothing exceptional about it, except that Jio Financial wants to do this big deal in-house. Its subsidiary, Jio Leasing Services, plans to buy the equipment from group company Reliance Retail and lease it to customers of Reliance Jio Infocomm, RIL\u2019s telecommunications arm.\n\nMukesh Ambani owns both Reliance Industries and Jio Financial Services. \\[2\\]\u00a0Jio Financial Services\u2014which doesn\u2019t even have a financial services business yet\u2014has a subsidiary called Jio Leasing Services. This subsidiary, Jio Leasing, is going to buy some electronics from Reliance Retail, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries. Jio Leasing will then lease these electronics, which I guess would be stuff like routers, modems, antennas, to customers of Reliance Jio, the telecom company which like Reliance Retail is a subsidiary of Reliance Industries.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/40y1zxckoo7d1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=d61c3916d8bf14d1b31c1446e1a8f794fde86d08\n\nAlso\u2014Jio Leasing is going to buy \u20b936,000 crore ($4.4 billion) worth of stuff?! Jio Financial, which owns Jio Leasing, is an NBFC whose primary business is supposedly to lend out money, charge an interest, get repaid. It\u2019s not begun doing that yet, but it is spending $4.4 billion over two years to lend out some routers and modems instead? \\[3\\]\n\nYou know what? Fine. Maybe routers are going to replace fiat money very soon. And all lending and borrowing is going to be denominated in TP-Link routers. Maybe the RBI is going to ask banks to ditch their Rupee reserves and switch to routers instead.\n\nEven so, why does Jio Financial buy those routers from Reliance Retail? Here\u2019s the company\u2019s rationale\u00a0[from its postal ballot notice](https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/corporate/JIOFIN_23052024125038_PostalBallotNotice.pdf)\u00a0asking shareholders to approve this transaction (among others): \\[4\\]\n\n>RRL \\[Reliance Retail\\] is in the business of dealing in customer premises equipment, enterprise devices and other telecom devices. RRL is able to procure these goods at competitive prices due to large volumes and RRL will be providing these devices to JLSL \\[Jio Leasing\\] at cost plus agreed margin.\n\nUmm.. Jio Financial is buying $4.4 billion worth of stuff. Sure, Reliance Retail might be able to procure these goods at competitive prices. But couldn\u2019t Jio Financial? If I was spending $4.4 billion, I wouldn\u2019t go to a retailer. I\u2019d go to the manufacturers and pick the one that danced the best.\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] This is happening! In addition to Jio Leasing Services buying from Reliance Retail, another subsidiary of Jio Financial\u2014Jio Payment Solutions\u2014is going to manage payments for Reliance Retail\u2019s stores as well as website. In addition to, of course, buying equipment from Reliance Retail itself. It seems to me like buying from Reliance Retail is every Jio Financial subsidiary\u2019s rite of passage.\n\n\\[2\\] I mean, they\u2019re both listed companies so Ambani doesn\u2019t technically \u201cown\u201d them. He just owns huge chunks of both.\n\n\\[3\\] At the end of March 2024, Jio Financial had \u20b924,000 crore in total assets. How is it going to pay \u20b936,000 crore to Reliance Retail? Unfortunately, they don\u2019t tell us that. Hopefully it\u2019s something funny so that I can write about it.\n\n\\[4\\] Since the possible conflict of interest in transactions like this is obvious, Jio Financial has to take shareholder approval for them to go through. Considering Ambani owns nearly 50% of Jio Financial, it probably will go through.\n\n*Original Source:* [*https://boringmoney.in/p/jio-financial-wants-to-lend-routers*](https://boringmoney.in/p/jio-financial-wants-to-lend-routers)",

        "selftext": "India posted a trade deficit of $99.2 billion with China in the 2024-25 fiscal year, according to trade data, primarily due to a sharp rise in imports of electronic goods and consumer durables.This is a few billion short of the psychologically significant $100-billion mark.\n\nThis report comes amidst high drama surrounding US president Donald Trump\u2019s announcement last week of a 90-day suspension on most tariff increases for key trade partners, including India, while significantly raising tariffs on Chinese products. The latter has raised concerns that Chinese companies might redirect their exports to alternative markets.\n\nData released by the Union commerce ministry on April 16 showed that exports to China fell by nearly 3% in March and declined by more than 14% over the full financial year. Imports from China, however, saw a sharp rise \u2013 surging 25% in March to $9.6 billion and increasing over 11% year-on-year to $113.4 billion.\n\nThese figures display India\u2019s disproportionate reliance on Chinese imports, especially in sectors such as electronics, machinery, and chemicals. China is also India\u2019s leading supplier across all eight major industrial product categories.",

From [their own blog](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/general/introducing-zerodha-fund-house), their aim is to offer simple and easy-to-understand mutual funds that could bring in the next ten million investors. Their philosophy is simple - to offer only low-cost index funds and solutions that investors can use for all their goals.\n\n**Vishal Jain**:\n\nVishal has over 25 years of experience in financial services including 20 plus years building ETFs and passive products.  \n  \nHe started his career in the AMC industry as part of the founding team of Benchmark AMC which launched India\u2019s first ETF in 2001 - Nifty BeES, as a Fund Manager. Post the acquisition of Benchmark AMC by Goldman Sachs AMC India in 2011, he was Chief Investment Officer of the Passive business.  \n  \nAfter a short entrepreneurial stint in the food business, he joined Nippon Life India Asset Management Ltd (earlier Reliance Mutual Fund) in 2016 as Head of the ETF business where he oversaw scaling of the Passive business from Rs.7,500 crore to Rs.55,000 crore.  \n  \nHe has been part of various committees and groups relating to development of passive products in India. Recently, he was part of the \u201cWorking Group on Passive Funds\u201d constituted by SEBI to recommend changes in Regulations and Market Infrastructure to foster the growth of ETFs and Index Funds.\n\n\n\nThe AMA will focus primarily on **\"Index Funds and ETFs\"** and is scheduled for\u00a0**31st July, 2024 from 10am to 6pm.** Given the sub tends to gravitate towards encouraging index funds for new investors, I'm pretty sure you would questions around this topic.\n\nIf you are unavailable on these days and would like to have your questions answered, leave them here or PM the mods, and we'll try and have them answered by the Zerodha AMC team. You can also post your questions now, to give them time to prepare their responses (answers would be in the AMA thread on 31st).",

        "selftext": "This Dhanteras, the sub will host an AMA on gold as an asset class, by Vishal Jain from Zerodha Fund House.\n\nWe've seen a lot of debate this year around gold, especially around the taxation and valuation changes around SGBs, and a lot of people have asked what is a better instrument for taking exposure to gold, whether to take treat it as an asset class, and its role in someone's portfolio.\n\nWe've had an AMA by Vishal a few months back, and he might not need introductions to a few of you, but for those who are new to the sub -\n\n**About Zerodha Fund House**:\n\nZerodha Fund House was launched last year.

        "selftext": "EID Parry is like that grand old tree in your backyard\u2014rooted deep in history, yet constantly sprouting new branches. It was founded 182 years ago, and if we calculate its lifespan using the\u00a0[Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect), it will still be around in 2206.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just any sugar business; it\u2019s an agricultural titan in disguise, churning out everything from your morning sugar to spirulina, fertilizers and biofuels. So, grab your favourite\u00a0[Mithai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweets_from_the_Indian_subcontinent), and let\u2019s dive in!\n\nContents:\n\n1. Company overview & business model\n2. Balance sheet & capital allocation\n3. Valuation\n4. Risks\n5. Future growth potential\n6. Conclusion & sources\n\n# Company overview & business model\n\nEID Parry is part of the\u00a0[Murugappa group](https://mysuccessproject.in/murugappa-group-explore-the-120-years-legacy/), one of the oldest business groups in India with 28+ businesses and a long history of fiduciary responsibility.\n\n* Parry is the largest sugar manufacturer in South India. It started in 1842, when it opened the country\u2019s first ever sugar plant at Nellikuppam, Tamil Nadu\n* 30% of the sugar output is sold under the Parry brand, while 70% is sold in bulk.\n   * The management team have indicated that they are planning to \u201cmove up the value chain\u201d, with more focus on their branded line of sugar and nutraceuticals (spirulina , palmetto etc.).\n   * The Indian government curbed\u00a0[sugar exports in 2023](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/india-extends-curbs-sugar-exports-calm-domestic-prices-2023-10-18/), in order to control domestic sugar prices\n   * To combat the sugar business's cyclicality, Parry has also significantly invested in distillery capacity, aligning with the Indian government's plan for increased domestic energy supply.\n* Their branded sugar and FMCG business (27% of their revenue) is scaling rapidly, with the number of distribution outlets increasing from 20k in 2021 to 110k currently\n* Apart from this, they also have a power generation and sugar refinery businesses, both of which have struggled to maintain profitability. These two business have depressed the margins over the last five years, which were around 1% on average.\n* Even if loss-making units break even, margins would only increase to a razor-thin 2-3%, reflecting the commoditized nature of the sugar industry.\n\n# Holding company structure\n\nThe Murugappa group took over EID Parry in 1981 and now own 38.3% of business. EID Parry, in turn, owns 56% of Coromandel International, which it had co-founded in the 1960s.\n\n* Coromandel is the largest private phosphatic fertiliser manufacturer, and 2nd largest overall. The company enjoys 60% market share in the \u2018Rice Bowl\u2019 regions of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana\n* Around half of Coromandel\u2019s sales come from exports, where they see significant headroom for growth\n* [IFFCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Farmers_Fertiliser_Cooperative), which is a Fertiliser Cooperative, is the largest fertilizer producer in India, with roughly twice the revenues of Coromandel. Coromandel has been gaining market share, with revenues growing \\~11% CAGR since 2019, while IFFCOs sales have remained flat\n\n# Balance sheet and capital allocation\n\n* EID Parry had significant debt before 2020 but has since paid down a majority, leading to a fortress-like balance sheet and net cash of \u20b923 billion (\u20b92300 crore) as of March 2024\n* This gives them flexibility to invest in sugar-adjacent businesses (like distillery & nutraceuticals) and buy depressed assets during market downturns.\n* Capital allocation has been hit-and-miss, with some of their ventures like Coromandel and the sugar distillery investments generating high ROCE , while other ones like the refinery have had very poor returns.\n   * Overall , ROCE has been exceptional, averaging 26% since 2017\n   * The management has expressed interest in further inorganic expansion in the FMCG space, but they have been pretty prudent so fair in sizing their capital investments, while maintaining a pristine balance sheet\n   * Parry have also reduced their Coromandel stake from 60%+ to 56% currently. But don\u2019t seem to have any plans to further trim their position.\n* They haven\u2019t fully reinvested their earnings. So, they do pay out dividends and have built up a cash position. An approximate capital deployment break-down over the last few years:\n   * 50% re-invested into CAPEX\n   * 30% paid out in dividend\n   * 20% going to debt repayment or cash reserves\n\n# Valuation\n\nMany of the previous valuations I\u2019ve read online seem to take a comparative valuation approach with a \u201cHold-Co discount\u201d added on top. However, I chose to employ a discounted cash flow analysis, assuming the earnings of Coromandel will flow through to EID Parry shareholders eventually, either via dividends or incremental equity ownership.\n\nWarren Buffett follows a similiar approach, by using \u201c[look-though earnings](https://mastersinvest.com/newblog/2017/2/19/the-buffett-series-focus-on-the-earnings)\u201d to value Berkshire Hathaway and other holding companies. Subsidiaries should only pay dividends if they cannot re-invest capital in their business at a high hurdle rate.\n\nMy estimates for value per share are given below. The full assumptions can be found\u00a0[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lm1JZtfuQudOFddkLIAPrMp7RLtx5_Zj/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114836972199643253007&rtpof=true&sd=true). \n\n[Value per share](https://imgur.com/lZDYxbz)\n\n* Bear:  **\u20b9645**\n* Base: **\u20b9911**\n* Bull: **\u20b91,267**\n\nNotes:\n\n* The Coromandel stake represents \\~70% of EID Parry\u2019s value per share, so it forms a core part of the investment thesis. At current prices, you are essentially getting the sugar business and assets for \u201cfree\u201d, as the Coromandel stake and net cash are worth \u20b9755\n* If I valued the Coromandel stake at their current market price instead of using a discounted cash flow method, EID\u2019s 56% ownership of Coromandel equals \u20b91112 per share (after subtracting 25% in taxes) - 20% higher than my bull case estimate of \u20b9914. The markets seem to be valuing Coromandel with double-digit growth expectations for the next decade.\n\nI had initially bought EID Parry in March 2022 and added to my position subsequently, so my average cost is \u20b9508 (much lower than current levels). The stock now looks close to fairly valued, with the gap between price and value narrowing significantly since the beginning of 2024. The stock currently represents 10% of my India portfolio - I plan to hold it for the next several years (or ideally forever).\n\n[PPFAS](https://amc.ppfas.com/), a mutual fund I follow, has also invested in EID Parry since January 2024. However, it currently represents a small portion (0.2%) of their flexi-cap fund. They appear to have stopped adding to their position since February 2024, when the share price was around \u20b9600.\n\n# Future growth potential\n\nThe current stock price seems fairly valued, but provides some free \u201ccall options\u201d that I haven\u2019t consider yet in the valuation:\n\n* EID Parry\n   * Indian sugar consumption could grow significantly: Indian per-capita consumption is around\u00a0[22kg per year](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sugar-projections-consumption-per-capita_5jrzxx43xv37.pdf), while developed countries are at\u00a0[36kg per year](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sugar-projections-consumption-per-capita_5jrzxx43xv37.pdf).\n   * The Indian government drops the sugar export ban, leading to higher sugar realization prices\n   * The Indian government ramps up the Ethanol blending program to reduce reliance on energy imports (similiar to\u00a0[Brazil](https://www.energy-observer.org/resources/bioethnaol-brazilian-success-story))\n   * FMCG grows to become a significant part of the business (similiar to\u00a0[ITC](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/itcs-fmcg-business-set-to-touch-4-billion-mark/articleshow/111352796.cms)\u2019s successful scale-up)\n   * The freehold land bank owned by EID Parry, which they estimate to be valued at \u20b9394 Cr (or \u20b922 per share of EID Parry)\n* Coromandel could significantly ramp up export volumes: their current capacity is 4.5MMT (million metric ton), while the largest global crop nutrient manufacturers are close to\u00a0[20\\~30MMT](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1266558/plant-capacity-largest-fertilizer-manufacturers-worldwide/)\n\n# Risks\n\n* EID Parry\n   * Global sugar prices plummet lower than EID\u2019s production costs, leading to under-utilization and losses\n   * The Indian government sets the MSP (minimum support price) for sugar purchases from farmers and could end up squeezing EID\u2019s sugar margins.\n   * Poor monsoons or pest related issues in South India, leading to lower sugar cane yields\n* Coromandel faces significant litigation risks related to toxic chemical handling. The most recent example was a\u00a0[gas leak at Ennore on Dec 2023](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chennai/ennore-gas-leak-tamil-nadu-govt-panel-coromandel-pay-penalty-9144811/), which resulted in a fine of \u20b96\u00a0Cr.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nEID Parry appears to be well positioned, both on the production and consumption side of India\u2019s agriculture food chain.\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\nYou can view additional graphics in the article [here](https://opensourceinvestor.substack.com/p/eid-parry-nseeidparry-an-agriculture).\n\nThanks,  \nSharad  \n[OpenSourceInvestor @ Substack](https://opensourceinvestor.substack.com/)",

        "selftext": "Long read, but insightful\ud83d\udc4d\n\nCampa Cola was once a forgotten brand.\n\nToday, it's the reason Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are getting nervous.\n\nIn just 18 months, Campa has crossed \u20b91,000 crore in revenue.\n\nIt already holds more than 10% market share in sparkling beverages in some states.\n\nThat\u2019s huge.\nEspecially when you compare it to the giants.\n\nVarun Beverages, which bottles Pepsi in India, made \u20b914,703 crore in FY24.\nHindustan Coca-Cola Beverages earned \u20b914,236 crore.\n\nCampa is still smaller.\nBut its growth speed? Unmatched.\n\nAnd the secret?\nA \u20b910 cola bottle.\n\nYes, that\u2019s where the disruption began.\n\nA 200 ml PET bottle priced at \u20b910.\nHalf the price of Pepsi or Coke.\nSame fizz. Same feel. Half the price.\n\nFor a price-sensitive market like India, that\u2019s a powerful proposition.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just pricing.\n\nReliance gave retailers what others didn\u2019t\u2014higher margins.\n\nWhile Coca-Cola and Pepsi typically offer 3.5\u20135% margins, Campa offers 6\u20138%.\n\n- Retailers are happy.\n- They push Campa more.\n- Shelves are being reorganized.\n- Small shops are giving Campa prime space.\n\nThis shift is visible.\nNot just in metros\u2014but more in Tier II and Tier III cities.\nSmaller towns. Rural belts. Where affordability matters more.\n\nReliance isn\u2019t spending big on ads like Pepsi or Coke.\n\nBut they bought the co-presenting rights for IPL 2025. \u20b9200 crore invested in visibility.\nNow you see Campa Cola every match. Every timeout. Every break.\n\nThe distribution is classic Reliance.\n\nThrough 18,900+ stores, JioMart, Sahakari Bhandars, and even kiranas.\nCampa is sold where it matters most\u2014the last mile.\n\nAnd now, Campa is no longer alone.\n\nReliance has launched:\n\nRasKik \u2013 \u20b910 glucose drink\n\nSpinner \u2013 \u20b910 sports drink, co-created with Muttiah Muralitharan\n\nIndependence water \u2013 \u20b910 for 750 ml\n\nThis is not just a product play.\nIt\u2019s a portfolio play.\n\nReliance is betting big on India\u2019s \u20b910 price point.\nOne that was abandoned by MNCs years ago.\nThey\u2019re bringing it back. And making it mainstream.\n\nAnd the numbers show it\u2019s working.\n\nDistributors report 20\u201345 day wait times for Campa stock in some markets.\nDemand is outpacing supply.\n\nSome even say Campa is \"sold out for summer.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Coke and Pepsi are reacting.\nReducing prices. Offering combo deals. Launching new campaigns.\n\nBut they\u2019re following. Not leading.\n\nReliance is setting the pace.\n\nAll of this, from a company that entered FMCG just two years ago.\n\nDisruption in telecom started with \u20b90 calls.",

                "body": "I started my analysis with Reliance Industries\u2019 announcement that it is selling its 4.9% stake in Asian Paints, a stake it has held for 17 years since buying it in January 2008 for \u20b9500 crore, as reported by Economic Times (May 2025). This stake is now worth \u20b911,141 crore, based on Asian Paints\u2019 closing price of \u20b92,323 on May 13, 2025. This means Reliance is making a 24 times return on its original investment. The sale is being managed by Bank of America and is part of Reliance\u2019s broader plan to focus more on its core businesses, especially Jio (its telecom arm) and its green energy ventures. The decision also comes at a time when competition in the paints industry is rising.\n\nI looked into the financial journey of this stake over the years. The \u20b9500 crore investment grew significantly due to Asian Paints\u2019 strong stock performance over time. But recently, the stock has seen a sharp decline. In the past year alone, it has dropped 19.3% from its 52-week high of \u20b93,394, which was recorded on September 16, 2024. This fall has wiped off about \u20b951,000 crore from Asian Paints\u2019 market value, which reflects the broader stress in the market.\n\nI explored the competitive environment that\u2019s affecting Asian Paints. I found that its market share has dropped from 59% in FY24 to 52% in FY25. A major reason is the entry of Grasim Industries\u2019 new paint brand, Birla Opus, which quickly gained 3\u20134% market share in just the third quarter of FY25. Birla Opus is growing fast by using aggressive pricing, heavy advertising, and offering cashback incentives to painters. Industry insiders believe Birla Opus is aiming to reach \u20b910,000 crore in revenue within the next three years, which could shake up the market even more. On top of that, Asian Paints is also facing margin pressures due to rising crude oil prices, which affect the cost of raw materials. Reports suggest that if Grasim continues to grow at this pace and reaches a high single-digit market share, Asian Paints\u2019 share among the top nine paint companies might slip further to 50% by the end of FY25. This would make Birla Opus the fourth-largest player in the sector.\n\nI also looked at Asian Paints\u2019 performance during this challenging time. In Q2 of FY25, the company reported a 31.3% increase in net profit compared to the same quarter last year, reaching \u20b9780 crore. Revenue also grew by 19% to \u20b98,460 crore. This shows that the company is still growing, but its stock performance has been weak because of pressure across the industry. Other major players like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac have also seen big declines of around 24% in 2022. Even though Asian Paints has faced recent setbacks, its total market cap remains strong at \u20b9222,975 crore. However, it is currently trading at 11.5 times its book value, and its sales growth over the last five years has been a modest 10.9%. Its promoter holding stands at 52.6%, which suggests that those running the company still have faith in its future.\n\nTo understand the company\u2019s long-term outlook, I looked at its strengths. Despite the recent dip in stock price and growing competition, Asian Paints still has strong fundamentals. It has a wide distribution network and is known for constantly bringing innovation to its products. These strengths could help the company recover and grow in the long run. The paint sector as a whole is currently facing pricing pressure and slow volume growth, especially in the decorative segment where new players like Grasim are disrupting the market. But many industry experts believe that Asian Paints, with its experience and ability to adapt, could eventually regain lost ground through better products and stronger value offerings.\n\nIn summary, Reliance Industries is selling its 4.9% stake in Asian Paints for \u20b911,141 crore, which was originally bought for \u20b9500 crore in 2008, marking a 24-fold gain. The sale is part of Reliance\u2019s move to focus more on telecom and green energy. Meanwhile, Asian Paints is facing growing competition from new players like Birla Opus, which has caused its market share to drop from 59% to 52%. Its stock is also down 19.3% in the last year, leading to a \u20b951,000 crore fall in market value. Despite these issues, Asian Paints posted strong profit and revenue growth in Q2 FY25 and still has a solid foundation for future growth.\n\nIf you like my work then please support my subreddit as well.

During research, some news articles (from 2023, during demerger days) also seem to claim the same.\n\nIs this true?\n\nIf yes, I want to see the current status of this stake but am unable to find any information on JIOFIN holdings. Wanted to know as of 2025, how many shares of Reliance it holds. Maybe they have sold/bought some since 2023. Couldn't find any recent news/discussion on this. Wanted to calculate current value of these holdings to analyze JIOFIN valuation.\n\nI also tried reading JIOFIN and RELIANCE annual reports but couldn't find anything there, and these docs are too long and complicated anyway for me to fully understand. Can you find it there?\n\nAnyone knows about this? Can anyone research on this?\n\nIs there a website where we can easily see current holdings of various companies? I am not finding this info on screener or tickertape.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this stock? Is it a good time to enter?  \n  \nI am planning to buy now at 200-220 levels for medium term (1-3 years). May hold for long term 5-10 years if it performs a bit.",

Reliance New Energy Ltd. risks a \u20b9125 crore penalty for delaying its battery cell manufacturing plant under India's PLI scheme. The delay has impacted RIL's stock, which recently hit a 15-month low. Meanwhile, Ola Electric has begun trial production, highlighting Reliance's setback in India's battery manufacturing push. Analysts see long-term growth potential but advise caution in the short term.\n\n**Technically**, the stock is near a **strong support zone around \u20b91,094**. A **break below this level** could accelerate the downside, while holding above may trigger a pullback.",

Tata did have settings with Britishers, Birla's house was like a cafe house where all Congress meetings used to take place, Dhirubhai built his empire in the Congress era only (that time there was no transparency, open bribe system was prevalent. It was all before liberalisation and globalisation. SEBI wasn't there nor the social media). Ambani and Adani did exceptional in UPA 1 and 2 too. Nobody's gonna destroy their business over a political view. The opposition is beating a hollow drum and brainwashing people like you. The same opposition will be seen admiring these businessmen when it comes to power (if it does). Their own CMs didn't give a flying Fcuk to this drum beating and were happily asking these businessmen to come to their state and start a plant.",

This long-standing support level has proven reliable over the years, adding weight to its significance.\n\nOn the technical front, the weekly Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is still bearish mode but it is starting to turn upward below the zero line. On the valuation front, the stock is trading below -1 Standard Deviation (SD) of its 5 Year EV/EBITDA suggesting it may be undervalued at current levels\n\nThe key question now is whether Reliance will rebound from this pivotal zone or break the four-year-old trendline, signaling further downside.",

        "selftext": "\"Markets Reeling Under Reliance Selling\nBonus issue of Reliance Industries or RIL turned out to be a negative event for India's stock markets since it led to margin pressure on large investors. RIL enjoys highest weightage in India's two equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty and most FPIs, index funds, sovereign funds and large institutional investors hold RIL in their portfolio. These large category investors had pledged RIL stocks to avail trading limits from exchanges and their clearing corporations. In October, as the ex-bonus date of RIL was near, it spread panic among large investors and traders. RIL had announced 1:1 bonus and as per rules its share price was to be halved from around Rs 3000 to around Rs 1500 (ex-bonus). Due to this, all the large investors had to either bring in more collateral in terms of shares to replace RIL or simply put up more cash to fill up the collateral gap. The bonus shares that are allocated to existing shareholders take time to list on the exchanges and only then they can be placed as margin. This event led to majority of RIL collateral related positions to be liquidated or squared-off and hence a sudden major fall in Nifty and Sensex in October. RIL share price is down 20 percent from its 52-week high on an adjusted basis and Nifty and Sensex have shed nearly 10 percent from the all-time high levels.\"\n\nSharing this from his blog/article. Fascinating how everyone, especially myself that thought the 1:1 bonus of Reliance would be a positive for the investors.",

Isha Ambani is seen at Bollywood parties and other events, and I don't even want to talk about her role as Reliance Retail chairperson. Akash Ambani literally takes three-month breaks, sticking to watching IPL matches from his kingdom seat every MI game. Anant Ambani is busy creating an image for himself by buying chickens off the road and appearing with his wife at IPL matches (mind you, it was very cringe, IMO).\n\nNow, tell me, except for some old management faces and Mukesh Ambani, I bet Reliance would be stuck, and I won't be shocked if its growth hampers because of his own kids.\n\nReliance's stock has still not recovered much compared to other large companies. I myself hold Reliance shares, but honestly, I don't think there will be any substantial growth in the company unless Mukesh Ambani starts to educate his children on how to behave as chairpersons of a billion-dollar company.",

According to recent reports, this highly anticipated Initial Public Offering (IPO) is set to be one of the biggest in Indian history, potentially surpassing past records in terms of valuation and investor interest. The IPO is expected to give investors a rare opportunity to own a piece of one of India\u2019s most successful and fastest-growing telecom companies.\n\nJio has already transformed India\u2019s telecom landscape by making data affordable and accessible to millions, contributing to a digital revolution across the country. With its ambitious expansion plans in 5G, broadband, and digital services, Reliance Jio\u2019s market potential has drawn interest from global investors. Experts predict this IPO could not only become the largest in India\u2019s history but also set new standards in the tech and telecom sectors.\n\nThe funds raised through this IPO will reportedly be used to further enhance Jio\u2019s infrastructure, speed up 5G network expansion, and support future technology investments. Market analysts suggest that Jio\u2019s listing will have a significant impact on the Indian stock market, potentially attracting even more foreign investment into India\u2019s booming tech sector.\n\nWhat This Means for Investors:\nThe Jio IPO is expected to be highly competitive, with investors eager to participate. If successful, it could redefine IPO benchmarks in India, presenting an unprecedented investment opportunity in the telecom and tech space.\n\nStay tuned for more updates as Reliance Jio inches closer to this historic debut",

        "selftext": "*Original Source:* [*https://boringmoney.in/p/sbis-investment-in-jio-payments*](https://boringmoney.in/p/sbis-investment-in-jio-payments) *(my newsletter Boring Money. If you like what you read, do visit the original link to subscribe and receive future posts directly in your inbox)*\n\n\\--\n\nIn the financial world, if you\u2019re a company giving money to another company, it\u2019s likely for one of three reasons:\n\n1. You\u2019re lending it money and expect some fixed interest in return. The riskier the company you\u2019re lending to, the more interest you expect.\n2. You\u2019re investing in the company. If things work out, the value of your stake in the company goes up, and you make money. If not, you lose money, but that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s the game you\u2019re playing.\n3. You\u2019re investing, but the investment is strategic. You both bring something to the table, fill in each other\u2019s gaps. Eventually, you\u2019ll run a great business together and own a share of the profit.\n\nNice, clear differences. Right?\n\nIn 2018, the State Bank of India gave some money to Reliance Industries. The idea was that they would start a payments bank together called\u00a0[Jio Payments Bank](https://www.jiobank.in/). Reliance owned 70% of the company and SBI the remaining 30%.\n\nOn the face of it this was a strategic investment for SBI. But even at that time, this was a little unusual for a few reasons:\n\n1. Payments banks are a weird type of bank. They can take money from people as deposits, but can\u2019t lend that money out as loans. Making money is tough.\n2. SBI is a bank! It could do everything Jio Payments Bank could ever do, and much much more.\n3. Jio Payments Bank sounds like\u00a0*Reliance*, not like SBI.\n\nMaybe SBI saw great business potential in Jio Payments and was happy to be a part of it. But then\u00a0[this happened](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/jio-financial-to-acquire-sbi-stake-in-jio-payments-bank-for-rs-104-5-crore-125030400697_1.html)\u00a0last week:\n\n>The State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to divest its entire 17.8 per cent stake in Jio Payments Bank Limited, a joint venture between the state-owned bank and Jio Financial Services (JFS).\n\n>JFS will acquire the SBI\u2019s stake for \u20b9104.5 crore, after which Jio Payments Bank will become its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Reliance Group firm said on Tuesday.\n\nOkay maybe this wasn\u2019t a strategic investment after all but was financial? After eight years, SBI sold its entire stake back to Reliance itself for \u20b9104.5 crore ($12m).\n\nIntuitively we know that it wasn\u2019t the most successful investment. Jio Payments Bank is still a no-name in the payments industry. And it\u2019s been losing money like a tech startup (with a loss of \u20b950 crore last financial year) but with a revenue (\u20b930 crore last year) that doesn\u2019t show for it.\n\n# Investments in Jio Payments Bank\n\n|FY|Reliance Investment (\u20b9 Cr)|SBI Investment (\u20b9 Cr)|SBI\u2019s Share (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Total|444|79|\u2014|\n|FY 25|96\\*|0|18|\n|FY 24|4|0|23|\n|FY 23|80|0|23|\n|FY 22|22|9|30|\n|FY 21|0|0|30|\n|FY 20|0|0|30|\n|FY 19|162|70|30|\n\nBut just how bad a financial investment was this for SBI? In FY 2019, SBI invested \u20b970 crore ($8m). In FY 2022, it invested another \u20b99 crore ($1m). So that\u2019s a total of \u20b979 crore. Then in FY 2025, it\u2019s selling its stake for \u20b9104.54 crore. That\u2019s an annual return rate of 4.57%. \\[1\\]\n\nSBI would\u2019ve made more money had it invested in its own fixed deposits.\n\n# Not a lot of interest\n\nSo, SBI gave Reliance some money. Then Reliance gave it back with a 4.57% annualised return.\n\nThis sounds a bit like\u2026 a loan? Lending to start a startup is a no go, too risky for any bank\u2019s underwriting team. But an investment is fine! So maybe it made sense to just call it an investment instead?\n\nThe pieces of the puzzle fall into place if you treat SBI\u2019s investment as a low-interest loan. But hey, of course, it was just a strategic investment in a joint venture with Reliance that happened to not work out.\n\n  \n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I\u2019m referring to XIRR here. It\u2019s a simple\u00a0[calculation on Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15EicIHSg_fIauG3DN7xDtP5PhxXGBhJu7ghbV_7iI3A/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n\n\n*Original Source:* [*https://boringmoney.in/p/sbis-investment-in-jio-payments*](https://boringmoney.in/p/sbis-investment-in-jio-payments) ",

        "selftext": "I was learning about JIOFIN fundamentals and some YouTube videos claim JIOFIN holds 6.1% of Reliance and it is basically more like a holding company for now. During research, some news articles (from 2023, during demerger days) also seem to claim the same.\n\nIs this true?\n\nIf yes, I want to see the current status of this stake but am unable to find any information on JIOFIN holdings. Wanted to know as of 2025, how many shares of Reliance it holds. Maybe they have sold/bought some since 2023. Couldn't find any recent news/discussion on this. Wanted to calculate current value of these holdings to analyze JIOFIN valuation.\n\nI also tried reading JIOFIN and RELIANCE annual reports but couldn't find anything there, and these docs are too long and complicated anyway for me to fully understand. Can you find it there?\n\nAnyone knows about this? Can anyone research on this?\n\nIs there a website where we can easily see current holdings of various companies? I am not finding this info on screener or tickertape.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this stock? Is it a good time to enter?  \n  \nI am planning to buy now at 200-220 levels for medium term (1-3 years). May hold for long term 5-10 years if it performs a bit.",

Reliance New Energy Ltd. risks a \u20b9125 crore penalty for delaying its battery cell manufacturing plant under India's PLI scheme. The delay has impacted RIL's stock, which recently hit a 15-month low. Meanwhile, Ola Electric has begun trial production, highlighting Reliance's setback in India's battery manufacturing push. Analysts see long-term growth potential but advise caution in the short term.\n\n**Technically**, the stock is near a **strong support zone around \u20b91,094**.

Generate infinite shares, sell for infinite money.\n\nIf a company sells a billion shares, it\u2019s just splitting the same limited pie into a billion pieces. The total size of the pie remains the same. So of course there isn\u2019t going to be any infinite money.\n\nBut because of this infinite shares creation ability, companies can shrink the size of the piece of the pie with any particular shareholder. If I own 10 shares of a company with 100 shares, and the company magically creates another 900 shares and sells them to its favourite people, those people now have 900 while I\u2019m stuck with the same 10.\n\nThere are safeguards against this kind of stuff and it\u2019s not something that usually happens. I probably wouldn\u2019t be writing about it if it did usually happen. Late in December, SEBI\u00a0[issued an order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/dec-2024/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-bharat-global-developers-limited_90114.html)\u00a0against Bharat Global Developers, a 30-year old company whose only reason for existence was its capacity to defraud individual investors.\n\nBharat Global ran a classic pump-and-dump, and the first thing you do to run a pump-and-dump is hoard up on the shares of the company you\u2019re pumping. From SEBI\u2019s order:\n\n>\\[\u2026\\] the Company made two preferential allotment of shares \u2013 9.72 crore shares in April 2024 to 31 allottees and 35 lakh shares in August 2024 to 10 allottees. These large preferential allotments resulted in 99.5% of the shareholding being concentrated in the hands of these 41 allottees\u2026\n\nBharat Global sold more than 10 crore (100 million) shares to 41 of its favourite people. These 10 crore shares were the entire company! 99.5% of it at least. 99.5% is quite a sweet spot if you\u2019re looking to do a pump-and-dump.\n\n# The pump and the dump\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken about the general mechanics of a pump-and-dump\u00a0[before](https://boringmoney.in/p/youtube-is-great-for-pump-and-dumps#:~:text=The%20mechanics%20of%20it%20are%20known%20and%20simple%3A). It\u2019s reasonably straightforward:\n\n1. Find a relatively unknown company. Buy as many of its shares as you can.\n2. Scream your lungs out! The nicer the story about the company, the better.\n3. People thinking they\u2019re great stock pickers will buy the shares of the company. This is a dumb illiquid stock, so its price will shoot up.\n4. Sell to the suckers.\n5. ??? Profit.\n\nBharat Global sold the bulk of its shares in April 2024, first starting with 31 people. This was a \u20b997 crore sale. In August 2024, it sold another batch of shares to 10 more people for \u20b973 crore.\n\nWhen a company sells its shares in a \u201cpreferential allotment\u201d or in better words, to people that it chooses to, those people cannot sell their shares to the public right away. They\u2019re locked in for 6 months to ensure that the company isn\u2019t just distributing free money, and so that public investors have some time to evaluate and react to the company\u2019s actions.\n\nThe 31 people who bought Bharat Global\u2019s shares in April couldn\u2019t sell until at least October. As soon as October hit, the company started screaming its lungs out with announcements. Here\u2019s a slice of the kind of disclosures it made:\n\n1. \u20b9300 crore order! For potatoes! From McCain India Agro Pvt Ltd. Yeah, the frozen fries company.\n2. \u20b9650 crore order! From Tata Agro & Consumer Products. For tea leaves and dry fruits.\n3. \u20b9156 crore order! From UPL Agro\u2014groundnuts to extract oil from!\n4. A \u20b9120 crore order from Reliance Industries Ltd! For designing, engineering and constructing a refinery component.\n\nI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to say it, but all these orders were fake. SEBI went to each company and asked them about the orders. The companies from the disclosures don\u2019t even exist! Bharat Global just added a random \u201cAgro\u201d at the end of a bunch of popular companies\u2019 names to make their fake orders sound fancy.\n\nBetween 30th October and 11th December, 13 of Bharat Global\u2019s favourite 41 who were now out of the lock in, sold their shares. They made a massive \u20b9272 crore ($31 million) in profit. Here\u2019s an example of the scale of the profit:\n\n>One of the preferential allottees, namely Mahadev Manubhai Makvana who was allotted 37,82,000 shares in the first allotment, is also the Authorised Signatory in respect of two bank accounts of BGDL with Yes Bank and Axis Bank. The account opening date for Yes Bank was March 20, 2024. He offloaded 4,97,359 BGDL shares for INR 70,71,94,153 between November 01, 2024 and December 20, 2024, making a profit of approximately INR 70,22,20,563 against an investment of approximately INR 49,73,590.\n\nMahadev Manubhai Makvana (MMM?) invested \u20b949 lakh ($57k) and made \u20b970 crore ($8M). 155 times the initial investment! Uff.\n\nSEBI also discovered that MMM\u00a0*was*\u00a0Bharat Global. His name was on one of the company\u2019s bank accounts! If you\u2019re running a pump-and-dump, maybe don\u2019t put your name on the bank account of the company you\u2019re pumping.\n\nBoring Money is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\n# And then there was Reliance\n\nOf the four fake disclosures I highlighted, one is not the same as the others. When SEBI wrote to Reliance to figure out if they had indeed placed a \u20b9120 crore order with Bharat Global, here\u2019s what it got:\n\n>RIL submitted vide e-mail dated December 19, 2024 that BGDL had not supplied any material for the FCC project of RIL\u2019s refinery. RIL further submitted that BGDL (formerly known as Kkrrafton Developers Limited) had supplied only general construction materials to RIL for about INR 155 crore (including taxes) during the period from April 01, 2024 to September 30, 2024 which was not related to the FCC project.\n\nBharat Global\u2019s announcement about a \u20b9120 crore order was false, no surprises there, but Reliance told SEBI that there was\u00a0*another*\u00a0\u20b9155 crore order which was apparently legitimate and fulfilled?!\n\nBizarre. Very bizarre. Bharat Global was a company whose revenue was literally 0 for many years before it turned into a money grabbing vehicle. It lied about having subsidiaries which did not exist. The company changed its name 4 times in its lifetime. (Probably picked the name \u201cBharat Global\u201d because of how patriotic the pumpers-and-dumpers were.)\n\nThere was no business! There was never a business! All its disclosures were fake. And yet, somehow, out of nowhere, not only did it have a real \u20b9155 crore order from Reliance, but it also\u00a0*chose to*\u00a0make up a fake order when it could very well have just disclosed the real one instead?\n\nI think this takes the cake for anything I\u2019ve written until now. And I\u2019ve written about some\u00a0[weird stuff](https://boringmoney.in/p/embassy-reit-looks-at-a-fraud#:~:text=suspicious%20was%20suspicious.-,FIT%20AND%20PROPER,-If%20you%20were). I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. SEBI needs to jump on this thread and find some answers. But hey, until then, maybe I can guess?\n\nHere\u2019s some stuff about Reliance\u2019s payments from SEBI\u2019s order:\n\n>\u2026 data submitted by RIL shows that a payment of INR 57.22 crore was made to Kkrrafton Developers Limited on March 16, 2024, another 8.07 crore on March 19, 2024 and a last payment of INR 28.04 crore on August 12, 2024.\n\nand,\n\n>\\[\u2026\\] In this regard, from the bank statements of BGDL obtained from Indian Bank, it was observed that RIL made advance payments of Rs. 65.29 crore to BGDL in March 2024.\n\nReliance paid Bharat Global \u20b965 crore in advance and before it even raised an invoice for that money! In all, Reliance paid the company at \u20b993 crore, with the last payment in August. Now come on, Reliance is known to be pretty cut-throat, always getting the better half of a deal. Paying a zero-revenue company \u20b965 crore before it\u2019s even asked to doesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\nLet\u2019s put these events down in chronological order:\n\n1. In March 2024, Reliance paid Bharat Global \u20b965 crore out of the goodness of its heart.\n2. The next month in April, Bharat Global allotted shares worth \u20b997 crore to its favourite people.\n3. In August, Reliance paid another \u20b928 crore.\n4. Later in the same month, Bharat Global allotted another \u20b973 crore worth of shares to its favourite people.\n5. The money that Reliance paid Bharat Global did not show up in Bharat Global\u2019s financial statements.\n\nIs there a connection between the money Reliance paid Bharat Global and the money that Bharat Global\u2019s favourite people paid it? I don\u2019t know. Were those people really using Reliance\u2019s money to run a pump-and-dump? I have absolutely no idea. \\[1\\]\n\n# Playing saviour\n\nThe people that bought Bharat Global\u2019s shares in its second sale in August were to be locked in until February 2025. By late December, just before SEBI stepped in, Bharat Global\u2019s pumped-up price was at \u20b91300\u20146X the price that the August buyers got the shares at.\n\nThis post would\u2019ve probably been a two-part pump-and-dump series, had SEBI not identified the first pump-and-dump in time. For now, the 13 folks that made the \u20b9272 crore profit will have to give the money back. And the others that couldn\u2019t sell Bharat Global\u2019s shares in time will be stuck holding the bag.\u00a0\\[2\\]\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I really mean this! There are a lot of unknowns.\n\n\\[2\\] In the process of writing this I discovered that some of the 41 people are very obviously involved in other pump-and-dumps as well. Attempts at them, at least, if not successful ones. I\u2019ll probably write about it in a future MYSTERY POST.\n\nOriginal Source: [https://boringmoney.in/p/reliance-pays-a-hell-ton-of-money](https://boringmoney.in/p/reliance-pays-a-hell-ton-of-money?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=bharat+global+reliance)",

But as I said it's a very risky stock due to poor fundamentals and since it's moving in circuits you may remain stuck until there are buyers. So get rid of FOMO and invest in other stocks.

        "selftext": "In a surprising move, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has now entered the cryptocurrency and blockchain market.\n\nIt has established a partnership with the blockchain technology platform Polygon Labs. According to Business Standard, Polygon Labs will be working towards integrating Web3 capabilities into applications and services of Jio Platforms.\n\nAs a result of this collaboration, JioCoin has been introduced as a blockchain-based reward token. It is built on Ethereum Layer 2 technology. \n\nBut what will JioCoin do exactly?\n\nAs per India Today, it will reward users for engaging on Jio apps and services. It will be exclusively made available to users with Indian-based mobile numbers.\n\nCurrently, this reward programme is only available and active on the JioSphere application. It is a new web browser introduced by Jio and available on Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Android TV, and other platforms.\n\nHOW TO EARN THE JIOCOIN\n\nThe steps to earn a JioCoin are simple:\n\nFirst, you need to sign up for the JioCoins programme through the Profile section of the JioSphere app.\n\nAfter the sign-up is complete, you\u2019ll be able to earn JioCoins by engaging in activities like watching videos, reading articles, playing games, using VPN, browsing the web, using the incognito mode, and adding cards to the home screen.\n\nJioCoins are expected to be usable for Jio services like recharging mobile phones and broadband connections, shopping on JioMart, and activating OTT subscriptions. However, the exact details of the utilization aren\u2019t clear as of now.\n\nSPECULATIONS ABOUT THE JIOCOIN\n\nFor now, JioCoin is only available on Jio\u2019s new web browser called JioSphere. But it is expected for the company to soon expand the feature to other apps under its umbrella\u2014-like MyJio, JioCinema, and JioMart.\n\nThe official value of JioCoin remains undisclosed for now. As per Business Standard, speculations suggest that the value of the crypto coin could be Rs 43 per token.\n\nCRYPTO REFRESHER FOR YOU\n\nSpeaking of blockchain and Web3, what exactly are these terms?\n\nWeb3 is the third generation of the World Wide Web. It operates on the principles of being open to everybody through decentralization. \n\nSimply put, it is more transparent in nature and gives users more control of their data.\n\nAs for blockchain, think of it as a digital database. This database operates on linked blocks across a network of computers. It maintains records of orders, transactions, payments, and accounts and ensures that they cannot be altered or changed.",

Before I begin, caveat: Please be respectful. Whatever, your personal opinion of the Ambanis, set it aside to focus purely on the financial implications being discussed. \n\n**RIL is a Rs 21 trillion market cap company controlled/owned about 50% by the Ambani family either directly or through promoter group shell companies.** This is a pretty hefty ownership percentage. \n\n**Is it possible for the promoter group to sell even 10% of the company** without causing a significant decline in share price? \n\n**How does RIL get a PE of 30 when most of its revenue comes from the Jamnagar refinery** which is a low PE business worldwide? \n\nI'm sure someone will say that's because they get a lot of net income from Digital Services, and my question will be - **how are they getting 50% margins on that business?** Is this typical? \n\nIf the Ambani family is not selling stake, then they probably manage their cash flow with RIL dividends. On top of that, **are they known to pledge their shares for cash flow?** \n\n\n\n",

JIO: It's entirely possibly there's more subscriber growth that can be picked up for this business but JIO penetration among Indian consumers is pretty high. A comparable business with a large number of subscribers in the US is AT&T. And their PE is 10. \n\n2. Retail: I'm assuming we are referring to apparel and cosmetic retail, not grocery. I know the Costcos of the world get insane PEs but that's mostly because of the subscriber model, which no one has tried in India yet. I looked up Zara's PE ratio and that's 26. So perhaps 30 is fair for Reliance. \n\n3. Renewables: This is where it gets fun :). PV panels is a low margin business completely dominated by the Chinese. Green hydrogen and fuel cell isn't exactly doing great right now and adoption is very limited. If they make a breakthrough in battery tech, then of course the sky is the limit. Perhaps they are investing in battery R&D? \n\nI think siphoned off is a pretty bold claim. I've never seen any allegations of accounting malpractices at Reliance. \n\nFor them to fund lifestyle from other investments, they would have to be very significant. Curious what they could be :)",

If you like what you read, do visit the original link to subscribe and receive future posts directly in your inbox)*\n\n--\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken about this a\u00a0[couple](https://boringmoney.in/p/vedanta-wants-to-split-into-six)\u00a0of\u00a0[times](https://boringmoney.in/p/zee-merge-with-sony-shirpur). If you\u2019re a billionaire, you probably like having separate companies for separate businesses. One of your businesses might be old, boring and predictable. It\u2019s probably what brings in a stable income every month. Another of your businesses might be batshit crazy with years to go before it sees a profit. If the wacko blows up, you don\u2019t want the reliable uncle to go down with it.\n\nThis insulation is nice for you, and it\u2019s nice for your investors who can pick and choose the companies they like and ditch the ones they don\u2019t. In general, having multiple companies doing different stuff is a good thing.\n\nSometimes, though, these companies might intersect. If one of your companies is, say, a large retail company, and the other is a payments company, it might make sense to plug your payments company into your retail company wherever you can. That way, your payments company can get some business, and your retail company can hopefully get a discounted price. \\[1\\]\n\nLet\u2019s change the example. Let\u2019s say business hasn\u2019t been great for your retail company. Now, what if you created\u00a0a\u00a0*new*\u00a0company just so that it could go and buy stuff from your retail company? That\u2019s probably not too nice. From the Ken\u00a0[last week](https://the-ken.com/story/who-stands-to-gain-the-most-from-jio-financials-us4-3b-lease-deal-hint-not-jio-financial/?searchTerm=jio):\n\n>Reliance Industries (RIL) is back with yet another one-of-its-kind deal structuring\u2014this time, targeting three birds with one stone.\n\n>The latest instance of the deal-structuring chops of the Mukesh Ambani-controlled oil-to-retail behemoth lies in a proposal from its youngest child, Jio Financial Services. The financial services entity wants to buy and lease customer premises equipment/devices and telecom gears, such as airfibre, phones, and laptops, worth Rs 36,000 crore (US$4.3 billion) over the two years ending March 2026.\n\n>There seems nothing exceptional about it, except that Jio Financial wants to do this big deal in-house. Its subsidiary, Jio Leasing Services, plans to buy the equipment from group company Reliance Retail and lease it to customers of Reliance Jio Infocomm, RIL\u2019s telecommunications arm.\n\nMukesh Ambani owns both Reliance Industries and Jio Financial Services. \\[2\\]\u00a0Jio Financial Services\u2014which doesn\u2019t even have a financial services business yet\u2014has a subsidiary called Jio Leasing Services. This subsidiary, Jio Leasing, is going to buy some electronics from Reliance Retail, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries. Jio Leasing will then lease these electronics, which I guess would be stuff like routers, modems, antennas, to customers of Reliance Jio, the telecom company which like Reliance Retail is a subsidiary of Reliance Industries.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t44whu416p7d1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbfb55c36f14b254208df7e6a55dec36722bbbaf\n\nAlso\u2014Jio Leasing is going to buy \u20b936,000 crore ($4.4 billion) worth of stuff?! Jio Financial, which owns Jio Leasing, is an NBFC whose primary business is supposedly to lend out money, charge an interest, get repaid. It\u2019s not begun doing that yet, but it is spending $4.4 billion over two years to lend out some routers and modems instead? \\[3\\]\n\nYou know what? Fine. Maybe routers are going to replace fiat money very soon. And all lending and borrowing is going to be denominated in TP-Link routers. Maybe the RBI is going to ask banks to ditch their Rupee reserves and switch to routers instead.\n\nEven so, why does Jio Financial buy those routers from Reliance Retail? Here\u2019s the company\u2019s rationale\u00a0[from its postal ballot notice](https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/corporate/JIOFIN_23052024125038_PostalBallotNotice.pdf)\u00a0asking shareholders to approve this transaction (among others): \\[4\\]\n\n>RRL \\[Reliance Retail\\] is in the business of dealing in customer premises equipment, enterprise devices and other telecom devices. RRL is able to procure these goods at competitive prices due to large volumes and RRL will be providing these devices to JLSL \\[Jio Leasing\\] at cost plus agreed margin.\n\nUmm.. Jio Financial is buying $4.4 billion worth of stuff. Sure, Reliance Retail might be able to procure these goods at competitive prices. But couldn\u2019t Jio Financial? If I was spending $4.4 billion, I wouldn\u2019t go to a retailer. I\u2019d go to the manufacturers and pick the one that danced the best.\n\n\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] This is happening! In addition to Jio Leasing Services buying from Reliance Retail, another subsidiary of Jio Financial\u2014Jio Payment Solutions\u2014is going to manage payments for Reliance Retail\u2019s stores as well as website. In addition to, of course, buying equipment from Reliance Retail itself. It seems to me like buying from Reliance Retail is every Jio Financial subsidiary\u2019s rite of passage.\n\n\\[2\\] I mean, they\u2019re both listed companies so Ambani doesn\u2019t technically \u201cown\u201d them. He just owns huge chunks of both.\n\n\\[3\\] At the end of March 2024, Jio Financial had \u20b924,000 crore in total assets. How is it going to pay \u20b936,000 crore to Reliance Retail? Unfortunately, they don\u2019t tell us that. Hopefully it\u2019s something funny so that I can write about it.\n\n\\[4\\] Since the possible conflict of interest in transactions like this is obvious, Jio Financial has to take shareholder approval for them to go through. Considering Ambani owns nearly 50% of Jio Financial, it probably will go through.\n\n\n\n  \n*Original Source:* [*https://boringmoney.in/p/jio-financial-wants-to-lend-routers*](https://boringmoney.in/p/jio-financial-wants-to-lend-routers) ",

        "selftext": "We have all botched the execution because we failed to check something such as major economic releases, the news flow, the overnight market closes, or liquidity. Every market participant probably wishes they had some magical wand that would do more of what works and less of what doesn\u2019t for every single order. Well, it turns out there is a simple free tool that other high strained professions have been using for over a century that guarantees superior execution. Pilots, surgeons, soldiers, deep sea divers all have one thing in common. They use checklists. In those fields, mistakes can be fatal. Checklists do save lives and money.\n\n# Checklists save lives and money\n\nThe evidence for checklist effectiveness is overwhelming, particularly in high-stakes environments like trading where errors can be costly. Research from the aviation industry provides additional insights. A NASA study in the 1980s found that even experienced pilots made critical errors when dealing with routine emergencies. The introduction of mandatory checklists reduced these errors by over 80%. Today, no commercial pilot would consider take-off without running through their pre-flight checklist, regardless of their experience level.\n\nIn his landmark study published in The New England Journal of Medicine (2009), Dr. Atul Gawande demonstrated that implementing a simple surgical checklist reduced deaths by 47% and major complications by 36% across eight hospitals worldwide. This research became the foundation for his fantastic book \u201cThe Checklist Manifesto\u201d and sparked a global revolution in medical safety protocols.\n\nResearch by behavioural finance experts demonstrates similar benefits on the markets. A 2016 study published in the Journal of Trading examining institutional trading desks found that firms using standardized pre-trade checklists experienced:\n\n* Fewer compliance violations\n* Reduction in \u201cfat finger\u201d trading errors\n* Improvement in average trade execution:\n\n# The benefits of checklists\n\nThe benefits of checklists are:\n\n* Ensure that critical steps aren\u2019t missed: this is why commercial flights are the safest means of transportation\n* Reduce reliance on memory: this is particularly useful in stressful situations where cognitive abilities are reduced\n* Standardise process: anyone can take over at a moment\u2019s notice\n* Emotional distance: this is just a routine check, not an inquisition or a profession of faith\n\nChecklists work because they address fundamental limitations in human cognitive processing. Psychological research shows that under stress, our working memory becomes impaired and our attention span shortens. Surgeons or soldiers are under enormous pressure. So, saving just a little bit of extra mental real estate can sometimes be the difference between life or death.\n\n# Adoption of checklists in the financial services\n\nIf checklists are particularly useful in stressful environment, improve performance, then they should be standard practice in the financial services industry. It should be an endless pissing contest between financial influencers for the slickest checklist trophy. Besides, as all houses continuously strive to improve execution, checklists should be a standard basic tool like commercial airlines.\n\nAnd yet, the mere allusion to a checklist will be promptly met with thinly veiled contempt. Experienced market participants often view checklists as beneath their expertise. As Atul Gawande noted in his research, this resistance is strongest among the most highly trained professionals. They view checklists as a crutch for beginners or, worse, an insult to their competence. Pension funds baby sitters, who believe that investing is akin to an art form simply cannot reduce it to a mechanistic box ticking or a paint by number exercise.\n\nSecondly, the markets\u2019 fast-paced nature creates constant pressure to skip steps or rush through the process. Market participants are afraid that the markets would run away from them. Under stress, traders tend to abandon their checklists precisely when they need them most.\n\nThirdly, the ever changing nature and complexity of the markets supposedly precludes the viability of of routine checklists. Surgeons do not perform the same operations every day. Soldiers do not fight the same battle twice. Pilots don\u2019t have the luxury of improvising solutions mid-air. Their jobs are fraught with unexpected complications. It is precisely the use of checklists for contingencies that save patients lives, bring the boys home and land aircrafts. Jobs with great variability and adaptability still make use of checklists. And yet, how many times did we end up with subpar execution simply because we forgot to check a couple of things in the pre-open? A simple checklist would have prevented adverse market impact.\n\nFinally, checklists are boring. Good. If you are in the game for the thrill, you are not in the markets for the money. It takes a few minutes to execute a checklist before the opening. Those few minutes will add a few basis points trade after trade. Those few basis points compound over time. All it takes is a few percentage points of excess returns to rise above the pack and reach stardom status. Every basis point counts.\n\n# What would an effective checklist could look like?\n\nThe key to effective checklists lies in their design. Research from clinical decision-making environments suggests the most effective checklists are:\n\n* Brief (5\u20139 items): anything beyond 10 items should be a separate checklist\n* Focus on critical failure points\n* Use precise, actionable language with no ambiguity\n* Are regularly reviewed and updated\n\nA basic checklist for any market participant would encompass three major areas:\n\n1. The broader market to minimise adverse execution: major economic release, news flow, overnight market closes, market sentiment\n2. Risk management: position sizing, limits, liquidity, correlation with other holdings\n3. Mental state: euphoric or depressed traders are poor traders\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe empirical evidence is clear: checklists don\u2019t just reduce errors \u2014 they improve performance particularly for experienced professionals. They reduce dependence on memory and free up some mental real estate to execute better. Checklists represent one of the most powerful tools available for converting pitfalls or genius moves into routine best practices.\n\nOne more thing. I used to be a die-hard Bloomberg user. I have been using [eodhd.com](http://eodhd.com/). I love it. Everything is so intuitive, support is amazing and price attractive unlike BBG.\n\nPS: We are looking for a few volunteers to test our AI trading journal. DM to get on the waiting list and webinars",

        "selftext": "[*I originally posted this article on my blog*](https://nexustrade.io/chat)*, but thought to share it here to reach a wider community. TL;DR: I used AI to analyze every single stock. You can try it for free by either:*\n\n* [*Looking through the list of stocks sorted by ranking*](https://nexustrade.io/stock-reports)\n* [*Using the AI Chat and asking it to find stocks that conform to your criteria*](https://nexustrade.io/chat)\n\nI can already feel the vitriol from the anti-AI mafia, ready to jump in the comments to scream at me about \u201cstochastic parrots\u201d.\n\nAnd in their defense, I understand where their knee-jerk reaction comes from. Large language models don\u2019t truly *understand* (whatever the hell that means), so how is it going to *know* if Apple is a good stock or not?\n\nThis reaction is unfounded. There is a large body of research growing to support the efficacy of using LLMs for financial analysis.\n\nFor example, [this paper from the University of Florida](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/document/2024-04/4.19.24%20Alejandro%20Lopez%20Lira%20ChatGPT_V3.pdf#:~:text=scores%20and%20examine%20the%20predictive,in%20forecasting%20stock%20market%20returns) suggests that ChatGPT\u2019s inferred sentiment is a better predictor of next-day stock price movement than traditional sentiment analysis.\n\nAdditionally, [other researchers have used LLMs to create trading strategies](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.18103v1#:~:text=In%20Table%C2%A01%20%2C%20the%20prediction,based) and found that the strategies that were created outperform traditional sentiment methods. Even financial analysts at Morgan Stanley [use a GPT-Powered assistant to help train their analysts.](https://www.morganstanley.com/press-releases/morgan-stanley-research-announces-askresearchgpt)\n\nIf all of the big firms are investing into LLMs, there\u2019s got to be a reason.\n\nAnd so, I thought to be a little different than the folks at Morgan Stanley. I decided to make this type of analysis available to everybody with an internet connection.\n\nHere\u2019s exactly what I did.\n\n# Using a language model to analyze every stock\u2019s fundamentals and historical trend\n\nA stock\u2019s \u201cfundamentals\u201d are one of the only tangible things that give a stock its value.\n\nThese metrics represent the company\u2019s underlying financial health and operational efficiency. Revenue provides insight into demand \u2014 are customers increasingly buying what the company sells?\n\nIncome highlights profitability, indicating how effectively a company manages expenses relative to its earnings.\n\nOther critical metrics, such as profit margins, debt-to-equity ratio, and return on investment, help us understand a company\u2019s efficiency, financial stability, and growth potential. When we feed this comprehensive data into a large language model (LLM), it can rapidly process and analyze the information, distilling key insights in mere minutes.\n\nNow this isn\u2019t the first time I used an LLM to analyze every stock. I\u2019ve done this before and admittedly, I fucked up. So I\u2019m making some changes this time around.\n\n**What I tried previously**\n\nPreviously, when I used an LLM to analyze every stock, I made numerous mistakes.\n\n[Link to previous analysis](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/i-used-ai-to-analyze-3-432-us-stocks-some-of-the-best-stocks-i-found-surprised-me-5ef3d92cbca9)\n\nThe biggest mistake I made was pretended that a stock\u2019s earnings *at a particular period in time* was good enough.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to know that NVIDIA made $130 billion in 2024. You also need to know that they made $61 billion in 2023 and $27 billion in 2022. This allows us to fully understand **how NVIDIA\u2019s revenue changed over time.**\n\nSecondly, the original reports were far too confusing. I relied on \u201cfiscal year\u201d and \u201cfiscal period\u201d. Naively, you think that stocks all have the same fiscal calendar, but that\u2019s not true.\n\nThis made comparisons confusing. Users were wondering why I haven\u2019t posted 2024 earnings, when they report those earnings in early 2025. Or, they were trying to compare the fiscal periods of two different stocks, not understanding that they don\u2019t align with the same period of time.\n\nSo I fixed things this year.\n\n**How I fixed these issues**\n\n\\[Pic: UI of the stock analysis tool\\] (https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1\\*7eJ4hGAFrTAp6VYHR6ksXQ.png)\n\nTo fix the issues I raised, I\u2026\n\n* **Rehydrated ALL of the data**: I re-ran the stock analysis on all US stocks in the database across the past decade. I focused on the actual report year, not the fiscal year\n* **Included historical data:** Thanks to the decrease in cost and increase in context window, I could stuff far more data into the LLM to perform a more accurate analysis\n* **Include computed metrics:** Finally, I also computed metrics, such as year-over-year growth, quarter-over-quarter growth, compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and more and inputted it into the model\n\nI sent all of this data into an LLM for analysis. To balance between accuracy and cost, I chose Qwen-Turbo for the model and used the following system prompt.\n\n[Pic: The system prompt I used to perform the analysis](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ONQDa69mYcZ8dAVrBhhlgw.png)\n\nThen, I gave a detailed example in the system prompt so the model has a template of *exactly* how to respond. To generate the example, I used the best large language model out there \u2013 Claude 3.7 Sonnet.\n\nFinally, I updated my UI to be more clear that we\u2019re filtering by the actual year (not the fiscal year like before).\n\n[Pic: A list of stocks sorted by how fundamentally strong they are](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Kr7TXp4zTTSSQD_Zm_E_RQ.png)\n\nYou can access this analysis for free at [NexusTrade.io](https://nexustrade.io/stock-reports)\n\nThe end result is a comprehensive analysis for every US stock.\n\n[Pic: The analysis for APP](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*_K9tlgTyUqvQTMAKc1yAJw.png)\n\nThe analysis doesn\u2019t just have a ranking, but it also includes a detailed summary of *why* the ranking was chosen. It summaries the key financial details and helps users understand what they mean for the company\u2019s underlying business.\n\nUsers can also use the [AI chat in NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io/chat) to find fundamentally strong stocks with certain characteristics.\n\nFor example, I asked the AI the following question.\n\n>What are the top 10 best biotechnology stocks in 2023 and the top 10 in 2024? Sort by market cap for tiebreakers\n\nHere was its response:\n\n[Pic: Fetching fundamentally strong biiotech stocks. The AI retrieved stocks like REGN, SMLR, and JNJ for 2023, and ISRG, ZTS, and DXCM for 2024](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*MirluKlkMOsB3bKc7rQBgQ.png)\n\nWith this feature, you can create a shortlist of fundamentally strong stocks. Here are some surprising results I found from this analysis:\n\n# Some shocking findings from this analysis\n\n**The Magnificent 7 are not memes \u2013 they are fundamentally strong**\n\n[Pic: Looking at some of the Magnificent 7 stocks](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ZjcmWCVoX8OQMuXSOHHorw.png)\n\nSurprisingly (or unsurprisingly), the Mag 7 stocks, which are some of the most popular stocks in the market, are all fundamentally strong. These stocks include:\n\n* [AAPL (Apple)](https://nexustrade.io/stock/AAPL)\n* [AMZN (Amazon)](https://nexustrade.io/stock/AMZN)\n* [GOOGL (Alphabet)](https://nexustrade.io/stock/GOOGL)\n* [META (Meta)](https://nexustrade.io/stock/META)\n* [MSFT (Microsoft)](https://nexustrade.io/stock/MSFT)\n* [NVDA (Nvidia)](https://nexustrade.io/stock/NVDA)\n* [TSLA (Tesla)](https://nexustrade.io/stock/TSLA)\n\nSo these stocks, even Tesla, are not entirely just memes. They have the business metrics to back them up.\n\n**NVIDIA is the best semiconductor stock fundamentally**\n\n[Pic: Comparing Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*p1h5F_oRsBJq5EE0KYx0aw.png)\n\nIf we look at the fundamentals of the most popular semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA stands out as the best. With this analysis, Intel was rated a 2/5, AMD was rated a 4/5, and NVDA was rated a 4.5/5. These metrics also correlate to these stock\u2019s change in stock price in 2024.\n\n**The best \u201cno-name\u201d stock that I found.**\n\nFinally, one of the coolest parts about this feature is the ability to find good \u201cno-name\u201d stocks that aren\u2019t being hyped on places like Reddit. Scouring through the list, one of the best \u201cno-name\u201d stocks I found was [AppLovin Corporation.](https://nexustrade.io/stock/APP)\n\n[Pic: APP\u2019s fundamentals includes 40% YoY growth consistently](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*xnu069BErIi3-lnbfI2NlQ.png)\n\nSome runner-ups for this prize includes [MLR](https://nexustrade.io/stock/MLR), [PWR](https://nexustrade.io/stock/PWR), and [ISRG](https://nexustrade.io/stock/ISRG), a few stocks that have seen **crazy returns** compared to the broader market!\n\nAs you can see, the use-cases for these AI generated analysis are endless! However, this feature isn't the silver bullet that's guaranteed to make you a millionaire; you must use it responsibly.\n\n# Caution With These Analysis\n\nThese analysis were generated using a large language model. Thus, there are several things to be aware of when you're looking at the results.\n\n* **Potential for bias:** language models are not infallible; it might be the case that the model built up a bias towards certain stocks based on its training data. You should always scrutinize the results.\n* **Reliance on underlying data**: these analysis are generated by inputting the fundamentals of each stock into the LLM. If the underlying data is wrong in any way, that will make its way up to the results here. While EODHD is an extremely high-quality data provider, you should always double-check that the underlying data is correct.\n* **The past does NOT guarantee a future result:** even if the analysis is spot-on, and every single stock analyst agrees that a stock might go up, that reality might not materialize. The CEO could get sick, the president might unleash tariffs that affects the company disproportionally, or any number of things can happen. While these are an excellent starting point, they are not a replacement for risk management, diversification, and doing your own research.\n\n# Concluding Thoughts\n\nThe landscape of financial analysis has been forever changed by AI, and we\u2019re only at the beginning. What once required expensive software, subscriptions to financial platforms, and hours of fundamental analysis is now available to everybody for free.\n\nThis democratization of financial analysis means individual investors now have access to the same powerful tools that were previously exclusive to institutions and hedge funds.\n\nDon\u2019t let the simplicity fool you \u2014 these AI-powered stock analyses aren\u2019t intended to be price predictors. They\u2019re comprehensive examinations of a company\u2019s historical performance, growth trajectory, fundamental health, and valuation. While no analysis tool is perfect (AI or otherwise), having this level of insight available at your fingertips gives you an edge that simply wasn\u2019t accessible to retail investors just a few years ago.\n\nReady to discover potentially undervalued gems or confirm your thesis on well-known names? Go to [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io/stock-reports) and explore the AI-generated reports for yourself. Filter by year or rating to shift through the noise. Better yet, use the AI chat to find stocks that match your exact investing criteria.\n\nThe tools that were once reserved for Wall Street are now in your hands \u2014 it\u2019s time to put them to work.",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, any $BLNK investors here? If you\u2019ve been following $BLNK, you probably remember the scandal after the report that accused the company of \u201cvastly exaggerating\u201d its EV charging network back in 2020 and the 37% stock drop afterward. Here\u2019s a recap of what happened and the latest news on the $3.75M settlement.\n\n\n\nIn August 2020, [Culper Research claimed](https://culperresearch.com/research-archive) that only 15% of BLINK\u2019s 15,000 chargers were functional (They even included photos and user interviews, tho).\n\n\n\nSoon after, [Mariner Research Group called](https://marinerresearchgroup.com/2020/08/19/dont-get-charged-up-on-blnk-questionable-origin-story-management-history-and-product-issues-portend-potential-90-downside/) Blink \"overvalued\" and criticized the company\u2019s reliance on federal subsidies and CEO Michael Farkas\u2019s $7 million compensation, which they said didn\u2019t align with performance.\n\n  \n\n\nThe market didn\u2019t take these accusations lightly. Within 48 hours, Blink\u2019s stock dropped 37% and, despite Blink\u2019s efforts to counter these allegations\u2014calling them a \u201cmanipulative short-seller campaign\u201d\u2014the damage was done.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ex2chxszl3oe1.png?width=2143&format=png&auto=webp&s=463ba06a0e0d0d0102c0c6c7a3acef93419e67cf\n\n\n\nBy late 2020, investors filed a lawsuit, alleging that Blink hid info about its network size, partnerships, and overall growth prospects.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNow, [Blink has already agreed to a $3.75M settlement](https://11thestate.com/cases/blink-investor-settlement) to resolve these claims, and even if the deadline has passed, they\u2019re accepting late claims. So, if you held $BLNK shares during that time, you might be eligible to file for compensation.\n\n\n\nFast forward to today, Blink is still facing significant challenges. Its stock remains far below its highs, and it announced a 14% workforce reduction to save $9 million annually (which is bad news, tbh). On the brighter side, however, they already surpassed 100,000 chargers sold, deployed, or contracted globally. So maybe they\u2019ll have better news soon.\n\n\n\nAnyways, has anyone here held $BLNK back then? If so, how much were your losses?\n\n",

        "selftext": "**Summary**  \n2025 is shaping up to be a reckoning year for the Treasury market, and it all boils down to debt management. With $3.6 trillion in short-term maturities rolling over, the shift from Janet Yellen\u2019s short-term borrowing binge to Scott Bessent\u2019s long-end-focused strategy feels less like a pivot and more like a survival maneuver. The Treasury\u2019s plan to issue longer-term debt introduces supply-side pressures that could steepen the yield curve and elevate borrowing costs. It\u2019s Econ 101 supply-demand mechanics\u2014but on a trillion-dollar scale.\n\nFull article (disclosure: I wrote it): [https://tetractysresearch.com/p/running-into-a-wall](https://tetractysresearch.com/p/running-into-a-wall)  \n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Short-Term Debt Reckoning:** Yellen\u2019s reliance on Treasury bills (T-bills) was a liquidity sugar rush, keeping costs low and flexibility high. Now, the 2025 maturity wall will test whether we can refinance at the long end without snapping the market\u2019s resolve.\n* **RRP and Liquidity Drains:** Reverse Repo balances have dwindled from $2.5T to $250B, signaling less of a cushion to absorb liquidity shocks. This complicates QT as future Treasury issuance drains liquidity more directly.\n* **Long-End Supply Pressure:** Pension funds and insurers aren\u2019t nimble enough to absorb a wave of long-duration issuance without demanding a term premium. Expect steeper curves, rising yields, and a squeeze on fiscal stability.\n\n**Fed Drama and Trade Insights:**  \nThe Fed\u2019s \u201choliday inflation tinkering\u201d means inflation forecasts will see more revisions than a first draft of War and Peace. This volatility aligns with my thesis on heightened inflation risk for 2025, underscoring the importance of hedges in both equities and rates.\n\n**Bonus Note:**  \nThe December NFP print validated the themes in this piece. Strong jobs headline? Sure, but wage growth is diverging, and the labor market's fragility mirrors the financial system\u2019s eroding buffers. Treasury yields are climbing, liquidity is tightening, and inflation is resurfacing. Buckle up\u2014this isn\u2019t just a marathon, it\u2019s a mountain climb.\n\n**Final Trades to Watch:**\n\n* Long ZT with half-year 20-delta calls: Hedge for monetary tightness impacting Main Street.\n* Mix of March/April 20-delta puts on ES and NQ: Cheap hedges worth buying while the market catches its breath.\n* Stay short ZB: Rising long-end yields will weigh on equity valuations and liquidity-sensitive assets.\n\nIn short: The debt wall isn\u2019t just a challenge for the Treasury; it\u2019s a seismic shift for markets. Position accordingly.\n\nWould love to hear the sub\u2019s thoughts\u2014especially from those tracking short-end vs. long-end dynamics or grappling with inflation volatility in your trades.",

        "selftext": "# Introduction\n\nTempus is a technology company advancing precision medicine through the practical application of artificial intelligence in healthcare. ***With one of the world\u2019s largest libraries of multimodal data, and an operating system to make that data accessible and useful***, Tempus provides\u00a0AI-enabled\u00a0precision medicine solutions to physicians to deliver personalized patient care and in parallel facilitates discovery, development and delivery of optimal therapeutics. The goal is for each patient to benefit from the treatment of others who came before by providing physicians with tools that learn as the company gathers more data.\n\n**The company's focus is on developing Intelligent Diagnostics, using AI to personalize laboratory tests for more insightful results.**\n\nTempus AI's business model is built on three main product lines:\n\n**Genomics:** This involves providing next-generation sequencing (NGS) diagnostics, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) profiling, molecular genotyping, and other anatomic and molecular pathology testing. These services are offered to healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, researchers, and other third parties.5\n\n**Data and Services:** Tempus AI leverages its Genomics product line to create a de-identified database that is then commercialized to pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners.4 This data is used to support drug discovery and development through two key products:\n\n**Insights** (licensing and analysis of de-identified records) and **Trials** (matching patients to clinical trials).\n\n**AI Applications:** This product line focuses on the development and provision of algorithm-based diagnostics, software as a medical device, and clinical decision support tools. Revenue from AI Applications is currently reported within the Data and Services line item due to its immateriality.\n\nTempus AI believes that its position as both a healthcare provider and a technology company provides a significant advantage in the realm of precision medicine. The company emphasizes the importance of technology, investing heavily in its Platform to ensure efficient data generation, ingestion, and structuring. However, Tempus AI acknowledges the inherent risks and challenges associated with AI, such as accuracy, bias, data privacy, and cybersecurity. The company is also actively engaged in managing the legal and regulatory complexities surrounding AI in healthcare.\n\nA substantial majority of Tempus AI's genomic testing focuses on clinical applications, with oncology serving as the primary disease area. This emphasis on clinical oncology testing is evident in the significant revenue generated by the company from these services. Further solidifying its position, Tempus AI actively seeks to secure reimbursement for its oncology tests from both commercial payers and government programs like Medicare. The company has made progress in increasing average reimbursement rates for NGS tests in oncology, acknowledging that this aspect remains crucial for future growth and profitability. This widespread adoption of Tempus AI's oncology genomic testing services by physicians and hospital systems fuels a continuous influx of invaluable patient data. This data forms the cornerstone of the company's **\"walled garden\" data strategy**\u2014a key competitive advantage that provides Tempus AI with a unique and expansive dataset for analysis and innovation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis discussion will describe how Tempus AI will be a world leading health agentic AI because of its following moat:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Walled off data.** Data outside public domain so no other AI can train on it. Tempus AI has a monopoly on this dataset to train on.\n\n\u00a0\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Tempus AI's Intelligent Diagnostics could provide patients and physicians with more personalized and actionable information.** By combining laboratory test results with other multimodal datasets like clinical and imaging data, Tempus AI aims to provide more insightful results that are tailored to individual patients. This could lead to more precise diagnoses and treatment plans.\n\n\u00a0\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Access to clinical trial matching through Tempus AI's Trials product could empower patients to take a more proactive role in their care.** By connecting patients with suitable clinical trials, Tempus AI provides opportunities for individuals to access cutting-edge treatments and contribute to medical research. This could enhance patient agency by expanding their treatment options.\n\n\u00a0\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Tempus AI's efforts to increase payer coverage and reimbursement for genomic testing could improve access to these potentially empowering tools.** The company acknowledges the financial barriers associated with genomic testing and actively works to improve reimbursement rates and coverage policies. Greater affordability and access to these tests could empower more patients and physicians to make data-driven decisions about care.\n\n\u00a0\n\n# Discussion\n\nTempus AI has built a **\"walled garden\" of patient data** through its Genomics product line. This extensive, de-identified database is a key asset that provides the company with a significant competitive advantage, or \"moat,\" in the healthcare data market.\n\nHere's how this data exclusivity contributes to Tempus AI's moat:\n\n**Data Acquisition:** Tempus AI primarily obtains patient data through its Genomics product line, where it performs next-generation sequencing (NGS) diagnostics and other molecular pathology testing for healthcare providers, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies This direct involvement in the testing process allows the company to capture valuable patient data at its source.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Data Structuring and De-identification:** Tempus AI has developed a proprietary technology platform and operating system, referred to as its Platform, which structures and de-identifies the data collected through its Genomics product line1.... This process ensures the data is usable for research and commercialization while complying with privacy regulations.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Data Commercialization:** The de-identified database is then commercialized through Tempus AI's Data and Services product line, specifically its Insights and Trials products. Insights involves licensing de-identified datasets to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for drug discovery and development6.... Trials focuses on matching patients to clinical trials based on their genomic and clinical data7.\n\n**Limited Data Sharing:** Tempus AI's data licensing agreements typically grant limited, non-exclusive licenses to its customers, restricting their ability to share the data with other parties8.... This controlled access to the data helps to preserve its value and exclusivity.\n\nThe **limited access to Tempus AI's data by other AI companies creates a significant barrier to entry in the market**. Competitors would need to replicate the company's extensive data collection and structuring efforts to develop comparable products.\n\nTempus AI also recognizes the importance of **continuously expanding its database** to maintain its competitive edge2.... The company actively works to:\n\n**Acquire New Customers:** Tempus AI's sales force focuses on building relationships with physicians and hospital systems to promote the adoption of its Genomics testing services10.\n\n**Expand Partnerships:** The company seeks to expand collaborations with existing customers to increase data flow and access to more diverse patient populations10....\n\n**Explore New Disease Areas:** Tempus AI is actively expanding its business beyond oncology into other disease areas, such as neuropsychiatry and cardiology12.... This expansion will further enhance the diversity and value of its database.\n\nHowever, Tempus AI also acknowledges **potential challenges** to its data-driven business model\n\n**Data Access and Privacy:** The company's reliance on healthcare providers and other third parties to obtain patient data in a compliant manner poses a risk. Failures in data privacy compliance could affect Tempus AI's ability to use and commercialize the data.\n\n**Competition for Data Sources:** Tempus AI faces competition from other companies and research institutions for access to valuable patient data.\n\n**Evolving Regulations:** The regulatory landscape surrounding patient data privacy is constantly changing, potentially impacting the company's ability to collect, use, and share data.\n\nOverall, Tempus AI's walled-garden approach to patient data provides the company with a substantial competitive advantage in the healthcare data market. However, the company must navigate the complexities of data access, privacy, and evolving regulations to maintain its data moat and continue its growth trajectory.\n\n# Investment Powerhouses Buy Into TEM\n\n# Softbank and Larry Ellison Involvement with Health Agentic\n\n\u00a0\n\nLarry Ellison has describes how he foresees part of the 500B in AI infrastructure being built being used for health Agentic.\n\n[https://youtu.be/E3HS\\_LwNKps?si=8gTYs\\_82bxcBf9Bh&t=256](https://youtu.be/E3HS_LwNKps?si=8gTYs_82bxcBf9Bh&t=256)\n\nThis vision closely aligns with Tempus AI business model.\u00a0 Moreover, Softbank CEO, is also an investor in Tempus.\n\n[https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20240627](https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20240627)\n\n\u00a0\n\n# Nancy Pelosi and Her Husband\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qwkj871ryfee1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=a223d80ee23eed49fffa93d05c96b7bfbe5d27f0\n\nAs you can see, people with close ties to the President and the President\u2019s vision for AI in America have deep interests in Tempus AI\n\n# Growth\n\nTempus AI has shown significant growth year over year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ebp36xasyfee1.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=33b29c296eba72ec39c9373de1361f02af98d7c3\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTempus AI presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its unique position at the intersection of two high-growth sectors: **healthcare and artificial intelligence**.

        "title": "Primer on Monetary Mechanics",
        "selftext": "Understanding the mechanics of monetary systems is critical for trading, as it directly impacts market liquidity, interest rates, and asset prices. Successful trading strategies often hinge on anticipating how central banks like the Federal Reserve (Fed) manage money supply and credit. The Fed\u2019s operations ripple through financial markets, influencing everything from bond yields and equity valuations to currency movements and funding costs. Traders who grasp these dynamics can better position themselves to profit from shifts in monetary policy and liquidity conditions. To build this foundation, we\u2019ll explore the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, its tools, and their far-reaching effects on the economy and markets.\n\n# 1. The Federal Reserve Balance Sheet\n\nThe Fed\u2019s balance sheet consists of assets and liabilities, which interact to shape liquidity and monetary conditions in the economy:\n\n# Assets\n\n1. **U.S. Treasuries**:\n   * Treasury securities (bills, notes, and bonds) are the largest asset class on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. They represent loans to the federal government and are considered virtually risk-free.\n   * The Fed purchases Treasuries during open market operations to inject liquidity into the financial system. These purchases lower yields, reducing borrowing costs across the economy and encouraging investment.\n   * Conversely, selling Treasuries reduces liquidity and raises yields, acting as a tightening measure.\n2. **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)**:\n   * Acquired during quantitative easing (QE) programs, MBS purchases aim to stabilize the housing market by lowering mortgage rates.\n   * The Fed\u2019s involvement in the MBS market creates demand, which supports liquidity for banks and other institutions issuing these securities.\n3. **Loans to Financial Institutions**:\n   * Includes discount window loans and emergency lending facilities. These loans provide short-term funding to banks facing liquidity crises, ensuring stability in the financial system.\n   * During financial crises, such as in 2008 or 2020, these facilities act as a critical backstop to prevent systemic collapse.\n4. **Other Assets**:\n   * This category includes foreign currency reserves, gold certificates, and various liquidity facilities established during times of stress, such as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).\n\n# Liabilities\n\n1. **Reserve Balances**:\n   * Reserves are deposits held by commercial banks at the Fed. These reserves play a central role in monetary policy as they determine the amount of liquidity in the banking system.\n   * Excess reserves, beyond what banks are required to hold, can be lent out, influencing credit creation and economic activity.\n2. **Currency in Circulation**:\n   * Physical cash held by the public and financial institutions. This is the most visible component of the money supply but represents only a fraction of total liquidity.\n3. **Treasury General Account (TGA)**:\n   * The U.S. Treasury\u2019s account at the Fed. It acts as the government\u2019s checking account, with inflows from tax revenues and debt issuance and outflows for spending programs.\n   * Changes in the TGA have a direct impact on reserves in the banking system, affecting liquidity.\n   * **TGA Interactions with Reserves**:\n      * When the Treasury spends (TGA drawdown), funds flow into the banking system, increasing bank reserves and liquidity. For example, payments for infrastructure projects deposit money into contractor accounts at commercial banks, raising reserve balances.\n      * Conversely, when the Treasury issues debt and deposits proceeds into the TGA (TGA build-up), reserves are drained from the banking system as banks and other institutions purchase Treasury securities, reducing liquidity. This process effectively tightens financial conditions.\n      * Large swings in the TGA balance can create volatility in reserve levels, forcing the Fed to adjust its operations to maintain stability in short-term funding markets.\n4. **Reverse Repo Facility (RRP)**:\n   * A mechanism allowing money market funds and other participants to lend cash to the Fed overnight. This temporarily reduces liquidity in the system while providing a risk-free return to lenders.\n   * **RRP Interactions with Reserves**:\n      * Funds parked in the RRP are removed from the banking system\u2019s reserves temporarily, reducing the overall liquidity available for lending and investment. This can help the Fed manage excess reserves during periods of abundant liquidity.\n      * When funds flow out of the RRP (e.g., as MMFs chase higher yields in T-bills), reserves increase, adding liquidity back into the system. This interplay directly influences the velocity of money and the availability of credit.\n\n# 2. Key Monetary Tools and Their Mechanics\n\n# 1. Open Market Operations (OMO)\n\n* The Fed\u2019s primary tool for managing liquidity involves buying or selling government securities in the open market.\n* **Buying Assets**: When the Fed buys Treasuries or MBS, it credits reserves to the selling bank\u2019s account. This increases system-wide reserves and lowers interest rates by increasing the demand for these assets.\n* **Selling Assets**: When the Fed sells securities, it reduces reserves in the banking system, raising interest rates and tightening monetary conditions.\n\n# 2. Quantitative Easing (QE) and Quantitative Tightening (QT)\n\n* **QE**: Large-scale asset purchases by the Fed to inject liquidity into the economy. By lowering long-term interest rates, QE encourages borrowing, investment, and risk-taking.\n* **QT**: The reverse of QE, where the Fed reduces its balance sheet by allowing securities to mature or actively selling them. This drains reserves and tightens financial conditions, slowing economic activity.\n\n# 3. Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB)\n\n* The Fed pays interest on reserves held by banks. By adjusting the IORB rate, the Fed influences banks\u2019 incentives to lend or hold reserves:\n   * **Higher IORB**: Encourages banks to hold reserves, reducing credit creation.\n   * **Lower IORB**: Promotes lending, increasing money supply and economic activity.\n\n# 4. Discount Window Lending\n\n* The Fed\u2019s discount window provides emergency funding to banks facing short-term liquidity shortages. While rarely used under normal conditions, it\u2019s a vital safety net during crises.\n* The availability of this facility enhances market confidence, ensuring that temporary liquidity issues don\u2019t escalate into broader financial instability.\n\n# 5. Reverse Repo Facility (RRP)\n\n* The RRP provides a floor for short-term interest rates by offering a risk-free return for cash parked at the Fed. This tool helps the Fed maintain control over its policy rate, particularly in times of excess liquidity.\n* **Detailed RRP Mechanics**:\n   * The RRP operates by allowing money market funds, government-sponsored enterprises, and other eligible participants to invest cash with the Fed overnight. In return, participants receive a fixed interest rate.\n   * Funds placed in the RRP are effectively removed from the banking system\u2019s reserves, reducing liquidity and high-velocity money in the economy. This dampens inflationary pressures and helps stabilize short-term interest rates.\n* **Impact of RRP Depletion**:\n   * If the RRP were emptied, participants would redirect funds into other short-term instruments like T-bills or commercial paper. This would inject liquidity back into the system, increasing bank reserves and amplifying the velocity of money.\n   * Without the RRP as a buffer, the Fed would face greater challenges in controlling short-term interest rates during periods of excess liquidity. This could lead to heightened volatility in money markets and complicate monetary policy execution.\n\n# 3. The Mechanics of Liquidity\n\n# Monetary Base vs. Money Supply\n\n* **Monetary Base (M0)**: The sum of currency in circulation and reserves held at the Fed. This forms the foundation of the money supply.\n* **Money Supply (M1, M2)**: Includes currency, demand deposits, and broader money aggregates. These reflect the multiplier effect of bank lending and public spending.\n\n# Liquidity Creation\n\n* The Fed injects reserves into the system through asset purchases or lending. Banks, in turn, use these reserves to create loans, expanding the money supply.\n* The extent of liquidity creation depends on demand for credit, regulatory constraints, and economic conditions.\n\n# Liquidity Drains\n\n* Tools like QT, RRP, and TGA operations remove liquidity by reducing reserves or diverting funds into low-velocity accounts, tightening financial conditions.\n* **Velocity of Money**:\n   * Velocity measures how quickly money circulates in the economy. High velocity indicates active economic participation and rapid money turnover, often accompanying inflationary pressures.\n   * Tools like the RRP and TGA effectively lower velocity by locking up funds in low-velocity accounts. Conversely, liquidity injections increase velocity by providing funds for spending and investment.\n\n# 4. The Treasury General Account (TGA)\n\nThe TGA functions as the government\u2019s primary account, influencing liquidity in the financial system:\n\n* **TGA Drawdowns**: When the Treasury spends, funds flow from the TGA into the banking system. This increases bank reserves, enhancing liquidity and economic activity.\n   * For example, when the Treasury pays contractors or distributes social security benefits, the receiving entities deposit the funds in their commercial bank accounts. These deposits simultaneously increase reserve balances at the Fed.\n* **TGA Build-ups**: Conversely, when the Treasury issues debt and deposits proceeds into the TGA, reserves are drained from the banking system.\n   * The draining effect reduces the liquidity available for banks to lend and invest, tightening financial conditions. This interaction is particularly impactful during periods of large-scale government borrowing.\n* **TGA and RRP Interactions**:\n   * A TGA build-up often coincides with increased RRP usage, as excess liquidity flows from banks into the RRP to earn interest while being temporarily idle. This dynamic reduces the reserves available in the banking system, amplifying the liquidity drain effect.\n   * Conversely, TGA drawdowns can reduce reliance on the RRP by injecting liquidity directly into the economy, increasing reserves and the velocity of money.\n\n# 5. Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) and Money Market Dynamics\n\n# The Role of the RRP\n\n* The RRP acts as a liquidity management tool, attracting excess cash from money market participants during periods of high liquidity.\n* By setting the RRP rate, the Fed influences short-term market rates, steering liquidity toward desired levels.\n\n# Interaction with T-Bills\n\n* Money market funds (MMFs) allocate funds between the RRP and T-bills based on relative yields. When T-bill yields exceed the RRP rate, MMFs shift funds to T-bills, increasing their demand.\n* This dynamic affects liquidity distribution across financial markets, influencing short-term funding costs.\n* **Market Impact of RRP Usage**:\n   * High RRP usage reflects excess liquidity and a lack of attractive investment alternatives. It signals that market participants prefer the safety and yield of the RRP over riskier assets.\n   * Low RRP usage, or a complete depletion, suggests increased risk appetite or higher yields in alternative markets, which can signal tighter monetary conditions or shifting liquidity dynamics.\n\n# 6. Interactions with the Real Economy\n\n# Credit Creation and Multiplier Effect\n\n* Reserves provide the foundation for banks to lend. The actual expansion of credit depends on:\n   * **Borrower Demand**: Businesses and households must seek credit for productive activities.\n   * **Bank Health**: Capital adequacy and balance sheet constraints determine lending capacity.\n\n# Impact on Asset Prices\n\n* Abundant liquidity supports higher valuations for equities, real estate, and other risk assets by lowering discount rates and encouraging risk-taking.\n* Liquidity contractions can trigger market corrections, as higher rates and tighter conditions reduce investment.\n\n# Interest Rates and Borrowing Costs\n\n* The Fed\u2019s policies shape short-term interest rates directly and influence long-term borrowing costs through market expectations, affecting consumption and investment decisions.\n\n# 7. Balancing Act: Managing Reserves, RRP, and TGA\n\nThe Fed\u2019s challenge lies in balancing reserve levels, RRP usage, and TGA fluctuations to achieve desired monetary conditions:\n\n* **Excess Reserves**: Ensure smooth functioning of payment systems and interbank markets, preventing liquidity shortages.\n* **RRP and TGA Dynamics**: Modulate short-term liquidity without destabilizing funding markets or creating undue volatility.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe Fed\u2019s monetary mechanics operate like a finely tuned machine, with its balance sheet acting as the engine and its tools as levers. By understanding these interactions, one can appreciate how central bank policies ripple through the financial system, shaping liquidity, credit, and economic outcomes. While the mechanics are intricate, their influence is far-reaching, underscoring the pivotal role of monetary policy in modern economies.",

        "title": "Tarrifs are a reaction not the cause - Americas silent depression",
        "selftext": "I want to start this out by saying this is not an endorsement of the current Trump administration and trade policy but instead an explanation of why he is doing what he is doing, why what he says or tweets or what headline your read doesn\u2019t matter, and why this will likely continue regardless of what party holds the White House.\n\nAmerica, has been in a silent depression for well over 50 years and has only accelerated in the last 20 years post the Great Financial Crisis and subsequent QE from the Federal reserve. I want to share how the financialization and de-industrialization of America has hollowed out the middle class creating the largest wealth gap in U.S. history, through currency debasement and the exploitation of the global reserve currency status to benefit from cheap labor in developing countries and how that is now coming to an end. \n\nUS AVERAGE HOURLY WAGE / GOLD\n\nGold is the best way to look at purchasing power as it\u2019s the only constant in our current fiat currency system because the supply is finite and it\u2019s value proposition never changes. Gold has been and always will be a shiny yellow rock. Now, if we look at how many shiny rocks you can buy by working for 1 hour, that number has been completely eroded since 1971, and again since China was introduced into the WTO in 2001 and we began to really amplify the globalization of trade and rely on cheap labor from developing countries. 55% of Americans work an hourly wage, consistently losing purchasing power over the last five decades. I think adding the timestamps gives important context to this chart.\n\nSPX/GOLD\n\nNow that we established gold as our base measurement of purchasing power if we look at how the SP500 has performed relative to gold you can see we are well off the highs from the .com bubble. The index has only grown if you look at it against a depreciating currency but in terms of purchasing power we have not actually ever recovered.\n\nTHE DEBT BURDEN\n\nThe last 2 images show the debt burden on the US, which has grown to become the biggest problem we have financially as a country. Debt to gdp has reached levels we haven\u2019t seen since world war 2 but we are financing that debt at much, much higher costs while government revenues to pay that debt has struggled to keep up. The current system relies on ever expanding debt and the dollar staying the king currency. As long as we can continue to hold that reserve status and export our inflation and import cheap manufacturing the train keeps on chugging.\n\nTHE CHINA ISSUE\n\nAfter years of offshoring and hollowing out the middle class we have given China an extreme advantage over us and essentially the world with a monopoly on production and manufacturing. China owns 50% of us pharmaceutical ingredients and production, 60-70% of the rare earth mineral production, 77% of the battery supply chain, 50% of manufacturing of electronics including semiconductors, and much more. At this point our reliance on China has become as national security threat. We are desperately trying to avoid this emperor has no clothes situation where we have all this debt but nothing to back it. Americas, and frankly the rest of the world, reliance on cheap labor and globalization has handed over a monopoly on production and manufacturing leaving all developed nations extremely vulnerable and in desperate need to deglobalize and reshore industry. This is a trend that will continue regardless of who is in office because the current path is, and will continue to be, completely unsustainable.\n\nCOVID AND THE END OF FREE MONEY\n\nCovid was the when the veil slipped. The era of free money and infinite QE was over because we had a new issue that we hadn\u2019t had in a very long time, inflation. QE only works if you have low inflation and a way to export that inflation to other countries through trade. When Covid locked down the entire global trade system we no longer had that privilege and we were forced to stomach the results of printing money for the first time in a very long time. We experienced the quickest rate cut and subsequent rate hike in history all with debt levels reaching historic levels. This marked the start of the deleveraging process and the beginning of the loss of faith in our institutions. We were told repeatedly that inflation was transitory and it wasn\u2019t. Then we saw the feds panicked reaction to the reality that inflation was sticky. The bond market revolted and now almost every G7 nation, most notably Japan, has lost control of the long end of the curve or the long dated bond yields. The curtain on QE is closed, the show is over. \n\nTLDR\n\nAmericas reliance on cheap debt, the abuse of the dollar, and the exploitation of cheap labor in developing nations, is ending and all current and future policy will be a scramble to reset this system. The world is not going back to how it used to be. This time is different.",

        "selftext": "The trade war between the United States and China has taken a dramatic turn, with President Donald Trump signing a new executive order imposing tariffs as high as 245% on imports from China.\n\nThis substantial escalation follows a series of retaliatory measures from both sides, and signals worsening diplomatic and economic tensions between the two global powers.\n\nAccording to the White House, the primary target of these new tariffs is medical equipment-particularly syringes and needles-due to what the administration describes as an over-reliance on Chinese manufacturing in critical sectors of the US medical supply chain. The administration had earlier flagged concerns about the national security implications of such dependency.\n\nThe move also comes as a direct response to China\u2019s latest retaliatory actions, which include:\n\n- Suspension of rare earth exports to the United States.\n- Halting imports of US-manufactured chips, potentially affecting major semiconductor players.\n- Alleged failure to curb fentanyl production and export, which US authorities claim is fueling illegal drug distribution within its borders.\n \nThese developments mark a sharp escalation from earlier tariff rounds, which peaked at 145%. The fresh hike to 245% not only intensifies the cost burden on businesses and consumers but also risks further supply chain disruptions, especially in high-tech and healthcare sectors.\n\nThe announcement has already rattled global markets, with analysts warning of far-reaching impacts on international trade flows, inflation, and the broader geopolitical landscape. With no signs of de-escalation, the US-China trade dispute appears to be entering a more aggressive and unpredictable phase.\n\n",

The logistics companies or freight forwarders collect those tariff fees from sellers in China in advance.\n\nThe de minimis exemption allowed items valued at up to $800 and sent from China via postal service to previously enter the United States duty free and with minimal inspections.\n\nIn February, President Donald Trump ended the de minimis exemption by imposing a tax of 120% of the package's value or a planned flat fee of $200 - set to come into effect by June - blaming it for being heavily used by companies such as Shein, Temu and other e-commerce firms as well as traffickers of fentanyl and other illicit goods.\n\nThe number of shipments entering the U.S. through the tax-free channel exploded in recent years with more than 90% of all packages coming via de minimis. Of those, about 60% came from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.\n\nAccording to 2024 congressional testimony from a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, the average value of a de minimis shipment during fiscal year 2023 was just $54.\n\nChinese online retailers Shein - which is considering a London stock market listing - PDD Holdings-owned Temu and U.S. rival Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn Monday's order, the White House said the reduced tariffs will take effect by 12:01 a.m. (0401 GMT) on May 14, 2025.\n\nThe plan for a $200 flat fee duty rate would also be shelved, it said, keeping it at $100.\n\nChina exported $240 billion in direct-to-consumer goods benefiting from de minimis worldwide last year, accounting for 7% of its overseas sales and contributing 1.3% of gross domestic product, according to Nomura estimates.\n\nJianlong Hu, CEO of Brands Factory, a Chinese cross-border e-commerce consultancy, said 54% was still very high.\n\n\"Sellers are probably taking a wait-and-see approach but in general I think it's fair to say the boom times of small package delivery from China to the U.S., the Golden Age is already gone.\"\n\nShein is more exposed to de minimis changes due to its reliance on speed of getting thousands of new styles each week to consumers in the West by air than others such as Temu.\n\nShein might still be one player that would want to air freight some packages from China and pay the 54% tariffs rather than import all by boat, said Hu.\n\n\"If people are buying clothes on Shein and are told the product will arrive one month later, who will buy that?\"\n\nLOOPHOLE\n\nChina's yuan jumped to a six-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, joining a global rally in riskier assets following the broader trade deal between Beijing and Washington.\n\nTrump's global trade war, which shredded the playbooks that have governed international trade for decades, has shaken up financial markets and raised fears of a recession.\n\nThe U.S. de minimis rule, which dates back to 1938, has been the target of growing criticism from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers.\n\nSome have derided it as a loophole that allows cheap Chinese products to flood into the United States and undercut American industries, while also serving as cover for smuggling contraband such as illegal drugs and their precursor chemicals.\n\nDe minimis, a legal term referring to matters of little importance which describes the U.S. waiver of standard customs procedures and tariffs, was one of the most generous exemptions in the world: the EU de minimis threshold, for example, is 150 euros ($156).\n\nThe Geneva agreement slashed tariffs for both the United States and China by 115 percentage points each, to 10% and 30%, respectively, for at least 90 days.\n\nBREATHING ROOM\n\nThe tariff pause will give online retailers like Shein and Temu breathing space to adapt their businesses, say industry experts, as online retailers are likely to use the time to bring in bulk shipments and restock their U.S. warehouses.\n\nBig beneficiaries of de minimis include online retailers that ship goods mainly from China, such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba's AliExpress. Their growth prompted Amazon to start its own discount service, Haul, allowing marketplace merchants to ship $5 accessories and other items directly from China using de minimis.\n\n\"I think companies that were part of the cross-border boom from China will still want to diversify their business away from the U.S. as much as they can. Everyone has already realised if you depend on the US, it's too risky,\" said Hu of Brands Factory.\n\nSeparately, China has removed a ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing planes in the wake of the Geneva trade deal, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nOfficials in Beijing have started to tell domestic carriers and government agencies this week that deliveries of aircraft made in the United States can resume, Bloomberg said.",

Last week, China signalled that its own across-the-board rates would not rise further.\n\n\"The United States has abused tariffs on all trading partners under the banner of so-called 'equivalence', while also forcing all parties to start so-called 'reciprocal tariffs' negotiations with them,\" the ministry spokesperson said.\n\nChina is determined and capable of safeguarding its own rights and interests, and is willing to strengthen solidarity with all parties, the ministry said.\n\n\"The fact is, nobody wants to pick a side,\" said Bo Zhengyuan, partner at China-based policy consultancy Plenum.\n\n\"If countries have high reliance on China in terms of investment, industrial infrastructure, technology know-how and consumption, I don't think they'll be buying into U.S. demands. Many Southeast Asian countries belong to this category.\"\n\nPursuing a hardline stance, Beijing will this week convene an informal United Nations Security Council meeting to accuse Washington of bullying and \"casting a shadow over the global efforts for peace and development\" by weaponizing tariffs.\n\nEarlier this month, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said nearly 50 countries have approached him to discuss the steep additional tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.",

Xi noted policy support would be provided in areas such as government procurement, intellectual property rights, research and cultivating talent.\n\nSome experts say China has narrowed the AI development gap with the United States over the past year. The Chinese AI startup DeepSeek drew global attention when it launched an AI reasoning model in January that it said was trained with less advanced chips and was cheaper to develop than its Western rivals. China has also made inroads in infrastructure software engineering.\n\nThe DeepSeek announcement challenged the assumption that U.S. sanctions were holding back China's AI sector amid a fierce geopolitical tech rivalry, and that China lagged the U.S. after the breakthrough launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\n\"We must continue to strengthen basic research, concentrate our efforts on mastering core technologies such as high-end chips and basic software, and build an independent, controllable, and collaborative artificial intelligence basic software and hardware system,\" Xi said.\n\nHe added that AI regulations and laws should be speeded up to build a \"risk warning and emergency response system, to ensure that artificial intelligence is safe, reliable, and controllable.\"\n\nXi said last year that AI shouldn't be a \"game of rich countries and the wealthy,\" while calling for more international governance and cooperation on AI.",

The companies individually operate pharmacy benefit managers Caremark, Optum Rx and Express Scripts.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers have already been under regulatory pressure from the Federal Trade Commission, which had sued them under the Biden administration over their insulin pricing practices.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry has blamed them for high prices, saying the aftermarket discounts and fees add hidden costs to drug prices.\n\nJeff Jonas, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said the executive order would keep that negative pressure on companies like Cigna, CVS, and UnitedHealth.\n\n\"The system of high list prices and big, hidden rebates makes the system very opaque and hard to navigate,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for CVS said the company welcomed the president\u2019s focus on pricing by pharmaceutical companies and aimed to have discussions with the administration on making pricing more affordable.\n\nHe said that its negotiations with drugmakers in health plans it operates for Medicare prescription drug insurance had resulted in \"significantly lower\" costs than that which the government had been able to extract in the 7 of ten drugs it has directly negotiated under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nCigna and UnitedHealth did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nIndustry spokesman Greg Lopes, vice president of public affairs at the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, said the problem was with the drugmakers and that PBMs were the only check against drug companies\u2019 unlimited pricing power.\n\nAmerican reliance on employer-sponsored health plans poses a challenge to the implementation and may require congressional oversight to enforce, one analyst said.\n\nBecause pharmacy benefit managers provide bundled services to clients, companies could raise the costs of other services or administrative fees, effectively maintaining the same plan pricing, said Julie Utterback, an analyst at Morningstar.\n\nShe said UnitedHealth shares had not fallen as much because the company is more diversified than Cigna and CVS, which also has a retail pharmacy that could be negatively impacted by lower drug prices.",

        "title": "Why I Believe the Bull Market for Uranium is Just Getting Started",
        "selftext": "Since 2020, the price of uranium has gone from $21/lb to a high of $106/lb in Feb 2024. The price has experienced a slight pull back since then to $83/lb. I believe this 4-5x change in the price of uranium to be small compared to what lies ahead, and I will explain the reasons why in this paper.\u00a0\n\n**What is Uranium?**\n\nUranium is an abundant, radioactive metal naturally occurring in earth's crust. The vast purpose of it today is used for creating nuclear fuel to provide energy. It is one of the cleanest burning fuels and very easy on the environment. Think of Uranium as a gas pump, there are different options you can choose between based on grade. We will focus on the two main isotopes for Uranium. When it is mined, approximately 99.3% is uranium-238 and 0.7% is uranium-235.\n\nU-238 is a critical component of plutonium production which in itself gives a TON of demand. The major application of Uranium in the military sector is depleted Uranium (DU). DU is mostly U-238 after U-235 has been removed. It is used to create armor piercing rounds and military projectiles. The high density of DU makes weapons highly effective. There are other important uses of U-238, such as counterbalancing aircraft, though we are not focusing on those.\n\nU-235 is even more important because for the most part, this is what fuels the reactors. In order to power a nuclear reactor, the concentration of U-235 needs to be 3-5% instead of 0.7%. The higher concentration makes it fissionable, meaning it can power light-water reactors which are the most common reactor design in the USA (United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission). One kilogram (2.2 LBS) of U-235 produces as much energy as 3,306,930 pounds of coal.\n\n**HALEU**\n\nHigh-assay low-enriched uranium. A crucial material needed to deploy advanced nuclear reactors. Currently, HALEU is not commercially available from US based suppliers. Boosting domestic supply could spur the development of advanced reactors in the US (Energy.gov). In November, the DOE reached a key milestone under its HALEU demonstration project, when a company produced the nation\u2019s first 20 kilograms of HALEU. Thus, providing a first of its kind production in the United States in more than 70 years. Amid growing efforts to secure a reliable domestic nuclear fuel supply, the DOE has awarded contracts to six companies as part of an $800 million initiative to bolster the deconversion of high-assay low-enriched uranium (Roan, 2024).\n\nThe existing fleet of US reactors run on enriched uranium up to 5% with U-235. However, most advanced reactors require HALEU which is enriched between 5% to 20% in order to achieve smaller and more versatile designs with the highest standards of safety, security and nonproliferation. HALEU also allows developers to optimize their systems for longer life cores, increased efficiencies, and better fuel utilization. Together, the US, Canada, France, Japan and the UK have announced collective plans to mobilize $4.2 billion in government-led spending to develop safe and secure nuclear energy supply chains (Energy.gov).\u00a0\n\nAs we now know, enriched uranium is crucial. Although, the enrichment process is very costly. Russia is the biggest player in the enrichment process. They are responsible for roughly 44% of the world\u2019s enrichment capacity and supply approximately 35% of imported nuclear fuel to the US. As of August 12th, 2024, Uranium imports into the USA from Russia are outlawed. This allows $2.7 billion in funding to build out the U.S uranium industry specifically, to increase production of LEU and HALEU. The DOE estimates that US utilities have roughly 3 years of LEU available through existing inventory or pre-existing contracts. To ensure no plants are disrupted, a waiver process is in order to allow some imports of LEU from Russia to continue for a limited time. \u201cIn the meantime, we\u2019re taking aggressive steps to establish a secure and reliable uranium supply market\u201d (Energy.gov).\u00a0\n\n**Uranium Supply**\n\nNow, the supply that was once held of uranium is running out. \u201cThe inventory overhang that was so damaging to the market for almost a decade has been largely consumed, and going forward, we\u2019re going to have an increasing reliance on primary supply\u201d (World Nuclear News). Idled mines are now starting production again, as well as increases in mines under development, and planned mines. \u201cThere is no doubt that sufficient uranium resources exist to meet future needs, but producers have been waiting for the market to rebalance before starting to invest in new capacity and bring idled capacity back into operation. This is now happening (World Nuclear News).\n\nThe uranium market has been facing a supply deficit for years due to underinvestment. The problem is that uranium mines take a long time and require a ton of capital to get up and running. A mine can take 10-15 years to begin production AFTER they are opened.\u00a0\n\nAs with other minerals, investment in geological exploration generally results in increased known resources. Over 2005 and 2006, exploration efforts resulted in the world\u2019s known uranium resources increasing by 15% (World Nuclear Association). Therefore, there is no need to anticipate any uranium shortage. The world\u2019s current measured resources of uranium will last about 90 years. This represents a higher level of assured resources than is normal for most minerals. There is nearly limitless supply because most of it has not been discovered due to little investment in mining and exploration.\u00a0\n\nPrimary Supply - This type of supply refers to uranium extracted directly from mining. The primary supply has been under heavy pressure in recent years due to low uranium prices. Low prices lead to reduced mining operations. This is because mining is incredibly expensive, and companies won\u2019t do it if there is no good price incentive at which they could sell the uranium. It is forecasted that uranium mining will not meet the reactor demands for at least 15 years. Now, it is also estimated that by 2035, primary uranium production will decrease by 30% due to resource depletion and mine closures. New mines will only be able to compensate for the capacity of the exhausted mines.\n\nSecondary Supply - This refers to all uranium that is not sourced directly from mining but from other inventories and recycled materials. This includes civil stockpiles, military stockpiles, recycled uranium and enrichment tails. Civil stockpiles (uranium reserves held by utilities, hedge funds, and government) grew immensely after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Many reactors shut down due to the worries surrounding uranium, and investment in the nuclear sector decreased. Due to this, there was a large oversupply of uranium. Since then, these stockpiles have been largely drawn upon to meet reactor demand, instead of relying on primary supply. So, utilities have been relying on their inventory to fuel their reactors, instead of getting fresh uranium from mines. This has caused a gradual depletion of their reserves. There is no mathematical way to rely on reserves anymore. The ONLY option is to produce uranium in order to keep reactors operational while meeting future demand.\n\n**Uranium Demand**\u00a0\n\nThe United States, China, and France represent around 58% of global uranium demand. Uranium demand can be characterized as a predictable function of the number of operating nuclear power plants, their capacity factors and fuel burn up levels. As of April 30th, 2024, there are 94 operating nuclear reactors in the United States. The global count of operating nuclear reactors is 440. These account for 9% of the world's electricity. Currently, there are 60 nuclear reactors in production across 16 countries spanning into 2030. About 90 more reactors have been planned and over 300 have been proposed.\u00a0\n\nLooking ten years ahead, the uranium market is expected to grow. The 2023 World Nuclear Association\u2019s Nuclear Fuel Report shows a 28% increase in uranium demand over 2023-2030. This same report predicts a 51% increase in uranium demand for the decade 2031-2040. Global demand for electricity may rise 165% by 2050 while at the same time, 101 countries have committed to net-zero carbon emission goals and are actively pursuing a shift to clean energy.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0m5mnb7ginud1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc0347c0edc9d5b394247c4edf75580911dcafe6\n\n**Global Price of Uranium Last 25 Years (USD/Lbs)**\n\n**Uranium Production**\n\nThe main producers of uranium are Kazakhstan, Canada, Namibia, Australia, and Uzbekistan. Kazakhstan is the major producer. In 2022, they produced 43% of the world\u2019s uranium. The company Kazatomprom is responsible for the massive production within the country. Very big news came out recently stating they have slashed their production target for 2025 by 17%. This is due to project delays and sulfuric acid shortages (a critical component of uranium extraction). They are expected to produce 25,000-26,500 tons of yellowcake (a concentrated form of uranium ore produced during the early stage of processing). This move is likely to continue the upward pressure on uranium prices. This slash in production is occurring while Kazatomprom has their lowest reported uranium inventory levels since 1997 of 4,142 tonnes of uranium, down 31% from the previous year (Dempsey, 2024). \u201cThis is a structural problem. It won\u2019t just be the west saying this is an issue for us; it will also be Russia and China saying it\u2019s a problem for our new nuclear power plants\u201d (Nick Lawson, CEO of Ocean Wall).\u00a0\n\nUranium prices have been low for decades due to oversupply and stockpiles. This has made it less appealing to develop new mines and instead, rely on existing mines and supply. However, the US and other countries are showing increased signs of uranium mining at an alarming rate. In the first quarter of 2024, the United States produced more than 82,000 LBS of uranium which is more than the entire 2023 production. In Q2 of 2024, production increased to 97,709 LBS, an 18% increase from Q1 2024.\u00a0\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fawhp07iinud1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=aff66ec49620b41f9a41659b4840b98b1dbc894e\n\n**United States Uranium Production 2000-2024 Q2 lbs**\n\nIn a recent interview with Justin Huhn, a uranium market expert, he stated \u201cYTD there has been 54 million pounds contracted. Demand pulled back temporarily and when that happened, price kept rising. It's a hugely important indicator that when demand comes back in, which it is starting to, the prices are going higher. We're starting to see early signs of that. Honestly, I think we are on the cusp of a very large movement in the coming weeks. We're going to see a competitive environment for limited supply. That's what is coming next. The ceiling in the contracts tells you where the price is going. The 3 and 5 year forward tells you where the spot is going. Every piece of evidence in the physical market is telling us that prices are going higher.\"\n\n\"Companies need uranium and they aren't going to not buy it at price xyz. Now, could we get to a point where logically the price of uranium utility does not justify continued operations? That's possible. And unless we have a balanced market, that might be the limiting upside factor. Price would have to be somewhere in the $700s for the average utility to not afford to buy that uranium in order to operate their facilities.\u201d\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fg1ex5ojinud1.png?width=1130&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e51627b5a9c2352171215ffc997124e0cd9905e\n\n**World Uranium Production vs Reactor Requirements, 1945-2022 tU**\n\n# Conclusion\u00a0\n\nThe bull market for uranium is just beginning. There is immense demand, and production simply can\u2019t meet the requirements. Prospective mines can take 10-15 years to become operational, while 30% of current mines are estimated to be depleted by 2035. There is simply not enough time available for the uranium supply to meet the demand. Companies are willing and obligated to secure nuclear fuel at almost any price. Increased investment into nuclear energy is happening. Countries are uniting in the fight against climate change to establish a global supply of clean, zero-carbon energy. Therefore, I believe that as the supply continues to dwindle and demand continues to increase, the fight for uranium that will ensue is going to send the price to levels we have never before seen in history.\u00a0\n\n**Investment Ideas**\n\nI think mining companies are best set up to gain from this market. A high uranium price means they earn higher revenues by selling it. This also allows them to further develop mines and explore new areas, increasing overall production. These mining companies are Cameco (CCJ) currently trading at $50.86 and Denison Mines (DNN) trading at $1.92. I also like the mining ETF Range Nuclear Renaissance Index (NUKZ) trading at $38.31. The other companies I like in this sector are Clean Harbors, Inc. trading at $257.48 and Constellation Energy (CEG) trading at $265.86. Clean Harbors has a dominant position in the market for the handling and disposal of nuclear waste. They also have very good management. I\u2019d say they are my favorite pick out of the entire sector.\u00a0\n\n**Disclaimer**\u00a0\n\n**This is not financial advice.**\n\n**Sources**\u00a0\n\nDempsey, H.

The thing is, in the coming years, these companies are going to be paying a hell of a lot more on average for the uranium they need to supply their reactors. Compare that to the mining companies who are already locking in contracts above their normal value per pound, resulting in increased revenues and greater overall profitability. The producers (miners) have complete control of the market essentially, and buyers (utility companies) are forced to compete for it.\n\nThe mining in the US is not significant in terms of the global supply therefore, increased mining in the US won't really impact the overall market for uranium.  It is important that they are ramping up production from a domestic standpoint, in order to reduce the reliance on foreign imports. The Russia/Ukraine crisis has opened a lot of eyes for the need of our own uranium supply.",

        "selftext": "The Biden administration is nearing completion of allocating $39 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing the U.S. semiconductor industry. However, the real challenges lie ahead.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdf9m7djblid1.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e025771e6fee5aa7b382d717d76d75e28ad992\n\n1.\u00a0 The CHIPS Act, passed two years ago, is a bold attempt to bring advanced chip production back to the U.S., betting on Intel, Micron, TSMC, and Samsung. The goal is to produce 20% of the world's most advanced processors by 2030, up from nearly zero today.\n\n2.\u00a0 Key to this effort is Mike Schmidt, who leads the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) at the U.S. Department of Commerce. His team, composed of experts from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley, aims to reduce reliance on Asia, particularly Taiwan, as chips are essential for everything from microwaves to missiles.\n\n3.\u00a0 The CHIPS Act outlines specific goals and capacity expectations, as shown in the chart. According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ql00qa4mblid1.jpg?width=782&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcfc2ebb6208c46f219d109747a3faec604084a8\n\nThe immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus.\n\n\n\n4.\u00a0 Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington.\n\n5.\u00a0 Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's \"trump card\" in ensuring U.S. protection.\n\n6.\u00a0 The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories.\n\nFor individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.",

Intel isn\u2019t some golden goose that will shine in the darkness \n\n- Both Samsung and TSMC have both gotten tons of money in loans and grants for Fabs. Both of which do better than Intel. They are also building in other places around the world too while Intel has halted things. \n\n- Intel has halted other chip plants around the world. Most that are continuing building are ones where an investment group is buying like a 50% stake in said fabs. Which isn\u2019t good for long term profitability. \n\n- Intel\u2019s 13th gen and 14th gen chips just got an alleged fix to their microcode. **Before this fix chips overtime were degrading and essentially bricking themselves**. People and business **are not happy**. **A lot of trust is gone because they handled this all the wrong way and some business lost millions**. \n\n- Going off of my last point they still need to sell the 13th and 14th gen cpu\u2019s in their inventory. The trust is gone. No one unless Intel sells them for dirt cheap is going to buy them. This is going to have a lot of future consequences. CCG over the next two quarters might not look so good. \n\n- Intel is currently getting their lunch money taken by AMD in Datacenter/AI chips. This isn\u2019t going to change and could get much much worse. Intel currently has margins of 9% here. They are basically giving them away. \n\n- A lot of companies are moving to Amd in Datacenter/Ai . Intel might have agreements and contracts but many of those will expire in the future. \n\n- Intel has debt that\u2019s growing and continues to grow. They have 20 billion of cash on hand and almost 52 billion in debt while the market cap is hovering in the 80-90 billion range. If this falls at all we will see banks calling. \n\n- Intels investments like Mobileye for example have fallen quite a lot. It could have been used for an emergency piggy bank for them. At one point their stake was worth 25 billion now it\u2019s worth 10 ish billion. \n\n- Intel when announcing the job cuts also said they were cutting time off, vacation time people earned and benefits and quality of life things across the board to save money. Their stock is also bricking and shows no momentum. \n\n- Why is the above point important ? **Because Intel already has a talent problem that NOW has exponentially got worse.** What is left of the talent is going to leave, or is getting to get cut in layoffs and new employees are going to be bottom of the barrel. \n\n- Cutting 1/5 of the workforce isn\u2019t a small thing. Do people really think this won\u2019t affect their releases as well as engineering on chips going forward ? \n\n- If Intel loses any support at all in CCG they will be in monster trouble. It\u2019s the only big area of support they still have. The 13th and 14th gen scandal and their lack of leadership handling it is going to be trouble. \n\n- They are probably going to be taken off the Dow shortly in place of Nvidia or AMD. Which will then cause funds to sell their positions. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why anyone would buy Intel right now when their fabs they keep talking about keep getting delayed and probably won\u2019t be working until late 2026 to mid 2027. Especially when in the short term they literally have nothing but negative press coming. Long term maybe it\u2019s a buy but it\u2019s not like they are going to go up for quite a while **if** they see the light at the end of the tunnel.",

Multiple alternative data sources point to worsening financials in Q4 2024 and beyond.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nCarvana is an online used-car retailer that gained rapid traction over the past few years by offering a distinctive, digital-first car-buying experience. However, over the last four years, the company has grappled with a litany of challenges, including ballooning debt, operational missteps, and controversy surrounding its financial disclosures.\n\n[Hindenburg Research's](https://hindenburgresearch.com/carvana/) short report on Carvana alleges significant financial improprieties, including $800 million in loan sales to a suspected undisclosed related party, accounting manipulation, and lax underwriting practices. The report suggests that these actions have temporarily inflated Carvana's reported income, raising concerns about the company's long-term sustainability and transparency.\n\nCarvana has denied this obviously, calling them \"intentionally misleading and inaccurate.\" but hasn't actually said much of substance to refute them. I found Hindenburg's report credible, but I was also concerned by several analysts upgrading their rating for Carvana, so I did my own research.\n\n# The subtle signs that Carvana is not well\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ocmcssu25wde1.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6f199d76d50fa5af19d764787305959a49f0852\n\n# Carvana has been bribing employees to post good employee reviews.\n\nI investigated Carvana\u2019s Glassdoor reviews and how that had changed over time. I discovered a deluge of fake 5 star reviews in May (and likely to a lesser degree in prior months). The spike is so ridiculously large compared to surrounding months, their contents are so obviously self-serving and are entirely from \"current employees\", when for every month since there has been a roughly even balance of current vs former employee reviews. **These reviews are clearly manufactured**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjkkpj245wde1.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=2401060afd0cd619b7fc1c8ff514ce421893ea7d\n\nA Carvana employee that I spoke to told me that employees were encouraged to make Glassdoor reviews due to the wave of negative reviews the company received after their mass layoffs. Furthermore, there is further evidence online of the **company paying employees in-kind** to burnish the company image\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9fmtu4i65wde1.png?width=481&format=png&auto=webp&s=607d9f9c702a0b4341b87cd0a9042c80a91bb198\n\nSo what does this hide? Well it means that its[ Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Reviews/CARVANA-Reviews-E750603.htm) rating of \\~3/5, is probably more like \\~2/5, which is extremely poor, and well below its competitors. Share prices for companies with poor Glassdoor ratings tend to do worse than their competitors. Companies with fake ratings I assume do even worse (albeit maybe not in the short run).\n\nNow the reviews outside the obvious fakes reveal a consistently negative view of the company with rampant nepotism, problematic loan practices, fraud, covert firing practices and poor training (someone went through the most problematic ones [here](https://manvsdebt.com/my-open-letter-to-ernest-garcia/)). I suspect this may have been a motivating source of evidence for the recent Hindenburg report.\n\n**Despicably someone at the company appears to be very proactive in using Glassdoor to deal with PR problems**. On their Glassdoor page there are very few reviews that relate to maternity leave (30 out of 3000 over an 8 year period). However, in September 2024, **three** positive reviews were made about the company's maternity benefits compared with a long term average of 0.3 reviews per month. This includes [one on the ](https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Benefits/CARVANA-Maternity-and-Paternity-Leave-US-BNFT23_E750603_N1.htm?countryRedirect=true)**exact same day** (below) that a lawsuit was filed against Carvana for unlawfully firing a woman for being pregnant. Innocuous at first glance, but statistically **so unlikely** to be a coincidence.\n\n[Who thought going after pregnant women was a good idea?](https://preview.redd.it/mcy6k5395wde1.png?width=423&format=png&auto=webp&s=44d19cb50ef87075f421fe8454487339f5a2556f)\n\n# Carvana employees are illegally posing as neutral third parties online to discourage customers from returning low quality cars.\n\nI can\u2019t post my evidence of this because of Reddit rules (it got my previous account banned). **What I will stress, is that it\u2019s illegal under the FTC act to pose as a neutral third party in a way that results in a financial gain for the company.**\n\n**I have now reported Carvana (and two employees I suspect are behind it) to the FTC.**\n\n# Carvana is manipulating its customer reviews\n\nCarvana's trust pilot rating stands out from its competitors in both numbers of reviews (despite doing much less business than competitors) and its rating. The only company with a similar rating is DriveTime \u2013 (owned by Ernest Garcia II aka Ernest Garcia III's dad).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uwf2s14c5wde1.png?width=280&format=png&auto=webp&s=915443fd5544d8c3aa95524b0d7b235fc958cc08\n\nBoth companies have been flagged by [Trustpilot](https://au.trustpilot.com/review/carvana.com?page=2) for using methods that manipulate positive reviews. However, the reviews are also consistent with very happy sellers (**not a controversial statement**) being overpaid by Carvana, with most reviews flagging virtually non-existent quality assurance.\n\nThe problem is, if you are buying used cars, you need to be rejecting at least some cars, you can't let everyone have a positive experience - it's literally the classic adverse selection problem. You will simply end up holding bad cars (or bad loans if you manage to sell them). In fact, almost all negative reviews come from buying low quality cars.\n\nAnyways, I then scraped the data from Trustpilot. And again, I find clear evidence confirming manipulation. When the company was in dire straights in June 2022 and service quality was deteriorating. The company responded by suggesting trustpilot reviews to those most likely to give it positive reviews (presumably sellers).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vlysq2rd5wde1.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae9551d170e5d1af0760ad2b3ff090bd012e564b\n\n# Ally Financial, Carvana and did Hindenburg get it wrong?\n\nA large part of the Hindenburg short thesis is Carvana's heavy reliance on Ally Financial for purchasing its loan book. They note that other banks have considered partnering with Carvana, which would help them diversify, but have pulled out upon seeing their underwriting practices. For Carvana this poses a massive key business risk because if Ally pulls out, Carvana can't extend car loans. Hindenburg argued that a pull out looked likely as Ally scaled back its 2nd and 3rd quarter purchases and in September 2024, Ally reported an\u00a0unexpected surge\u00a0in delinquencies, with its CFO\u00a0[warning](https://www.bamsec.com/transcripts/f5a760e2-2507-46e6-a628-2af1ddbc441c?hl_id=njr4ed0ewl): \u201con the retail auto side, our credit challenges have intensified\u201d. Furthermore, Hindenburg's report also came with warnings **from Ally executives** themselves that delinquency rates were getting too high.\n\nBut Ally didn't pull out. Only a few days ago, **Ally doubled down**, renewing their deal for another year and increased purchases to $4bn.\n\nSo did Hindenburg get their short thesis wrong? Why would Ally Financial double down on Carvana\u2019s auto loans when they have been **publicly signalling** a move away? Furthermore, why work with a company that they **know is cooking their books**?\n\nTwo reasons. Firstly, Ally may be greedy regards, in which case short Ally. But the more likely reason is that they are bleeding Carvana like a stuffed pig.\n\nAlly are Carvana's **only** ***real*** buyer. They wield immense power over Carvana, and this power has grown as the auto market has soured and other banks have gone on record against Carvana. Ally are clearly aware of the growing risks, and if anything, Hindenburg has given them more negotiating leverage. Looking at their actions with the benefit of hindsight, the 2nd and 3rd quarter loan purchase reductions should not be seen as them wavering. Nor should its public announcements of higher auto loan losses. Instead, they were signalling a credible **threat** that they would walk away if they didn't get a better deal. Remember they're no stranger to dealing - they've already renegotiated 5 times in 2 years and they know that if Carvana didn't get a deal they'd go bust. They played chicken and Carvana blinked.\n\nCan we check the details of the deal? No - they've **redacted** this information from their filings. There's your **big red flag**. This is consistent with Ally being increasingly picky with what loans they are willing to take, expect them to pay less and to be buying loans with better FICO scores.\n\nExpect a good next quarter from Ally, and a negative one from Carvana (if they\u2019re honest\u2026)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pz86cmjg5wde1.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e90da5341be084b772d223ab03554f1ad7de082\n\n# Where next for Carvana?\n\nWell, they're being squeezed on both ends (growing auto losses and worsening deals with Ally). This will cut into margins on lending particularly in Q1 (which make up a large share of their apparent profit). Their response to Ally's bullying in Q2 and Q3 was fraud. Now thanks to their new agreement, we can probably expect them to hold (or hide) even more of their worst performing loans.\n\nAs revealed by Hindenburg, Carvana is being subsidised by his father\u2019s private company Drivetime. Drivetime\u2019s financial details are opaque, however it is known that they posted a loss of $69.3 million year end of 2023. This figure, even if we assume DriveTime\u2019s favourable dealing was costing them **twice this amount** annually, is still a bargain for the Garcia family. At Carvana\u2019s current stock\u2019s valuation, their stake (which they are selling) has grown rapidly to $20billion. So, for a paltry sum to keep the company afloat through favourable transactions, they can sell Carvana stock at crazy valuations. If needed, the proceeds of these sales can then be put back into DriveTime (without people noticing) for far less than what the favourable transactions cost. So, this too is likely to continue until the market wises up.\n\nAnother direction they may take that has not been picked up by short reports, is to get their risk down. Their actions over the past two years have meant they are buying increasingly expensive lemons. This is causing problems in several areas. While they hold the cars, they are making an immediate heavy theoretical loss. When they try to sell the cars, it is costing them time, delivery costs, labour costs, depreciation, and legal costs when those cars are returned within the warranty period. Then even if the car is not returned, because they are selling loans, the collateral on the loan is a worthless. So, if the car fails and the person needs it for work, they will default. Likewise, if the loan fails for other reasons, even if they do repossess the car, it will have little resale value (for loans that they still hold). They\u2019re finally wising up to the fact that as an auto finance provider compared with simply a used car retailer, it is in their interest to be selling at least somewhat usable cars because of this enduring financial relationship.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xb6urdgh5wde1.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=d384231f22d31d6faa5b9c62e8b44ab5a086fb3f\n\nTwo years ago the company went through large layoffs in their [operation division](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/carvana-layoffs-2500-workers-zoom-email/#:~:text=Carvana%2C%20blaming%20a%20%22recession%22,Garcia%20said%20in%20the%20email) to bring down costs. At the time, the Carvana workforce was heavily mismanaged. There was a clear need to do greater diligence on car purchases, as the quality of cars had deteriorated significantly during COVID. However, reports show that many employees spent their days idle, playing video games or not showing up to work.\n\nManagement evidently realised that if they could still sell cars without doing due diligence on them then they lay their employees off. This made it virtually impossible to repair/assess cars all the cars they now bring in, and most work now is cosmetic (if at all). For this leaner model to work, it required that reduced compensation would need to outweigh worsening auto losses (as it leads to more lemons)\n\nHowever, it was clearly **unsustainable** and so in contradiction to his recent vague interview about turning the company around and finding efficiencies, they are just turning back lol. They now have close to a thousand open positions on LinkedIn most of which are in... you guessed it **operations. Reflecting this hasty turnaround**, many of their roles in automotive repair even offer substantial signing bonuses ($5000+).\n\nNow of course these numbers could also be reflective of a company that is expanding to new geographies \u2013 but it\u2019s not. Carvana is currently expanding its facilities in Belton, Atlanta, Portland, Las Vegas, and Oklahoma \u2013 these account for 6, 17, 17, 7, 19 of the jobs listed. So, the remaining 90% of their new hires are in existing locations. \u00a0\n\nSo, they might be set to vet their cars more. But it also means that the whole turnaround story that they've spun over the past 2 years is junk. They haven't found some hidden secret to abnormal profits. They will face higher labour costs and lower margins and all they have to show for it is a costly restructure, fraudulent accounting and a worsening loan book. \u00a0Lastly, they were unprofitable before, how does reverting help?\n\n# Insiders are showing signs of distress.\n\nErnie\u2019s rate of greying has accelerated rapidly from approximately 7% grey hairs to 38% in just three years\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ha21sgtj5wde1.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3fa013ebe2169278105f5dffe185c7322511072\n\nThis greying is remarkable, because his father (who happens to be older than his son lol) still has colour in his hair. In fact, I predict that Ernest III will overtake Ernest II by Q3 2026. Carvana bulls might blame Ernest's mother's genetics for his early greying; however, I think that convicted criminal Ernest II is just simply better able to handle the heat in the kitchen.\n\n# Ira and Georgiana Platt\u2019s lifestyle recession\n\n**Ira has been the Chair of Carvana's Audit Committee** for the past 7 years. According to Hindenburg, \"*Ira has long-standing links to the Garcia family. Platt acted as a banker for DriveTime (then called Ugly Duckling) stretching as far back as 1998, per SEC*\u00a0[*records*](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/106415899000049/6?cik=1012704&hl=104779:104788&hl_id=vyl9gerbbl)*. He is named on*\u00a0[*stock pledge agreements*](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/106415899000062/5?cik=1012704&hl=28942:28966&hl_id=e1bzzlhwbg)*, loan*\u00a0[*agreements*](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/106415899000049/6?cik=1012704&hl=104779:104788&hl_id=vya1merzzl)*, and*\u00a0[*bond placements*](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/106415899000062/2?cik=1012704&hl=1944:1953&hl_id=v1zmxxrwwx)*, among others. He was elected as a Director of DriveTime in*\u00a0[*February 2014*](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/144530514001134/1?cik=1012704&hl=335496:335538&hl_id=eygwmxs-bx)*, serving until 2017,. Platt joined Carvana at the*\u00a0[*time of the IPO*](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/169082024000138/1?cik=1690820&hl=35989:36072&hl_id=4koxsgb-bl)\u00a0*in 2017. A Delaware entity he manages has benefited from*\u00a0[*tax structuring agreement*](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312517156305/7?cik=1690820&hl=62835:62861&hl_id=njerrlhbbe)\u00a0*with Carvana.*[*\\[18\\]*](https://hindenburgresearch.com/carvana/#_ftn18)\"\n\nGood corporate governance would argue that the audit chair should be independent, instead almost his entire net worth consists of Carvana stock (although thankfully, he is rapidly selling stock - nice!).\n\nNow some investors try to infer market information from changes in prominent employees' spending. They should instead look at their family members, particularly wives, who typically organise a much larger share of household spending and who don't face restrictions on social media.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsyusdul5wde1.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f85d9a366d65654743ba93b79a353a1d723a94a\n\nGeorgiana Platt lives a charmed life, she regularly posts to social media, travels frequently, and likes to give back to the community. She has had an unremarkable career as an event planner and Microsoft excel coach. However, she has amassed immense wealth through her astute investments in Georgiana Ventures LLC a \"*Private investment enterprise that structures, aggregates and leads capital investment in innovative enterprises with rapid growth profiles and strong leadership in emerging marketplaces*.\" She even employs her husband Ira as the LLC's sole employee. In reality this is just a vehicle to hold and protect Ira's ill-made millions (see [here ](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312517156305/7?cik=1690820&hl=62835:62861&hl_id=njerrlhbbe)listed as an investor in Carvana's IPO).\n\nI have attempted to estimate Georgiana's spending habits to predict Carvana's share price. Scraping her social media accounts I have determined her travel log over the past 6 years. I used this to generate a travel spending index, where every time she travels interstate I give it one point, and every time she travels internationally I give it two points. To reduce noise I have excluded her regular travel between her three homes (Louisiana, Utah and Connecticut - not a bad life hey). And to smooth it out, I have averaged the index over 3 months.\n\nAs Ira is an insider you would expect that his foreknowledge of business problems, would make Georgiana's spending habits a leading share price indicator. Using her travel index score as a 12 month leading indicator, the index **very closely** matches Carvana's share price movements. The one exception is the first half of the COVID period where travel was heavily restricted (although during this time she made several posts complaining about cancelling trips). **Note**: the shaded part refers to the leading time series dates (not the share price time series) where we would have expected greater travel spending - absent COVID\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/83w5a0mn5wde1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d2aec31f77936d60084011fd46aea91afa672c\n\nLooking at her travel over the last 12 months, we see a massive drop from approximately 4 flights a month, to less than 0.5 (Georgiana Platt has not been on a plane in 2025. I repeat NO FLIGHTS IN 2025!).\n\nUsing a forecasting method known as a ruler, I am predicting a price target of approximately $0 in one year's time.\n\n**Position**\n\nMy position are CVNA Jun2025 $80 puts. 50 contracts\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5uxigcp5wde1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=002eeb81bbcfe9917c60482813e1d00e8fc4bd88\n\n",

        "title": "Microsoft vs nvidia better bet for 10,000$?",
        "selftext": "Microsoft Vs Nvidia better bet for 10,000 $?\n\nHello fellow investors,\n\nI\u2019m currently evaluating a $10,000 investment over the next year and am deliberating between NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT). Given the dynamic nature of the tech industry, I would appreciate your insights on the potential trajectories of these two companies.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA):\n\nNVIDIA has solidified its position as a leader in AI hardware and chip technology. The company\u2019s GPUs are integral to various applications, from gaming to data centers and autonomous vehicles. Recently, NVIDIA\u2019s market capitalization surpassed Microsoft\u2019s, making it the world\u2019s second-largest company by market cap.  \ufffc\n\nHowever, the emergence of competitors like China\u2019s DeepSeek, which has developed a cost-effective AI model, poses potential challenges. DeepSeek\u2019s advancements have raised questions about the sustainability of high capital expenditures by US tech companies on AI.  \ufffc\n\nAdditionally, recent geopolitical developments, such as the imposition of new tariffs by the U.S. on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, have led to market volatility. NVIDIA\u2019s stock experienced a decline, which some attribute to these tariffs and the competitive pressures from companies like DeepSeek.  \ufffc\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT):\n\nMicrosoft continues to be a dominant force in software and cloud computing. The company\u2019s strategic integration of AI across its product suite and its partnership with OpenAI underscore its commitment to innovation. In Q1 2025, Microsoft reported a 16% year-over-year increase in revenue, with the Microsoft Cloud division seeing a 22% surge.  \ufffc\n\nHowever, analysts have raised concerns about Microsoft\u2019s reliance on NVIDIA for its AI and cloud computing efforts. As competitors develop custom AI processors, Microsoft\u2019s dependence on third-party hardware could impact its competitive position.  \ufffc\n\nConsiderations:\n\t\u2022\tGrowth Potential vs. Stability: NVIDIA offers significant growth potential, especially with the increasing demand for AI applications. However, this comes with higher volatility due to market competition and geopolitical factors. Microsoft provides a more diversified portfolio, potentially offering more stability but with comparatively moderate growth prospects.\n\t\u2022\tValuation: NVIDIA\u2019s rapid ascent has led to high valuations, which may be susceptible to market corrections. Microsoft\u2019s valuation, while also elevated, is supported by its diverse revenue streams.\n\t\u2022\tRisk Factors: NVIDIA faces risks from emerging competitors and geopolitical tensions affecting its supply chain. Microsoft\u2019s risks include its dependency on external hardware providers and the need to continually innovate in the competitive cloud space.\n\nGiven these factors, I\u2019m interested in the community\u2019s perspective. Which company do you believe offers a better investment opportunity over the next year, considering the current market dynamics and potential risks? Your insights and any additional considerations would be greatly appreciated.",

(NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n\n\u201cWe obviously have huge respect for Jensen,\u201d Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. \u201cWhen it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they\u2019re physically inside\u201d the country, he added.\n\nWhile the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang\u2019s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created \u201cGPU haves and GPU have nots.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cOn that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.\u201d\n\nKrishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a \u201cfailure\u201d and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nHuang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. \u201cChina has 50% of the world\u2019s AI developers, and it\u2019s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,\u201d he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.\n\nKrishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump\u2019s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies\u2019 access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.\n\n\u201cThese deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,\u201d said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. \u201cMost of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.\u201d",

        "selftext": "\nPlug Power, a leading provider of hydrogen fuel cell systems, recently secured a $1.6 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to expand its operations and accelerate its clean energy initiatives. This loan is part of the DOE\u2019s efforts to foster innovation in green energy technologies.\n\nThe potential impact on Plug Power\u2019s stock from this loan could be significant in several ways:\n\nPositive Sentiment and Investor Confidence: The loan may be seen as a sign of confidence from the federal government in Plug Power's technology and business model. This could attract more investors and drive the stock price higher, particularly in the context of growing interest in clean energy.\n\nImproved Financial Position: The loan provides Plug Power with additional liquidity, which can be used for research, development, and scaling its operations, potentially improving its long-term growth prospects. This could also help alleviate concerns about cash flow or financing challenges.\n\nMarket Expansion: If Plug Power successfully uses the funds to expand its hydrogen infrastructure, it could strengthen its position in the growing hydrogen fuel market. This would likely increase the company's future earnings potential, which could positively affect its stock value.\n\nRisks and Market Volatility: On the flip side, the loan could raise concerns about increased debt or reliance on government support. Some investors might view the loan as a sign that Plug Power is struggling to attract private funding or is too reliant on public assistance, which could have a negative impact on the stock.\n\nIn the short term, the announcement of the loan could result in positive stock movement as investors anticipate stronger growth and government backing. However, the long-term effects will depend on how effectively the company uses the funds and its ability to achieve profitability while managing its debt load.\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "Nasdaq Index: A Bubble About to Burst",
        "selftext": "### Nasdaq Index: A Bubble About to Burst\n\nOver the past six years, I have been deeply immersed in the financial markets, conducting thorough and continuous analysis through various methods, patterns, and analytical schools. Today, I would like to share with you a bold opinion that may seem unreasonable to some, but I am confident in its accuracy: the current prices of the Nasdaq Index are merely a reflection of a massive bubble that is about to burst.\n\n#### Current Economic and Political Conditions\n\nLet's look at the broader context of recent economic and political events. Inflation in the United States has reached unprecedented levels in decades, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates repeatedly. These rate increases lead to tighter liquidity, making financing more expensive and reducing consumer and investment spending. This has significantly impacted multiple sectors, including technology, which constitutes a large portion of the Nasdaq Index components.\n\n#### Impact of Inflation and Interest Rates\n\nHigh inflation means that living and production costs increase, reducing the ability of companies to achieve substantial profits. Technology companies, in particular, are heavily affected due to their significant reliance on cheap financing to grow their businesses. As interest rates rise, these companies' ability to borrow and grow diminishes, leading to a decline in their market value.\n\n#### Expected Scenario for the Nasdaq Index\n\nImagine this scenario: upon the Nasdaq Index reaching levels between 20,500 and 20,700 , the bubble that has inflated illogically will start to burst. This burst will lead to a dramatic drop that may reach levels between 18,400 and 18,800 in the short term. But the story does not end there. Considering potential corrections and the breaking of these supports, the drop could accelerate until the index reaches astonishing levels of approximately 16,700.\n\n#### Potential Recession and Economic Contraction\n\nThis anticipated drop is not just a number on a screen but a signal of a severe financial crisis that could ravage the American economy and leave a deep impact on global markets. Major companies will see their values shrink, leading to a loss of market confidence and increasing pressure on the entire financial system. With declining investments and rising unemployment rates, the likelihood of an economic recession and severe contraction increases.\n\nFor example, we can look at the global financial crisis of 2008, where the collapse of the housing market led to the downfall of major financial institutions and a significant rise in unemployment rates. Similarly, the economic crisis of the early 2000s, known as the dot-com bubble, saw a dramatic collapse in tech stock prices, leading to an economic recession.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the American Economy\n\nThe current situation of the Nasdaq Index clearly indicates the unsustainability of high prices. The bubble we see today is built on unrealistic expectations and inflated market values. The anticipated drop will soon confirm the accuracy of this analysis, serving as a real test of the resilience of the economy and financial markets. In this scenario, we might witness a significant economic contraction, with a sharp decline in economic activities and rising unemployment rates, putting immense pressure on both the American and global economies.\n\nTherefore, I urge you to take this analysis seriously and exercise caution in your investment strategies. The bubble is about to burst, and the major drop will come unexpectedly and swiftly.\n\nThank you, and I hope this analysis serves as an early warning for those seeking a deeper understanding of the current state of the Nasdaq Index and financial markets in general. Prepare yourselves, as the financial storm is approaching, and the upcoming events may change the face of the economy as we know it.\n\nTamer Omar, Analyst and Financial Markets Enthusiast\nDate: June 17, 2024\nTime: 21:17 PM (UTC+2)",

This news happened afterhours yesterday (which is why all the car companies had a weird spike at the close). This is a rehash of the 25% tariff on all imported cars which was announced ahead of 'Liberation Day', so I don't think this should ultimately shouldn't have a massive effect on these stocks unless there are additional tariffs. 25% tariffs on imports of automobiles/automobile parts have been known for a while, so at this point I'll wait to see how car companies react at the open. The highest risk at the moment are retaliatory tariffs from Canada.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cch5b3lg7swe1.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebb18fc1b877015b667a978b4a9cc7e5a9aa0a3b\n\n[**INDA (India** ETF**)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INDA&p=d)\\- Pakistan has suspended all trade with India, closed its airspace to Indian airlines, and rejected India's claims regarding a Kashmir attack, escalating tensions between the two nations. The geopolitical tension between the two countries has been going on for close to 100 years, watching to see if there's more escalation between the two countries. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iprnnjod7swe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=57ca3f4b5dd662a28cee4a025c07f646c05debcf\n\n[**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&p=d)\\- American Airlines reported Q1 earnings with an EPS of -$0.59 vs. -$0.69 expected and revenue of $12.6B vs. $12.5B expected. The company withdrew its FY outlook and provided weak Q2 guidance based on current demand trends. Interested in $9 level. Overall bearish but no position. AAL has fallen close to 50% since February, so I'm mainly interested to see if there is any chance of economic turnaround. There are some knock-on effects from tariffs due to fuel costs/economic prosperity of travelers for discretionary spending. Risks are typically continued persistently weak demand and operational disruptions (further plane accidents).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdckl5lh7swe1.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=221518b66b4929220bd7de449562a09c42566f49\n\n[**ZIM (ZIM Integrated Shipping Services)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ZIM&p=d)**,** [**SBLK (Star Bulk Carriers)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SBLK&p=d)**,** [**MATX (Matson, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MATX&p=d)\\- Flexport (a supply chain logistics platform) reported a 60% decline in ocean freight bookings from China to the U.S. since new tariffs took effect, leading carriers to cancel a quarter of sailings and reroute capacity to other trade lanes. Overall more of a swing trade for the long term rather than a day trade, interested primarily in MATX. The shipping industry is experiencing significant disruptions due to trade policy changes; we'll likely see earnings affect a ton of these stocks and I'm interested if they give outlook during earnings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ju4hgpoi7swe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b660a47eb92cb7df7f23822a773adcd5516dee94\n\n**Earnings:** [**GOOG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d), [**TMUS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TMUS&p=d), [**GILD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GILD&p=d)",

        "selftext": "As the specter of war looms over Europe, the need to bolster our collective defense has never been more urgent. Russia\u2019s continued aggression against Ukraine is not just a distant conflict\u2014it is a direct threat to European stability, security, and our way of life. In times like these, our ancestors knew what to do: they bought War Bonds, funding the war effort and ensuring victory over tyranny. Today, we must do the same, but in a modern way\u2014by investing in Europe's defense industry.  \n  \nWhy Invest in EU Defense Companies?  \nThe war in Ukraine has exposed critical gaps in Europe's defense readiness. Ammunition stockpiles are dwindling, air defenses need expansion, and military technology must advance to counter Russia\u2019s evolving threats. EU defense giants like Leonardo S.p.A., Rolls-Royce Holdings (RR.LSE), Airbus SE are leading the charge in equipping European and Ukrainian forces with the tools they need to defend democracy.  \n  \nBy investing in these companies, we achieve three crucial objectives:  \n  \n1. Strengthening European Security \u2013 The more we invest in defense, the better prepared Europe is to deter aggression and protect NATO allies.  \n  \n2. Supporting Ukraine\u2019s War Effort \u2013 Ukraine\u2019s survival depends on continuous military aid. European defense firms are at the forefront of supplying tanks, drones, artillery, and air defense systems.  \n  \n3. Boosting the EU Economy \u2013 Defense investments create jobs, drive technological innovation, and ensure Europe\u2019s self-reliance in military production.  \n  \nA Moral and Strategic Investment  \nThis is not just about financial returns\u2014this is about ensuring the survival of European values in the face of an existential threat. Much like the citizens of the 1940s who bought War Bonds to defeat fascism, we must step up today. Every investment in an EU defense company is an investment in Europe\u2019s strength, Ukraine\u2019s survival, and the deterrence of future conflicts.  \n  \nRussia is betting on our complacency. Let\u2019s prove them wrong. Support Europe\u2019s defense industry\u2014our freedom depends on it.",

        "title": "Trump Announces Chips, Drug Probes, Opening Door to Tariffs",
        "selftext": "[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-announces-chips-drug-probes-204108780.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-announces-chips-drug-probes-204108780.html)\n\n(Bloomberg) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s administration pressed forward with plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports by initiating probes led by the Commerce Department.\n\nThe moves, announced Monday in the Federal Register, are a precursor to imposing tariffs and threaten to broaden the president\u2019s sweeping US trade war.\n\nThe Commerce Department said it would be investigating the impact on US national security of \u201cimports of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment\u201d as well as \u201cpharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, including finished drug products\u201d in a pair of notices posted to the Federal Register.\n\nThe US president has long decried foreign production of drugs and chips as a threat to national security and threatened to slap tariffs on imports in a bid to revive American manufacturing of those products. But the duties could also wreak havoc on supply chains and drive up costs for Americans.\n\nNew levies threaten to roil a chips industry that notched more than $600 billion in global sales of chips essential to products ranging from cars to airplanes and mobile phones to consumer electronics. Semiconductor supply chains still feeling the effect of disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic now could face new strains from the US duties.\n\nThe administration\u2019s announcement came days after it exempted semiconductors, mobile phones, computers and other electronics imports from 145% duties applied to China. That announcement was seen as a boon to tech giants like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., but Trump and his advisers quickly said the relief would be short lived and that separate levies would be placed on chips.\n\nTariffs would also be a blow to the world\u2019s largest drugmakers, including Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly & Co., virtually all of which operate scores of manufacturing sites scattered across the globe.\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly bemoaned US drugmakers\u2019 reliance on overseas production, is breaking decades of tradition. The pharmaceutical industry has long side-stepped trade wars, protected by international agreements that largely protected medicines from tariffs on humanitarian grounds.\n\nTrump\u2019s move on semiconductors is similar to the way he\u2019s targeted other sectors, with imported steel, aluminum and automobiles already facing 25% tariffs and an ongoing Commerce Department trade probe expected to result in levies on foreign copper. The president has also vowed tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals and possibly critical minerals.\n\nUnder Biden, the US already had doubled tariffs on so-called legacy semiconductors from China to 50% and last December launched a probe into Chinese concentration in the category that sets the stage for Trump to impose even higher levies. While not as advanced as chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous in autos, airplanes, medical devices and telecommunications.\n\nTrump has cast reshoring chipmaking and revitalizing the US industrial base as essential for the nation\u2019s security. Winning a global race to dominate the AI industry is also a top Trump administration priority. Analysts have warned that bringing chip manufacturing to the US will take years of hard work work.\n\n**Worldwide Impact**\n\nThe move on medicines will have an outsize effect on Ireland, with a $54 billion (\u20ac47.6 billion) trade surplus with the US that helped spur Trump\u2019s wrath. The imbalance, heavily weighted by the pharmaceutical industry, stems from the country\u2019s favorable tax regime and highly educated workforce. US drug companies, including Lilly and Pfizer Inc., operate nearly two dozen factories in Ireland that ship drugs to the US, according to a TD Cowen analysis.\n\nThe US biotech industry, which drives much of the innovation in drug development, is also vulnerable to the new tariffs. Nearly 90% of American companies rely on imported components for US-approved products, according to a recent survey by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. As a result, the supply of medicines for US patients and families are particularly vulnerable to proposed tariffs on the European Union, China and Canada, the group wrote.\n\nNearly all of the companies surveyed said they expect manufacturing costs to surge if import tariffs are placed on the European Union. Half of the 42 companies said they\u2019d be forced to scramble for new research and manufacturing partners or they\u2019d need to rework or potentially delay regulatory filings for new products.\n\n\u201cRe-onshoring key parts of the biotechnology supply chain to the U.S. and our allies and strengthening the American manufacturing base should be a high priority for both national and economic security,\u201d BIO President John Crowley said in a statement. \u201cIt will take years, though, for this shift. We need to be mindful of the negative consequences of these proposed tariffs.\u201d\n\n**Trump\u2019s Exemptions**\n\nThe US president earlier Monday announced he would consider temporary reprieves from his 25% tariff on automotive imports to allow companies time to bring production to the US.\n\nThe announcement suggested that the president was willing to negotiate with industry leaders, and a similar push from technology and pharmaceutical executives is almost certain to follow.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to get this onshoring to happen as soon as possible and as orderly as possible,\u201d Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Monday on Fox Business. \u201cAnd so when he talks to CEOs and they say, \u2018Hey, I need a little more time with this, I need a little time more more time with that,\u2019 then he\u2019s absolutely willing to listen. And if he\u2019s convinced, then he\u2019ll make the call to do something like he did today.\u201d\n\nTrump was asked what short-lived product exclusions he was considering but did not specify how long a potential pause or lowering of auto levies would remain in place.",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nWell, yesterday was crazy. Today I'm somewhat negatively biased because obviously this 90 day tariff pause doesn't change too much narratively in the market beyond less chaos (for now)- we still need to negotiate with every country that we plan to place tariffs on while China is still the elephant in the room and the US needs to face them down\n\nShorter format today, my sleep schedule has been terrible due to premarket/regular/afterhours/overnight trading.\n\nNews: [US Stock Futures Rise As Dip Buyers Emerge After Selloff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/us-stock-futures-rise-as-dip-buyers-emerge-after-selloff)\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\-Tesla surged nearly 20% following the announcement of a 90-day delay on tariffs above 10%, relieving immediate pressure on its China-based operations. Signs of internal conflict within the White House (he called Navarro dumber than a sack of bricks lol) signal some political risk. \n\nOverall, biased negatively today sheerly because there's been no real change in tariffs beyond the 90 day delay. Level I'm watching is 250 (far, I know), frankly don't know which way or how far the market will turn after the open today though.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wcgq9jd0b0ue1.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&s=a645a601b2e8b7ccb9d7fb02a1a8198cac7977e1\n\n[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\\-A major potential loser if China retaliates with its own tariffs, given its reliance on Chinese manufacturing. (80% iPhone manufacturing done in China). While past trade tensions like in 2019 saw exemptions on key iPhone parts, it\u2019s unlikely similar measures will be granted again. Overall, biased short today. We broke $200 yesterday, I kicked out of my position at $190-$195 so looking for a place to re-enter if needed \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l527whbya0ue1.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd7f988042095cfa8c07a0cd66fc9bafb566bdec\n\n[**X (United States Steel)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=X&p=d)\\-President Trump called for a new review of the U.S. Steel\u2013Nippon Steel deal, stating a clear preference to keep the company American-owned. This entire deal is a mess. Frankly at this point, I'm only going to buy the stock if there is a clear buyer like Nippon, which is the only way I see a viable trade in this now. Keeping track of the narrative and incremental headlines is frankly a difficult way to earn money vs the tariff trades that are possible.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lm2yyxf1b0ue1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c210feb15e74e4a413383b70d282fcd8b02edaa5\n\n[**KMX (CarMax)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=KMX&p=d)\\-EPS of $0.58 vs $0.65 exp on revenue of $6.00B vs $5.69B exp.

Used auto demand remains mixed, with macro headwinds impacting affordability and dealer traffic. Despite stronger earnings, volume misses suggest softness (this should be stronger due to people trying to buy cars due to tariffs).

        "selftext": "Hi everyone ! \n\nI'm french and since Trump is President of US, i've decided to focus on European Market, and today, i would like to talk with you about Air Liquide.\n\nFounded in 1902, Air Liquide operates in 75 countries and serves more than 3.9 million customers and patients. The company focuses on the production and distribution of industrial, medical, and specialty gases, as well as innovative solutions for industry and healthcare.\n\nIn 2024, the group\u2019s revenue reached \u20ac27.06 billion, reflecting a 2.6% growth on a comparable basis. Air Liquide emphasizes sustainable development and innovation, particularly in the fields of energy transition and artificial intelligence.\n\nWhy i chose Air Liquide as one of my best european stock : \n\n\\- They will not be really affected by Tariff thanks  stong local presence in US. Air Liquide has a significant footprint in the U.S. with production sites and an extensive distribution network. This reduces its reliance on imports and limits the direct impact of tariffs on its local operations.\n\n\\- Strong place in AI market : data center cooling, semi conductor manufacturing (some specific gas are needed)\n\n\\- and every two years, Air Liquid give one stock for 10 hold stocks.\n\nOpinion from some analyst expert : \n\n>After failing at the \u20ac175 resistance zone in late September 2024, the stock consolidated before finding support at \u20ac153 following an excessive decline. It then regained the \u20ac160 zone, a medium-term support level that will serve as our pivot point. The stock rebounded above this level before pausing after another test of \u20ac175.\n\n>The bullish gap opened on February 21 represents a technical event that allowed the stock to break above \u20ac175, reach new all-time highs, and unlock further upside potential.\n\n>From a technical indicator perspective, the 20-day and 50-day moving averages are trending positively below the price. Meanwhile, the RSI remains in positive territory. Additionally, the orientation of the Bollinger Bands supports a continuation of the upward movement.\n\n>Thus, as long as the stock remains above \u20ac160, a new leg of the uptrend is expected, with an initial target of testing \u20ac190, followed by \u20ac200. However, a close below \u20ac160 would signal a potential consolidation phase.\n\n",

Snip Snap! Snip Snap! Snip Snap!\" -Michael Scott. \n\nAnyway back to the watchlist. \n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- Seen a significant bounce in TSLA due to the news of the lessened (supposedly) future tariffs\u2014interested in seeing if we can break above $260 at open; otherwise, not interested and likely still will be negatively biased. This might actually be reacting a little positively due to BYD's blowout earnings. BYD reported $107B annual revenue for the year and are close to TSLA's profit! Mainly concerned in the long run about margin compression due to pricing cuts, increased competition in the EV space, macro headwinds, and of course, Elon making fork sculptures in the White House but no one appreciating them. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bz5gjzq91nqe1.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=a83568b9f60ae3ac383f8b4247fc5cc074c86da6\n\n[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\\- MicroStrategy buys 6,911 more of the underlying, now holds over 506k, currently at 2x premium. Nothing too interesting to note beyond the typical upwards move from whenever MSTR announces a buy of the underlying. We've bounced slightly off the lows, but worth noting that the underlying is also rose from news that Trump might use his gold holdings to buy more. I always keep in mind MSTR's heavy dependence on underlying performance, regulatory scrutiny, and volatility, of course. Related tickers to watch on this are RIOT and COIN/HOOD.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2qc9jsi81nqe1.png?width=1533&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd1818fbcb5e696c4bfbfd7759f7fd4b70d813bc\n\n[**LUNR (Intuitive Machines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d)\\- Reported strong Q4 and FY24 results.

Overall backlog seemed to be the second most important factor, signifies that there is future revenue and they are far more financially stable than anticipated and even profitable by year end! I have a very small position long. Going to bail if we break below $7 but overall I think there are many tailwinds that can help LUNR. **L**UNR's main risks are execution risk tied to lunar missions (beginning of this month saw the stock fall close to 50% in a single day), contract delays, reliance on government funding, and high R&D intensity with limited margin buffer/no defined return.

        "selftext": "So, Trump mumbled and fumbled through his flashy \u201cTariff Board\u201d presentation, a huge, colorful piece showing new trade tariffs targeting nearly every major U.S. trading partner, all the way to pinguin land. But one name was **suspiciously absent**: **Russia**.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* Russia holds resources the U.S. critically needs.\n* Trump is playing a long game: wait for allies to retaliate \u2192 \"forced\" to trade with Russia.\n* Canada's exemption was temporary : a Potash move.\n* This isn't about tariffs. It's about materials, shortages, and leverage.\n* The markets might create opportunity again\n\n# The U.S. Needs Resources. Russia Has Them.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the facts. The U.S. is highly dependent on imports for materials vital to defense, EVs, aerospace, and energy:\n\n|Material|U.S. Import Reliance|Russia\u2019s Global Role|**Why It Matters**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Rare Earths|95\u2013100%|5th largest reserves|U.S. wants to move away from Chinese REEs.|\n|Uranium|\\>90% (100% enriched fuel)|\\~25% of U.S. reactor fuel|U.S. reactors literally can't run without Russian fuel until 2028.|\n|Palladium|\\~100%|40% of global production|Vital for catalytic converters. 32% of U.S. imports came from Russia.|\n|Nickel|50\u201360%|3rd largest producer|Needed for EV batteries. Russia = 7% of U.S. imports.|\n|Titanium|100% (sponge)|Largest global producer|Crucial for aerospace and defense. No U.S. sponge capacity.|\n|Potash|93%|\\#2 exporter (9% of U.S. supply)|Key for agriculture and food prices.|\n|Platinum|\\~83%|Major source (after S. Africa)|Used in auto and electronics.|\n|Aluminum|High import share|Russia offered 2M tons/year|U.S. needs cheap supply for industry.|\n\nLong story short: The U.S. cannot function (militarily, economically, or industrially) without some of the materials that Russia controls. Canada, usually the US.\u2019s safe trade partner, got special love recently. Why? Because maybe (and finally) someone figured out Potash is pretty critical to US agriculture.\n\nPotash is used in fertilizer, and Canada supplies \\~75% of US imports. But Russia still holds \\~9% of US potash imports (2023), and it\u2019s the #2 exporter globally. For now, it's in his interest to have a temporary relationship until he secures potash access from Russia again. Expect that Canadian friendliness to cool off once he reopens backchannels with Moscow.\n\n# The Strategy: Delay, Escalate, Justify\n\nHere's the potential playbook\n\n1. Publicly slap tariffs on everyone (except Russia).\n2. Wait for retaliations from EU, China, even Canada.\n3. Claim national industry is being \u201csqueezed.\u201d\n4. Play the \u201cI\u2019m forced to look elsewhere\u201d card.\n5. Re-open resource deals with Russia, framed as \u201ceconomic necessity.\u201d\n\nThis way, Trump gets to avoid political blowback for \u201ccozying up to Putin\u201d and instead paints it as a \u201ctough decision\u201d driven by supply chain realities. That he is wildly considered a Russian asset is just the icing on the cake.\n\nAlso, you have currently a lot of US companies being interested in rare materials from Russia. Kinda convenient if you don't need to import/export tax them. Right?\n\nWhile we're at it ... suddenly all of the pressure and would-be robbing of Ukraine makes a whole lot more sense now.\n\n# BTW, U.S.\u2013Russia Trade Still Exists (Even If Quietly)\n\nEven with sanctions, U.S.\u2013Russia trade in 2024 was worth $3.5 billion, with Russia enjoying a $2.5B surplus. That\u2019s more than many tariffed countries. Treasury Sec. Scott Bessent said there\u2019s \u201cno meaningful trade with Russia\u201d, but the numbers don\u2019t lie. The trade is happening but is kept quiet for obvious reasons.\n\n# So... Why Wasn\u2019t Russia on the Tariff Board?\n\nBecause:\n\n* Russia has what the U.S. *cannot* source elsewhere, at least not quickly or cheaply.\n* Trump needs Russia as a Plan B once his tariff war escalates.\n* Calling on Russia later gives him negotiating power now.\n* His ties with Russia go too deep to untangle\n\nRussia is the emergency supplier Trump doesn\u2019t want to talk about, until he can say \u201cI had no choice.\u201d\n\n# What about the market?\n\nExpect a sell-off first (markets hate uncertainty), followed by **sector-specific rebounds** if supply shocks are eased.\n\n# Potential Winners:\n\n|Sector|Why|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Defense & Aerospace (RTX, LMT, BA)**|**titanium & PGA** Access to Russian and rare alloys = resumed production stability.|\n|**EV & Battery (TSLA (PROB NOT BECAUSE FKN ELON), ALB, LAC)**|**nickel,cobalt, graphite** If Russia supplies or cost pressures on battery makers ease.|\n|**Fertilizer & Ag (NTR, MOS, CF)**|**potash** Russian has lower input costs. Food price inflation slows.|\n|**Utilities (NEE, DUK)**|**uranium** U.S.  need Russian  . Easing pressure on fuel supply = higher stability.|\n|**Shipping & Logistics (ZIM, MATX)**|New trade routes or adjustments to supply chains = demand spike for transport services. This will also be the case for the shifting markets, most likely increased trading will occur between EU and AMEA.|\n\n# Potential Losers:\n\n|Sector|Why|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Domestic Mining (MP Materials, UUUU)**|**cheap Russian imports** U.S. rare earth/nickel/uranium firms lose pricing power|\n|**Allied Trade Partners (EU-focused ETFs, Canadian stocks)**|Allies retaliate \u2192 tariffs hurt export-led companies.|\n|**Consumer Discretionary (AMZN, TGT)**|General trade war-driven inflation might raise prices and reduce consumer spending.|\n|**ESG / Green Funds**|Optics of trading with Russia may clash with fund mandates, leading to outflows.|",

Secretary Lutnick announced yesterday \"Tariffs compromise announcement will likely come tomorrow\", so will be on the lookout for that.\n\nNews:\u00a0[Trump Hails Tariffs as US Economy Barrels Into Trade Wars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-to-tout-tariffs-unveil-energy-mineral-projects-in-speech)\n\n**Ticker:**\u00a0[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)**,**\u00a0[**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)**,**\u00a0[**SMH (Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)**,**\u00a0[**SOXL (3x Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SOXL&p=d)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjj40i7bqvme1.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=987528adda3e74576a8fd3887a4480465f894bab\n\n**Catalyst:**\u00a0Trump has called for an end to the CHIPS Act Subsidy Program (instead preferring tariffs).\n\n**Technicals:**\u00a0Short biased. Obviously this takes away a lot of investment in semis companies. Extremely negative catalyst but unlikely it will get repealed due to how much bipartisan support it had.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:**\u00a0The CHIPS and Science Act gave $280B in new funding to boost domestic research/manufacturing of semis in the US, and also aimed to strengthen supply chain resilience against China and widely considered to be a success because it spurred the development/dominance in the semis sector in America.\n\n**Risks:**\u00a0If this gets repealed, we're likely going to see a pretty large pullback in the semis. Obviously this is dependent on what the tariffs Trump touts will do as well.\n\n**Ticker:**\u00a0[**GM (General Motors)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&p=d)**,**\u00a0[**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)**,**\u00a0[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1h7tzdq7qvme1.png?width=1525&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0b8b3b6ebc68ca902703e69cdac45741a50ee3a\n\n**Catalyst:**\u00a0The Trump administration is considering granting relief from the recently imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\n**Technicals:**\u00a0We've seen all three stocks (GM especially) make gains due to this announcement, will watch at open for volume.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:**\u00a0The automotive industry in US/Canada/Mexico involves the most economic/manufacturing cooperation in the USMCA, they're the most obvious beneficiaries of this potential catalyst.\n\n**Risks:**\u00a0If they don't actually give relief, then will likely pullback- cars are one of the most affected products of tariffs and pretty much every car company has spoken about tariffs on their earnings calls.\n\n**Ticker:**\u00a0[**IBIT (IBIT)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBIT&p=d)**,**\u00a0[**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**,**\u00a0[**HOOD (Robinhood Markets)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/trhlv0e8qvme1.png?width=1015&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccda137edc3a6606919e6a1ffd5b515b4602a527\n\n**Catalyst:**\u00a0Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that Trump plans to grant the main biggest CC a \"unique status\" within the Bitcoin reserve strategy, which will be unveiled at the White House CC Summit on Friday.\n\n**Technicals:**\u00a0We've seen the underlying spike close to 8-9% since yesterday, watching $90K level. Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:**\u00a0Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.\n\n**Risks:**\u00a0Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday. I personally see this more of a \"buy on hype\" kind of catalyst, unless there's an announcement of something extremely bullish I'm not sure how much more this will move the needle.\n\n**Ticker:**\u00a0[**HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HII&p=d)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vl9snv8qvme1.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1ad0e3db19437f55d9d47dea42f6d58c0499513\n\n**Catalyst:**\u00a0Trump has announced initiatives aimed at strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry to counter China's dominance, spoke about the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding and the introduction of special tax incentives.\n\n**Technicals:**\u00a0None that I'm particularly interested in, this is a longer-term play.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:**\u00a0China produces over half of the world's merchant vessels, this is more of a play to reduce reliance on foreign-shipping.\n\n**Risks:**\u00a0There's a chance that this will never happen, Trump tried to create a \"Cybersecurity Department\" in his first term but that was never formally created and we kept those duties spread out between the FBI/DHS/NSA.\n\n**Earnings:**\u00a0[**MRVL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRVL&p=d),\u00a0[**VEEV**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VEEV&p=d),\u00a0[**ZS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ZS&p=d),\u00a0[**MDB**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MDB&p=d)",

Announces that profit could fall by $2B or more due to tariffs and lower EV demand.\n\n**Technicals:** Pretty much broke the $10 level it's been trading around since August, watching to see if it'll sell off more by the open. Highly/infinitely liquid.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The entire automotive industry is challenged by tariffs. F guided lower for 2025.\n\n**Risks:** Obviously these are one of the bigger movers from Mexico tariffs (most cars are assembled in Mexico then shipped to the US).\n\n**Related Tickers:** GM, TSLA, STLA.\n\n**Offhand Comments:** Ford's outlook reflects the broader industry's apprehension about geopolitical factors affecting operations and profitability. Interesting to see how other car companies react to earnings as well. \n\n**Ticker:** [**ARM (Arm Holdings)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARM&p=d)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgaysrki2jhe1.png?width=1524&format=png&auto=webp&s=2229d44cfd94c86bf08df06d6d43e33be6f22616\n\n**Catalyst:** ARM reported EPS of $0.39 vs. $0.34 expected. Revenue of $983 million vs. $959M expected. Buoyed by Deepseek ban news, most likely as well.\n\n**Technicals:** Was down roughly 8% after earnings, but seems to be somewhat recovering after Deepseek news.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Semiconductor sector is experiencing heightened demand, especially after PLTR's comments that the AI train will never stop. We're seeing growth in data center applications, the main driver of semis purchases.\n\n**Risks:** Despite strong performance, Arm's lowered full-year revenue forecast has led to a 6% drop in its shares.\n\n**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC.\n\n\n\n**Ticker:** [**RBLX (Roblox Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zza4rswg2jhe1.png?width=1524&format=png&auto=webp&s=29ea176849738eb294445a28792ea3cef6edf3bb\n\n**Catalyst:** Roblox Corporation reported earnings with an EPS of -$0.33 vs. -$0.46 expected. Revenue of $988.2M vs. $967.2M expected.\n\n**Technicals:** $50 is the clear level here, note that earnings were released premarket rather than aftermarket yesterday. Seems to be a massive overreaction selloff (but has recovered somewhat).\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The gaming industry is witnessing substantial growth, with increased user engagement and monetization strategies. Roblox's 32% year-over-year revenue increase reflects its expanding user base and effective monetization, despite missing revenue expectations.\n\n**Risks:** IIRC Roblox isn't profitable yet- they're focusing on growth/revenue over profits, but most of their costs are outside their control (platform fees like the Apple store, developers, infrastructure for trust/safety for minors).\n\n**Related Tickers:** EA, TTWO.\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vlnj4wsf2jhe1.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1203dd29a938f2625e8d8c19fb6e38b8fd43813\n\n**Catalyst:** DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has temporarily suspended its API service top-ups due to server resource constraints. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to ban DeepSeek's chatbot application from government-owned devices over data security concerns.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The AI industry is under increased scrutiny regarding data security and geopolitical tensions but that's grown more laissez-faire under Trump. DeepSeek's service suspension and potential U.S. government ban helps American chip makers and NVDA especially, due to their continued dominance.\n\n**Risks:** Deepseek getting banned will likely lead to greater reliance on American AI chatbots, spurring growth in American semis manufacturers.\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM.\n\n**Offhand Comments:** (I am currently long).\n\n\n\n**Ticker:** [**SWKS (Skyworks Solutions)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWKS&p=d)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tegelh4e2jhe1.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=4aaffaef7c0c9cd835c649d22a233ce94962b0cb\n\n**Catalyst:** EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.57 expected. Revenue of $1.07B vs 1.07B expected. Reports $2B stock buyback plan.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching the $60 level, we've had a brutal fall from $90->$60. If we get closer I'm interested in some small bounce depending on volume/size of the move.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SWKS supplies some of the chips for Apple's iPhone, and their iPhone sales haven't done too well recently- thus this has a knock-on effect by affecting SWKS's sales.\n\n**Risks:** SWKS projected a revenue decline for the mobile segment and issued a lower profit forecast. They stated they anticipated a \"mid-to-high teens decline in mobile.\"\n\n**Related Tickers:** QCOM, AVGO, TXN.\n\n**Earnings today:** [**AMZN**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&p=d).",

Tariffs on Mexico/Canada are delayed, but we still have tariffs on China, and tariffs have been promised by Trump on the EU.\n\nNews: [As Trump Tariffs Take Effect, China Retaliates With Trade Measures Against U.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-tariffs-news?unlocked_article_code=1.uU4.ps2-.DRzgfM1GnN9i)\n\n**Ticker:** [**PLTR**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.14 vs. $0.11 expected. Revenue of $828 million vs. $777 million expected. Management highlighted the power of AI and their sizable contracts, citing the nature of the AI war being winner-take-all.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w0mxwpift4he1.png?width=1016&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee6f5c768b3241a4691c43f9678a22749e720617\n\n**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.\n\n**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MSFT, GOOGL, IBM, AMZN\n\n**Ticker:** **NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vczaawxct4he1.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=89155278080b4d882225513d7d20e8abb22a41db\n\n**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were \"supposed\" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the \"standard\" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).\n\n**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM, TSM\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba Group Holding Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, aiming to address issues related to drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs effective February 10, including a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine vehicles.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1akqihit4he1.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=ded9896ee723d56295bb0eef739648fb2832d8e1\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The imposition of these tariffs marks a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tension and more volatility to come through Trump tweets.\n\n**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU, TCEHY, PDD\n\n**Offhand Comments:** There are going to be retaliation investigations against companies operating in America, INTC and GOOG have recently been announced as under investigation by China.\n\n\n\n**Ticker:** [**GRAB (Grab Holdings Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRAB&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Grab Holdings Ltd. is considering a takeover of its Indonesian rival, GoTo Group, at a valuation of approximately $7 billion.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t49y9hjt4he1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9d13068f2a7415bc54caab462dfa34ab5ce61a4\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $5 level, no bias.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The potential merger represents a significant consolidation in SEA's ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Mergers typically streamline operations and reduce competition, leading to improved profitability for the combined entity.\n\n**Risks:** The proposed merger may face regulatory hurdles, including antitrust concerns, which could delay or derail the deal.\n\n**Related Tickers:** UBER, DIDI, LYFT, GRAB\n\n**Earnings today:** [**AMD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d), [**GOOG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d), [**MAT**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MAT&p=d), [**SNAP**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNAP&p=d)",

        "selftext": "Traders often blame technical analysis for its supposed dependence on historical data and subjective interpretation. They argue that its predictive power is akin to guessing at coffee grounds and offers no significant advantage over chance. Skeptics point to instances where supposed patterns fail to emerge, demonstrating the fallacy inherent in graphical analysis. Moreover, the proliferation of self-proclaimed experts offering expensive courses and proprietary indicators adds to the skepticism, making technical analysis a breeding ground for scammers.  \n  \nBut those who support technical analysis contrariwise believe that while individual signals may fail, the overall weight of the analysis provides a statistical advantage over time. Thorough research supports this argument by demonstrating the predictive power of certain indicators and patterns. Moreover, proponents of this approach emphasize the practical utility of technical analysis for risk management and decision-making, allowing traders to clearly navigate the markets.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/90gzkdlzu55d1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=34eb06cdcf4365b2daa265218c78c0e8b04c9e22\n\n**Where do these two camps agree?**\n\n  \nRather than viewing it through a binary prism, (which in itself is already superficial and immature)- fraud or science- astute traders recognize it as a tool that can be described as neither infallible nor powerless. Platforms like Trading View or Tamap Tools, where multiple tools complement each other for the most accurate conclusions critically approach technical analysis, capitalizing on its strengths while complementing other forms of analysis such as fundamental research and market sentiment analysis. In doing so, they develop a holistic trading strategy that accounts for uncertainty and capitalizes on opportunities.  \n  \nWhy Does Technical Analysis Work for Some Individuals and Not Work for Others?  \nTechnical analysis isn\u2019t a silver bullet. Its efficacy varies based on several factors:  \n  \nExperience and Education: Like any skill, mastery in technical analysis comes with practice and continued education. Seasoned analysts who have spent years understanding chart nuances often fare better.  \nEmotional Discipline: Even with a perfect analysis, trades can go wrong if an individual lets emotions dictate decisions. Panic selling, overconfidence, or stubbornness can be detrimental.  \nOver-reliance: Banking solely on technical analysis and ignoring fundamental factors can be a pitfall. The most successful traders often use a combination of both.  \nMisinterpretation: Indicators and patterns can sometimes be misread, leading to incorrect predictions. Moreover, not all recognized patterns guarantee a particular outcome; they merely suggest possible outcomes with certain probabilities.  \n  \nIn the crucible of financial markets, where fortunes are made and lost in the blink of an eye, technical analysis is a trusted ally for the sophisticated trader. While critics decry its flaws and charlatans exploit its charms, the truth is in the hands of those who wield it skillfully and use it in their analysis.15:07  \n",

        "title": "Passive Investing: Benefits, Challenges, and the Hybrid Approach",
        "selftext": "This is a long one, so I made interim summaries to keep the main points clear.\n\nI'm working on a quant model aimed at outperforming the SPY at similar risk levels. The motivation behind this is the challenge of choosing the right passive products and the fact that most managed portfolios have underperformed the SPY.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on the hybrid model I\u2019m working on or any experience you\u2019ve had with quant models.\n\nThanks!\n\n**So, let's start...**  \n  \nThe meteoric rise in popularity of the passive investment approach is overall a positive trend for retail investors. However, there\u2019s one critical point I\u2019d like to emphasize\u2014there\u2019s no such thing as truly passive investing. At least, not in an absolute sense. So, after dropping that bombshell, let me dive into the details.\n\n# Passive Investing\n\nThe passive investment approach is based on studies showing that the chances of outperforming the benchmark or market return through active portfolio management are notably low. Yes, some fund managers manage to beat the index, and they often make headlines. But studies reveal that a manager who has beaten their chosen benchmark doesn\u2019t necessarily keep outperforming it consistently.\n\nSo, a manager might have a good year, or even a few. But in the long run\u2014this is the key point\u2014it just doesn\u2019t work. Another aspect of these studies is that even if a skilled manager can beat the benchmark, the likelihood of investors finding and choosing that manager among all others is, in itself, quite low.\n\n**Interim Summary:** *Fund managers don\u2019t consistently beat the index, and investors don\u2019t consistently pick the managers who do.*\n\n# Passive Investment Products\n\nThe widespread success and understanding of passive investing benefits are visible in the huge range of passive investment products. This vast supply reflects high demand but also creates complexity, which I\u2019ll highlight further.\n\nPassive products, like index-tracking ETFs, are diversified, have low management fees, and enable investors to follow indexes or groups of stocks based on common themes like blockchain, electric vehicles, robotics, cannabis, and more.\n\nAs of August 2024, nearly 3,500 ETFs trade on Wall Street, most of them passively managed. Their numbers grow at an impressive double-digit rate year-over-year. But as I previously mentioned, this impressive supply adds complexity, effectively introducing active elements into the passive approach.\n\n# The Small and Medium problems of Passive Investing\n\nWhile studies highlight the effectiveness of the passive approach, it\u2019s particularly efficient over the long term, with research recommending at least a 15-year period. Here\u2019s why:\n\n* In 2008, the S&P 500 fell by 50% during the subprime crisis.\n* In 2018, the S&P dropped 20% between September and October.\n* At the start of 2020, amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the S&P lost 34% in just a few weeks.\n* In 2022, the S&P completed a 27% decline from its peak.\n\n**Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I\u2019m a proponent of passive investing**. But it\u2019s crucial to grasp this long-term factor. Index investing is risky, even over the long term. The risk remains constant year after year, but the ability to recover from declines is the game-changer in passive investing\u2014the long-term horizon is essential.\n\n**Interim Summary:** *Passive investments are effective over the long term, yet most investors struggle to commit to this time frame, and in any case, the choices of tracked index and tracking product are active decisions.*\n\n# Macro and Micro Risks\n\nInvestment risks can be simplified into two categories\u2014macro and micro risks. Looking at passive investing through a risk lens can clarify why it\u2019s so efficient. Essentially, with passive products (index-tracking investments), we neutralize micro risks, as broad diversification protects us from risks associated with specific companies.\n\nConversely, macro risks persist even in passive investments. Passive investing counters macro risks by relying on the investment horizon\u2014the longer the time frame, the greater the ability to recover from downturns.\n\n**Interim Summary:** *Passive investing uniquely addresses both micro and macro risks. In contrast, active investing is exposed to both types of risks and tries to mitigate them through research and forecasting. As we\u2019ve seen, most managers fail to manage these risks effectively and lag behind the indexes over time.*\n\n# The Hybrid Investment Approach \u2013 Something Different\n\nTaking a middle path, Hybrid Invest uses passive instruments exclusively, neutralizing micro risks like passive investing. Here, hybrid management comes into play, combining active and passive approaches.\n\nIn a nutshell, the hybrid investment approach focuses solely on macro risk analysis, using a fixed formula or quantitative model that is unaffected by investor psychology. The result is a portfolio aligned with macroeconomic trends. The implementation remains passive\u2014the portfolio consists of highly liquid, central ETFs. Unlike the active approach, it disregards the microeconomic environment, focusing on index-tracking products.\n\n**Let's revisit the large and small asterisks of passive investing. It\u2019s clear that the hybrid approach addresses both in two ways: (1) adaptation to the macroeconomic environment reduces reliance on the investment horizon, and (2) it offers an active element in selecting the index-tracking product at the core of the passive approach.**\n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\n**I am very interested in your thoughts and whether you know of similar hybrid approaches.** ",

        "selftext": "\nOver the past few years, Tesla\u2019s stock has been propelled by a narrative of future technological breakthroughs and visionary leadership. However, a closer look at the underlying fundamentals\u2014and in particular a comparison with Chinese giant BYD\u2014reveals several concerning points:\n\t\n1.\tSuperior Sales and Market Penetration of BYD\n\t\u2022\tIn 2022, BYD sold approximately 1.86 million new energy vehicles worldwide, compared with Tesla\u2019s 1.31 million deliveries globally (with only about 440,000 delivered in China) [ \ufffc].\n\t\n\u2022\tBYD\u2019s sales figures reflect its diversified product portfolio\u2014from affordable passenger EVs to commercial vehicles and buses\u2014which has allowed it to capture a larger share of the rapidly expanding global market.\n\t\n\u2022\tProminent voices like Charlie Munger have even remarked that in China, \u201cBYD is so much ahead of Tesla that it\u2019s almost ridiculous,\u201d noting that while Tesla has been forced to reduce prices repeatedly, BYD has maintained a pricing discipline that reinforces its quality perception [ \ufffc].\n\t\n2.\tIntegrated Vertical Model and Proprietary IP\n\t\u2022\tBYD\u2019s business model is built on deep vertical integration. It manufactures everything from battery cells (including its innovative blade battery) to complete battery packs, ensuring tighter quality control, faster innovation cycles, and cost efficiencies.\n\t\n\u2022\tIn contrast, Tesla\u2019s battery strategy still depends heavily on external suppliers such as CATL, Panasonic, and LG Energy Solution. While Tesla touts its in-house 4680 cell as revolutionary, independent analysis shows that its energy density improvements (in Wh/kg) are modest compared to the rapid progress made by competitors [see discussion below].\n\t\n\u2022\tBYD\u2019s extensive R&D and robust portfolio of patents in battery technology (and its willingness to license technology to other automakers) suggest that its technological edge isn\u2019t just hype\u2014it translates into real, scalable production improvements. Tesla\u2019s reliance on external providers leaves it vulnerable if those suppliers or competing integrated players (like BYD) drive down costs and improve performance.\n\t\n3.\tLimited Technological Differentiation on Core Battery Metrics\n\t\n\u2022\tA key metric for EV performance is energy density (Wh/kg). Despite much fanfare around Tesla\u2019s battery innovations, the improvements in energy density aren\u2019t dramatically superior to those achieved by BYD and other leading manufacturers.\n\t\n\u2022\tThis calls into question whether Tesla\u2019s premium valuation\u2014built largely on future expectations\u2014can be sustained if its core battery technology isn\u2019t materially better. BYD, on the other hand, combines modest improvements in battery performance with a proven, fully integrated production process that has already translated into higher sales volumes and broader market acceptance.\n\t\n4.\tThe Overvaluation Argument and Market Sentiment\n\t\n\u2022\tTesla\u2019s current market valuation appears to be based on an almost irrational optimism about future robotaxis, autonomous driving, and energy storage breakthroughs\u2014none of which have yet materially improved the company\u2019s profitability or production volumes.\n\t\n\u2022\tWith BYD now not only supplying its own vehicles but also securing contracts as a battery supplier for other major players (including recent agreements where BYD\u2019s FinDreams unit is set to supply Tesla\u2019s Shanghai energy storage facility [ \ufffc]), the narrative that Tesla is the sole leader in battery innovation is weakening.\n\t\n\u2022\tWhen you combine lower vehicle sales numbers, an overreliance on third-party suppliers, and only modest improvements in battery performance, the rationale behind Tesla\u2019s high valuation starts to crumble. Investors may eventually reprice Tesla based on its current fundamentals rather than its lofty future projections.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom this perspective, the argument for shorting Tesla centers on the idea that:\n\t\n\u2022\tBYD\u2019s strong global sales, robust vertical integration, and advanced battery IP are not only outpacing Tesla in key markets (especially in China) but also provide a more sustainable competitive advantage.\n\t\n\u2022\tTesla\u2019s reliance on external suppliers and its relatively modest improvements in core battery metrics (like energy density) suggest that its premium valuation is built on an overly optimistic narrative.\n\t\n\u2022\tIf market sentiment shifts away from these future promises and begins to focus on near-term fundamentals, Tesla could see a significant correction.\n\n\nHad gpt organize my info dump in a readable format . But byd is clearly a company that should be valued more it makes no sense that tesla has it\u2019s current valuation. Also throw in global anti American economic sentiment and anti elon well. Seems to make sense that their stock will decline.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-03/tesla-sales-plunge-63-in-france-the-eu-s-second-biggest-ev-market",

        "selftext": "**1. Valuation Metrics Are Sky-High**  \nPalantir currently trades at a Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of approximately 53.13, significantly higher than industry peers.\n\n[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/PLTR) Even for a growth company, this level of valuation is extreme and implies future growth rates that may be unattainable.\n\n\n\n**2. Revenue Growth Isn\u2019t Scaling as Expected**  \nWhile Palantir\u2019s revenue growth has been solid, it\u2019s showing signs of deceleration:\n\n* FY 2022: 24% year-over-year growth\n* FY 2023 (projected): 18% year-over-year growth\n\nThis deceleration doesn\u2019t justify its premium valuation. Additionally, the company remains heavily reliant on government contracts, which are often lumpy and unpredictable.\n\n**3. Profitability Is Still Questionable**  \nDespite boasting about achieving GAAP profitability recently, Palantir has heavily relied on stock-based compensation (SBC). In fact, SBC accounted for approximately 30% of their operating expenses last quarter, which dilutes shareholder value and raises questions about true profitability.\n\n**4. AI Hype Is Inflating the Bubble**  \nThe market has been overly optimistic about Palantir\u2019s AI capabilities. While their AI Platform (AIP) sounds promising, actual adoption metrics and revenue contribution from AIP remain vague. It\u2019s easy to talk AI; it\u2019s harder to monetize it sustainably.\n\n**5. Insider Selling Signals Lack of Confidence**  \nExecutives have been offloading shares at a significant rate. For instance, Chairman Peter Thiel sold a substantial portion of his holdings recently.\n\n[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-lead-sell-palantir-stock-223000919.html)If the leadership team doesn\u2019t see long-term upside at these prices, why should we?\n\n\n\n**6. Competitive Pressure Is Mounting**  \nPalantir operates in a crowded space with competitors like Snowflake ($SNOW), Databricks, and Microsoft ($MSFT) offering similar or better solutions. Palantir\u2019s dependence on government clients limits its commercial reach in comparison.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nPalantir is an interesting company with solid tech, but the stock price is disconnected from fundamentals. High valuations, slowing growth, heavy SBC, and reliance on government contracts make $PLTR a risky bet at current levels. AI hype has driven the price into bubble territory, and insiders don\u2019t seem confident in its future.\n\nWhat do you think? Is $PLTR worth its valuation, or are we seeing another overhyped tech bubble? Let\u2019s discuss! \ud83d\udc47\n\n*Note: All financial figures are based on the latest available data as of November 2024.*\n\nSources",

        "title": "Tesla's Deliveries Disappoint: Time To Take Profits (Rating Downgrade)",
        "selftext": "**Summary**\n\n* Tesla's stock remains overvalued despite disappointing vehicle delivery numbers and slowing growth.\n* The surge in Tesla's stock price is driven by enthusiasm for AI advancements, Elon Musk's charisma, and Donald Trump's election victory rather than improvements in the company's core business fundamentals.\n* At 126 times projected earnings, Tesla\u2019s valuation is far higher than both industry peers and even Nvidia, making it increasingly difficult to justify its current price.\n* The company's challenges, including declining deliveries, suggest that much of its upside potential has already been priced in.\n* Investors should consider taking profits while the stock is trading at near-record highs.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock has been riding a wave of unprecedented enthusiasm, with its price reaching all-time highs despite recently published delivery numbers that fell short of analysts' expectations. This discrepancy highlights a growing disconnect between Tesla\u2019s market valuation and its actual performance. The company, once known for its relentless growth and innovation, delivered fewer cars in 2024 than in 2023, marking its first-ever year of declining deliveries. Despite this, Tesla\u2019s stock price has surged by 63% in 2024, demonstrating how much investor sentiment rather than fundamental growth is driving its valuation.\n\nIn my October analysis, I discussed how Tesla\u2019s slowing delivery growth and declining net income, despite aggressive price cuts, were becoming evident concerns. Even the highly anticipated robotaxi event failed to deliver the excitement that investors had hoped for, leading to a drop in the stock price at the time. While Tesla was already trading at a premium then, its valuation has only become more stretched in the months since.\n\nThe most recent data on Tesla\u2019s deliveries reveals troubling trends. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company delivered 495,570 vehicles, falling short of the 512,300 deliveries expected by analysts. This shortfall contributed to a total of 1.79 million vehicles delivered for the year, a slight decline from the 1.81 million delivered in 2023. While the drop in deliveries may seem modest, it is significant as it breaks Tesla\u2019s streak of consistent year-over-year growth, which had previously been a hallmark of its success. This is especially notable given the company\u2019s reliance on vehicle sales for approximately 80% of its revenue. Without sustained growth in this area, the rationale for holding Tesla as a growth stock diminishes considerably.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2023, Tesla experienced remarkable growth in deliveries, with annual numbers climbing steadily. However, 2024 marked a departure from this trend, with sales stagnating and then declining. Quarterly delivery figures also highlight the slowdown, with growth peaking in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently stalling. This lack of growth is especially concerning for a company that reinvests all earnings into future expansion rather than paying dividends to shareholders. Tesla\u2019s business model hinges on its ability to grow continuously, and the absence of that growth undermines its investment appeal.\n\nDespite these challenges, Tesla\u2019s stock has soared, buoyed by investor excitement over its advancements in artificial intelligence, Elon Musk\u2019s magnetic persona, and the political implications of Donald Trump\u2019s recent election victory. Musk has repeatedly emphasized Tesla\u2019s position as a leader in AI and robotics, which has further fueled optimism among investors. Additionally, Tesla\u2019s stock experienced significant gains following the November election, with investors speculating that Trump\u2019s administration might ease regulations related to self-driving technology. However, such regulatory changes would only be beneficial if Tesla achieves full autonomy, an ambitious milestone that remains elusive.\n\nTesla\u2019s valuation underscores the risks of the current enthusiasm. The stock is now trading at an extraordinary 126 times projected earnings, a multiple that far exceeds even AI powerhouse Nvidia, which trades at around 42 times earnings. Comparisons with legacy automakers further highlight the disparity. Tesla\u2019s market cap of $1.2 trillion is greater than that of the next 20 largest automakers combined, yet it delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than in 2023. This disconnect raises questions about whether Tesla\u2019s valuation can be justified in the absence of tangible growth.\n\nTesla\u2019s performance relative to Nvidia provides another perspective on the stock\u2019s overvaluation. While both companies have benefited from their association with AI, Tesla\u2019s stock has outperformed Nvidia\u2019s despite facing significant headwinds in its core business. This suggests that investor enthusiasm for Tesla may be outpacing its actual achievements.\n\nAlthough Tesla remains a leader in EV production and is recognized for its innovative technologies, including AI and robotics, these factors are already priced into the stock. The company\u2019s market leadership positions it well to benefit from long-term trends in EV adoption, but its challenges in the short term, including declining deliveries and uncertain profitability from new ventures, make its current valuation appear precarious.\n\nIn conclusion, Tesla\u2019s stock is trading at unsustainable levels given its recent performance. While the company\u2019s technological advancements and market leadership are undeniable, its reliance on investor sentiment rather than business fundamentals makes it a risky investment at these prices. Taking profits now would allow investors to capitalize on the stock\u2019s near-record highs while avoiding potential losses should the market reassess Tesla\u2019s valuation. While the enthusiasm surrounding Tesla may persist in the short term, prudence suggests that this is an opportune moment to exit the position.\n\n",

        "title": "Palantir: Overhyped Valuation and Growing Risks in a Shifting Market",
        "selftext": "Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is trading at valuation levels far exceeding industry norms, raising serious concerns for potential investors. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 64.7x represents a staggering premium of 1,885% over the sector median of 3.2x, while its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 203x highlights a 708% premium compared to the sector median of 25x. For historical context, Microsoft\u2019s P/S ratio peaked at 31x during the dot-com bubble, less than half of Palantir\u2019s current level. Enterprise value metrics further amplify these concerns, with Palantir showing an EV/Sales ratio of 64.8x versus the sector median of 4.1x, and an EV/EBIT ratio of 469.9x compared to 21.4x. Adding to the risks, Palantir's projected earnings growth is slowing, with EPS growth expected to decelerate from 51.7% in 2024 to 25.17% in 2025. In an environment of stagnant interest rates, these extreme valuations heighten the risk of a significant correction, making caution essential for investors.\n\nPalantir\u2019s reliance on government contracts, which accounted for 56% of its revenue\u2014approximately $1.11 billion in the first nine months of 2024\u2014is another critical risk. The Department of Defense represents 70%-80% of these contracts, highlighting Palantir's heavy dependence on a single government segment. This reliance is further compounded by termination-for-convenience clauses, allowing contracts to be canceled with notice periods as short as 3-6 months, and annual renewal requirements due to legal restrictions against multi-year agreements. Palantir also faces high customer concentration risk, with its top three customers contributing 17% of revenue in 2024, down only slightly from 19% in 2023. The Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) initiative, aimed at reducing federal spending, poses additional risks to contract renewals and revenue stability.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock skyrocketed by 144.27% over six months as investors treated Palantir as a high-growth stock. However, this speculative momentum has led to overvaluation and risks of multiple compression\u2014where profits increase but share prices stagnate or decline. For example, Palantir and peers like CrowdStrike (CRWD) and The Trade Desk (TTD) have an average P/E ratio of 395.73%, underscoring significant overpricing. In 2025, a stagnant interest rate environment and reduced consumer spending, driven by inflation adjustments, are likely to further pressure profits and stock performance. The broader market's shift toward stable blue-chip stocks has already reduced speculative investments, as reflected in Bitcoin's trading volume decline from 4.17 million in 2020 to 387,000 in 2024. This changing investor attitude could exacerbate the decline in Palantir\u2019s valuation.\n\nDespite impressive AI-powered platforms like Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo\u2014designed to enhance data integration and decision-making\u2014Palantir faces stiff competition from established tech giants like Microsoft and IBM and specialized firms like Snowflake and Databricks. While the AI boom has driven revenue growth, with a 30% year-over-year increase in Q3 2024, sustainability is a concern as overreliance on AI hype can lead to inflated valuations disconnected from long-term fundamentals. Palantir\u2019s total revenue grew to $726 million in Q3 2024, with U.S. commercial revenue increasing 54% to $179 million, reflecting progress in diversifying beyond government contracts. However, its dependence on AI-driven growth and federal spending still poses significant risks for long-term stability.\n\nHistorical precedents, such as the dot-com bubble, show that companies with extreme valuations, like Cisco and Oracle, faced dramatic corrections that required years or decades to recover. These lessons emphasize the importance of valuation discipline and fundamental analysis. While Palantir remains a prominent player in AI and analytics, its inflated valuation, slowing growth, and reliance on speculative market trends suggest caution for investors. Analysts currently rate Palantir as a \u201cModerate Sell,\u201d highlighting the potential for significant losses despite its technological strengths and government connections.\n\n**TL;DR:** Palantir\u2019s extreme valuation, heavy reliance on government contracts, slowing growth, and overdependence on AI hype pose significant risks, particularly in a market increasingly favoring stable investments.\n\n**Sources:** Palantir, Palantir Blog, Yahoo Finance, SEC, Seeking Alpha\n\n",

        "selftext": "At first I wanna make clear, that I am invested and believe that most of the things discussed in this sub will come true and that this is a great company with a great product which has so much low hanging potential which will be unleashed.\n\nI am a long term investor and I am thinking about the next 2, 5 and 10 years. I have no problem with the volatility.\n\nThis is a question of valuation only.\n\nI want to zoom out and focus on the realiy and not possible future scenarios because nobody can see into the future and nothing is 100% sure.\n\nI made a lot of research to understand the stock company and all the potential, but there is one question which I couldn\\*t answer myself even tough I did some research on it. This question doesn\\*t seem to be discussed here at all.\n\nThe only discussion I saw was this one here, where everyone was against the OP and couldn\\*t really dissolve his concerns other then \"The future is great because of .....\" (which we all already know and which the market knows) :\u00a0[https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditIPO/comments/1j81q8o/time\\_to\\_shreddit\\_or\\_is\\_there\\_still\\_a\\_chance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditIPO/comments/1j81q8o/time_to_shreddit_or_is_there_still_a_chance/)\n\nIn this post he describes it well that only because a product and company and the future are great doesn\\*t always automaticly mean, that the stock has to go up. I always like to look at overall trends and history. And If I look at all these other social media companies which rely mostly on just ads and have seen high user growth in the past and had a hype are going now side ways. If you just did buy and hold you did make money but these haven\\*t been stocks where it just goes up in a straigth line. (can be very volatile, but with constant trend that its a winner stock) They mostly go sideways and have been staying on the same level for years now.\n\nWhat I mean with winner stock, for example IBKR. They have had a lot of volatility and a lot of downfalls. (If you look back and zoom out it just doesn\\*t look like this stock has fallen a lot during some periods)\n\nFor me it makes sense to invest more into Reddit if it will become a winner stock like this for example which has huge falls but the sucess is in a long term uptrend.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-will-rddt-not-become-the-next-pins-twtr-snap-or-other-v0-pvd2qkmoaqoe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D673bcaec6432c54e161ecde087594e450c5c3dfd](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-will-rddt-not-become-the-next-pins-twtr-snap-or-other-v0-pvd2qkmoaqoe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D673bcaec6432c54e161ecde087594e450c5c3dfd)\n\nAnd yea, I know Reddit is now also making 15% of its revenue with AI deals with Google and OpenAI. This is of course nice and great, but ads will still be the main revenue stream for the next 5 years. The Ai deals are overhyped. Most Ais just keep scraping it and there is almost nothing reddit can do to limit scraping. it will still be cheaper to just scrape it then to make a deal with Reddit unless you are a giant company like Google or ClosedAi chatgpt\n\nAnd yea, Onlyfans and Patreon paywall content has huge potential and will be great, but most users are still used to not pay for anything on the internet and will also not do so in the next years. Just look at\u00a0[https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/)\n\nBy the way, the\u00a0[r/Piracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/)\u00a0sub has been growing massivly over the past few months. Just recently cracked the 2 Mio subscriber and now already at 2.1 Mio users.\n\nTwitter (before Elon bought it)\n\nOf course you could earn lots of money with Twitter, but only with good timing. For example if you would have bought in 2014 at 45 or even 50, you practicly wouldn\\*t have made almost any money. It only went up in the last few years, because Elon bought it. Otherwise it would have stayed down there.\n\nEveryone always says \"Oh, it gotta be at least as much worth as Twitter which was 40 billions\" - But this was only worth that much because of the buyout which many said was way way overpriced. As you can see on this chart Twitter was mostly not worth 40 billions. So this argument sounds good but is lacking.\n\nTwitter has had comparable user amount to Reddit. (not exactly the same, but better then comparison with SNAP)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-will-rddt-not-become-the-next-pins-twtr-snap-or-other-v0-5mspqmdaypoe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D361c4358acffe3f7a2e600ac670da90f7cc61045](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-will-rddt-not-become-the-next-pins-twtr-snap-or-other-v0-5mspqmdaypoe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D361c4358acffe3f7a2e600ac670da90f7cc61045)\n\n\n\nIf I invest in something, then I don\\*t want to rely on insanely good timing of buying into and when to take profits. Maybe you buy in cheap but you see the trend of the ricing prises and think \"yea, the future looks great, the product is getting better, more users ...), but you don\\*t realize that the stock has become way too overvalued.\n\nBasicly all these Social media stocks crashed after Corona was over.\n\nSNAP\n\nIt\\*s a bad comparison because there is a logical reason why they can\\*t grow ad revenue as reddit can: The users mostly use it for chatting and you don\\*t want to have ads in your chat, otherwise you will just switch to whatsapp or instagram or whatever kids use these days.\n\n  \n[https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-will-rddt-not-become-the-next-pins-twtr-snap-or-other-v0-nrsv3p1b0qoe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dc7d95c419b8b5a4f0f8facbb80b48ae3754ce0ee](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-will-rddt-not-become-the-next-pins-twtr-snap-or-other-v0-nrsv3p1b0qoe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dc7d95c419b8b5a4f0f8facbb80b48ae3754ce0ee)\n\nPINS - Pinterest is more interesting and with old Twitter the better comparison because they are way more similar then Snapchat.\n\n  \n[https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-will-rddt-not-become-the-next-pins-twtr-snap-or-other-v0-kg3vqs0e4qoe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D029dc78abe37fa300f500309974a7cad8a62db26](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-will-rddt-not-become-the-next-pins-twtr-snap-or-other-v0-kg3vqs0e4qoe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D029dc78abe37fa300f500309974a7cad8a62db26)\n\n  \nPINS is now worth $21.66 B. ([https://companiesmarketcap.com/pinterest/marketcap/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/pinterest/marketcap/))\n\nRDDTs Marcet cap is now currently $23.19 B\u00a0[https://companiesmarketcap.com/reddit/marketcap/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/reddit/marketcap/)\n\nNow RDDT is attractive because it has way more users then PINS and in all the things which already have been discussed a lot way more potential then PINS. The valuation now seems attractive in a comparison. PINS is not in a hype at all, so it should be good for comparisons.\n\nI am not Expert with PINS. I asked several Chatbots to compare these two and what exactly went wrong with Pinterest.\n\nIt seems that since 2022 the users growh has been slowing down of the monthly active users. Sounds similar. This has been happening to Reddit recently and will always be a huge danger for shert term price also in the future because of too high growth expectations and hype.\n\nMore competition with Tiktok and Instagram for PINS.\n\nReddit is not directly competing as much with these platforms, so this shouldn\\*t be such a huge issue for RDDT. Reddit is more based on Text and like a Forum.\n\nPinterest is just pictures.\n\nThe new ad formats and ad tools which have been introduced by PINS hasn't found as much acceptance by the people who do ad campagnes.\n\nThe strategy of PINS now seems to be the integration with e commerce to directly buy the product. This already has been discussed in this sub here and will also be probably done by reddit in the future. (It\\*s not a priority according to the recent calls) This e commerce integration seems to take more time then expected.\n\n\"**Monetization Challenges**: Despite a substantial user base, Pinterest has struggled to effectively monetize its platform. The company's heavy reliance on advertising revenue makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in advertising spend, especially during economic downturns or shifts in marketing trends.\"\n\n\"**Pinterest**: As of January 2025, Pinterest's global monthly active users (MAUs) reached 537 million, marking an 11% year-over-year increase.\" - I have never know anyone who has ever used that platform, but okay.\n\nThe issue also seems to be that Pinterest hasn't been able to attract those big advertisers that constantly run ad campaigns. Reddit is starting to get more of those big names in and already has been sucessful in this (at least to my current knowledge).\n\nSummary of PINS: Similar problem - growth can slow down - more users doesn\\*t automaticly translate into more ad revenue per user - diffictulty to compete with big more advanced advertisers like META, Google, Tiktok, Insta.\n\nIf I would want to run an ad campaign I probably also would just go to google or Meta because these are know. I guess that most marketing people currently don\\*t see Reddit at the same level as an option to run their ads there, because of lacking features out of the perspective of someone who is used to the great suites of Google and Meta. (I am not an expert in this) This is also a chance for Reddit to copy the same things those big guys are doing to make it easier for people to advertise. This must also work about branding.\n\nIf you look at companies or organisations, in the last year everyone and their mother has created a tiktok account and started advertising there, because of the hype. Tiktok became a name that became so important, that even as an old person you couldn\\*t avoid it. Look at all these politicans posting weird tiktoks. Look at all these companies advertising there, because they hope to profit from the hype. Every institution or politican has a tiktok, insta, even X or nowadays bluesky account. Many even have Threads, but nobody has Reddit. Literally nobody. I know Reddit is a community and not a I follow this guy platform, but this is also a huge reason why not so many people advertise here compared to the big platforms.\n\n\\-Reddit has to also become a name you can\\*t avoid as an advertiser. I don\\*t know how we can get there. Maybe other platforms will get worse and thats why people start advertising more on Reddit for the community and the engagement, because it can be more specific.\n\nSo if we break it down to what can\\*t happen for the stock to suceed long term:\n\n\\-user growth slowing down\n\n\\-expected Revenue can't be delivered because more users doesn\\*t mean more revenue per user\n\n\\-competition with big ad brands (out of the perspective of an advertiser, not of the content platform itself for its users)\n\n\\-short term hypes (you buy in when its overvalued and it never ever goes back to this level again)\n\n\\-stock going sideways and staying on the same level as Pinterest\n\n!!

        "title": "Four Stocks to Watch After Trump\u2019s Critical Minerals Executive Order $MILIF $USAR $PPTA $UAMY",
        "selftext": "On\u00a0April 15, 2025, President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0signed an executive order that could reshape the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0mining sector. The order launches a federal investigation into the country\u2019s heavy reliance on foreign sources for processed critical minerals\u2014materials essential for everything from jet engines and missile systems to smartphones and electric vehicles.\n\nThe order comes amidst escalating tensions with\u00a0China, which recently halted exports of several key rare earth elements. Trump\u2019s move frames this dependency as a national security threat and calls for steps to rebuild and secure domestic supply chains.\n\nAs\u00a0Washington\u00a0pivots toward boosting\u00a0U.S.\u00a0production, certain mining and processing companies stand to benefit. Here are four to watch.\n\n**Military Metals Corp.\u00a0(OTCQB: MILIF)**:\n\nKicking off the list is\u00a0**Military Metals Corp.\u00a0(OTCQB: MILIF)**, a focused play on one of the lesser-known but increasingly vital critical minerals: antimony. As one of the few publicly traded companies dedicated almost entirely to antimony, MILIF is advancing multiple high-grade projects in politically stable jurisdictions, including the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0and the\u00a0European Union.\n\nEarlier this year, the company completed the acquisition of the 100%-owned Last Chance Antimony-Gold Property in\u00a0Nevada. This historic site once supported\u00a0U.S.\u00a0defense efforts in the early 20th century. Located just 18 kilometers from Kinross\u2019s\u00a0Round Mountain\u00a0mine, the property had seen little exploration since the 1980s. That is, until now. The company's team recently completed an initial site visit and is preparing for a full exploration program focused on antimony-rich quartz vein structures. Visible copper staining suggests potential for additional upside.\n\nInternationally,\u00a0**MILIF**\u00a0is also making progress in\u00a0Slovakia, where it controls two antimony-gold properties: Trojarov\u00e1 and Tiennesgrund. Trojarov\u00e1, the company\u2019s flagship asset in\u00a0Europe, has seen over 14,000 meters of drilling and hundreds of channel samples from Soviet-era exploration.\u00a0SLR Consulting (Canada)\u00a0is now digitizing and interpreting the data to develop a modern mineral resource estimate. A LIDAR survey of the 1.7-kilometer underground workings was completed in early April and will guide future drilling.\n\nTiennesgrund is set for fieldwork starting in May. The property includes historical adits that produced high-grade antimony\u2014reported at 18 to 24 percent\u2014along with early signs of tungsten mineralization. MILIF plans to integrate decades of archived Slovak government data with new sampling and soil surveys to identify new targets.\n\nAll of this is unfolding amid rising antimony prices, which recently reached all-time highs near\u00a0$60,000\u00a0per metric ton. Meanwhile, the White House\u2019s decision to exempt antimony from new tariffs signals its importance to\u00a0U.S.\u00a0national interests.\n\n**Military Metals Corp.**\u00a0has also applied to the\u00a0U.S. Defense Industrial Base Consortium, potentially opening doors for funding under the Defense Production Act\u2014an invaluable capital source for a junior company.\n\n\u201cThe exemption of these minerals from tariffs reinforces the urgent need to accelerate the development of secure, reliable supply chains,\u201d said CEO\u00a0Scott Eldridge. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear signal that advancing domestic and allied sources is essential.\u201d\n\nWith a focused commodity strategy, underexplored assets, and growing policy support across the\u00a0Atlantic,\u00a0**Military Metals Corp.\u00a0(OTCQB: MILIF)**\u00a0could be an early mover in the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0critical minerals market.\n\n**USA Rare Earth, Inc.\u00a0(Nasdaq: USAR)**\u00a0is strategically positioned at the heart of America\u2019s push for mineral independence. Directly aligned with President Trump\u2019s executive order, USAR is building one of the country\u2019s most comprehensive domestic supply chains for rare earth magnets\u2014vital components in everything from electric vehicles and defense systems to wind turbines and smartphones.\n\nThe company controls mining rights to the\u00a0Round Top\u00a0deposit in\u00a0West Texas, one of the largest known sources of heavy rare earth elements in the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0These include dysprosium and terbium\u2014critical for high-performance magnets\u2014as well as gallium, beryllium, and lithium\u2014materials flagged as \u201cstrategic\u201d by the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0government. In\u00a0Stillwater, Oklahoma, USAR is constructing a 310,000-square-foot facility to manufacture sintered neodymium magnets. These magnets are used in electric motors, defense applications, and advanced technologies. USAR has also commissioned an\u00a0Advanced Innovations Lab\u00a0at the site, where it will prototype custom magnet designs and develop proprietary processes to bring production online by 2026.\n\n\u201cOur magnet facility sits at the center of the Trump Administration\u2019s recent critical mineral executive order,\u201d said CEO\u00a0Joshua Ballard. \u201cWe\u2019re open for business.\u201d\n\nUSAR has strengthened its leadership team with the appointment of\u00a0Rob Steele\u00a0as Chief Financial Officer. With more than three decades of experience in finance and investment banking\u2014raising\u00a0$28 billion\u00a0across fast-growing industries\u2014Steele will play a key role in securing the capital needed for USAR\u2019s expansion. \u201cI strongly believe in USAR\u2019s mission of returning the rare earth mineral and magnet supply chain to America,\u201d Steele said.\n\nWith the escalating demand for high-tech manufacturing components and growing support from the federal government, USAR is well-positioned to become a key player in the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0critical minerals resurgence.\n\n**Perpetua Resources Corp.\u00a0(Nasdaq: PPTA) (TSX: PPTA)**\u00a0is emerging as a significant player in the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0effort to secure domestic sources of strategic minerals. Through its flagship\u00a0Stibnite Gold Project\u00a0in central\u00a0Idaho, the company is working to restore an abandoned mine site to produce both gold and the only mined source of antimony in the U.S.\u2014a mineral vital to national defense and clean energy technologies.\n\nThe Stibnite Project\u00a0is one of the highest-grade open-pit gold deposits in the country and is nearing a construction decision. The company recently secured a Final Record of Decision from the\u00a0U.S. Forest Service, completed basic engineering, and started procurement for long-lead infrastructure items. It has also received significant financial backing, including a Letter of Interest for up to\u00a0$1.8 billion\u00a0in financing from the\u00a0U.S. Export-Import Bank\u00a0and over\u00a0$70 million\u00a0in Defense Production Act funding.\n\nAntimony from Stibnite is considered essential by the\u00a0Department of Defense\u00a0for use in munitions and missile systems. With\u00a0China,\u00a0Russia, and\u00a0Tajikistan\u00a0currently controlling 90% of the global supply of mined antimony\u2014China recently banned all exports to the U.S.\u2014Perpetua\u2019s project could supply up to 35% of domestic demand during its first six years of production, directly countering foreign dominance in the supply chain.\n\nCEO\u00a0Jon Cherry\u00a0emphasized, \u201cThe Stibnite Gold Project is a prime example of why critical mineral production in America needs immediate attention.\u201d With strong partnerships in place, Perpetua is aligned with both economic development and environmental restoration, making it a compelling long-term opportunity.\n\n**United States Antimony Corporation\u00a0(NYSE: UAMY)**\u00a0is uniquely positioned to benefit from the growing push for domestic critical minerals production, particularly antimony. As one of the few vertically integrated antimony producers in the Western Hemisphere, UAMY is developing a full-cycle operation from mining to refining entirely within\u00a0North America.\n\nThe company operates facilities in both the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0and\u00a0Mexico, including its\u00a0Montana\u00a0base and the recently reactivated Madero smelter in\u00a0Coahuila, which processes antimony concentrate into finished trioxide. UAMY is also advancing exploration at its properties in\u00a0Alaska, where it controls nearly 9,000 acres of antimony and gold claims. Early sampling has revealed multiple high-grade surface targets, and fieldwork is already underway.\n\nIn 2023, UAMY grew revenue by 72% and tripled its gross profit while maintaining a clean balance sheet and increasing cash reserves to over\u00a0$18 million. With smelting infrastructure online and concentrate shipments either delivered or en route, UAMY is poised to scale production through 2025.\n\nStrategically, UAMY is part of several federal collaborations aimed at strengthening the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0supply chain for antimony-based materials\u2014critical for both ammunition and flame retardants. As\u00a0China\u00a0continues to restrict exports of key minerals, UAMY\u2019s importance is growing. With rising antimony prices and accelerating policy momentum, UAMY offers rare exposure to this strategically important critical mineral.\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/four-stocks-watch-after-trumps-critical-minerals-executive-order-2025-04-17](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/four-stocks-watch-after-trumps-critical-minerals-executive-order-2025-04-17)",

        "title": "As CoreWeave's (CRWV) Stock Value Flies - Shareholders Increasingly Turn to Nebius (NBIS) in Shifting AI Cloud Landscape",
        "selftext": "The AI infrastructure market is experiencing rapid shifts, and recent developments suggest a potential re-evaluation by investors, with some CoreWeave shareholders reportedly looking towards Nebius as a more compelling opportunity.\n\nWhile CoreWeave has seen significant stock surges and secured major deals, concerns about its profitability, customer concentration, and unique relationship with Nvidia appear to be prompting some investors to explore alternatives.\n\nCoreWeave, a prominent AI hyperscaler, has undeniably made headlines. Following its IPO in late March 2025 at $40 per share, the company's stock has seen a meteoric rise, at one point surging over 200%. This impressive performance has been fueled by substantial infrastructure agreements, including an $11.2 billion revenue backlog with OpenAI, and continued strong demand for its purpose-built AI platform. Nvidia, a key investor and partner, also recently disclosed a 7% stake in CoreWeave, further boosting investor confidence.\n\nHowever, a closer look reveals some underlying concerns that may be driving a shift in investor sentiment. Analysts have highlighted CoreWeave's reliance on a limited number of customers, with Microsoft alone accounting for approximately 72% of its revenue in Q1 2025. This customer concentration presents a significant risk, particularly as hyperscalers like Microsoft and Google continue to build out their own AI infrastructure. Furthermore, despite its high revenue growth, CoreWeave reported a net loss of $314.6 million in Q1 2025, raising questions about its path to profitability. The company is also heavily burdened by debt, with some estimates suggesting interest payments could balloon to over $2 billion annually.\n\nEnter Nebius, a rising force in the AI cloud space. Nebius has swiftly positioned itself as a serious contender, focusing on building a global footprint with data centers in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Like CoreWeave, Nebius also boasts a strong partnership with Nvidia, being a launch partner for NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform.\n\nWhat makes Nebius particularly attractive to some investors is its strategic approach to growth and financing. In December 2024, Nebius secured $700 million in equity funding from investors including Accel and Nvidia, followed by a recent $1 billion debt financing round in June 2025. The company's unique financial position, leveraging ownership and equity stakes in non-core businesses like Toloka and ClickHouse, allows it to fund its aggressive expansion plans for its core AI infrastructure business. Nebius has also been actively expanding its data center capacity, recently adding three new regions, including a strategic data center in Israel.\n\nWhile both CoreWeave and Nebius are aggressively scaling to meet the surging demand for AI infrastructure, Nebius appears to be gaining traction due to its diversified funding strategy, expanding global reach, and potentially more stable long-term outlook. As the AI cloud market continues to evolve, the ability to rapidly deploy capacity, diversify customer bases, and maintain a sound financial footing will be crucial for sustained success. The reported pivot of some CoreWeave shareholders towards Nebius underscores a growing recognition among investors that while immediate growth is appealing, sustainable profitability and strategic diversification are paramount in this fiercely competitive sector.",

        "selftext": "I bought some FAN (wind) and TAN (solar) back in 2021, hopeful that energy stocks would do well because of growing environmental concerns and attempts to shift away from reliance on fossil fuels. Unfortunately, they\u2019ve not been doing well at all. FAN has dropped over 20% since I bought it, and TAN has dropped over 50%. They\u2019re pretty much the only stocks I own that have given me a long term loss \n\nWoke up today to a Trump victory and both stocks dropping by over 5% despite the rest of the market rallying. I know in part that might be due to people selling yesterday in anticipation of a possible Trump victory (I know I was thinking of selling yesterday, but the market closed before I made a decision), but I\u2019m curious what people think about the more long term performance of green energy stocks?\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking of selling for a while, but so far I\u2019ve convinced myself that the stocks are probably going down now because of high initial production prices, but that they\u2019ll probably go up again in the future. However, I\u2019m skeptical of them doing well under a Trump presidency, at least compared to a Harris presidency, considering how little priority Trump gives to environmental causes and renewable energy. Also the fact that a lot of solar panels come from China with high tariffs\n\nAny thoughts on this?",

Yet the horizon is shaping up to suggest decreased reliance on just-in-time supply chains and decreased opportunities to export American grain harvests.  For both practical and traditional reasons, one way to create a store of value from surplus grain is to produce distilled spirits.  Because some vintages accumulate value over time and all of them feature extremely low rates of spoilage, booze is a fine way to occupy a warehouse.\n\nThus my question to the group is about new and/or growing distillery operations.  Is this predictable economic change likely to drive the rise of many new local businesses?  Might it instead be absorbed by industrial producers like BUD and ADM?  As spring rains wash over the cornfields in my county, I know a strong harvest is on a collision course for a shortage of storage space in grain elevators.  I'm not even a proper capitalist, yet I can't help but wonder how this inevitable tension will resolve.",

        "title": "Nvidia: Rising Competition, Valuation Concerns, and Shifting AI Investments",
        "selftext": "* Nvidia peaked in June 2024 and has been in a sideways correction.\n* DeepSeek's AI model and high Nvidia valuation caused a sharp stock decline.\n* Cloud companies' weak performance reduced AI chip investments.\n* AMD and tech giants are developing cheaper AI chips, pressuring Nvidia.\n* Nvidia remains dominant but faces increasing competition and valuation concerns.\n\n\n\nIn January 2025, Chinese AI company DeepSeek made a bold move by launching a new AI model at a fraction of the cost typically required. This raised concerns about Nvidia\u2019s market monopoly, leading to a historic one-day market cap loss of nearly $600 billion. The stock had already been struggling after peaking in June 2024, showing signs of a broader correction phase. Weak cloud profits and reduced AI hardware investments from major cloud companies added to the downturn. Despite Nvidia consistently beating earnings estimates, its high valuation has investors questioning its long-term sustainability. The company\u2019s $2.8 trillion valuation, trading at 12.5x forward revenue for FY 2027, has been flagged as a major risk.\n\nNvidia\u2019s latest earnings exceeded analyst expectations, beating EPS estimates by $0.04 and revenue estimates by $1.19 billion. Annual EPS growth remains strong, but the stock failed to rally due to external market conditions. Major hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft underperformed in cloud revenue, signaling a slowdown in AI chip investments. Investors are concerned about weakening demand as new competitors introduce cheaper AI models. Nvidia forecasts a 56% YoY revenue increase for FY 2026 and 21% for FY 2027, yet risks remain as the AI chip market becomes more competitive.\n\nAmazon, Microsoft, and Google account for nearly half of Nvidia\u2019s data center sales. Their investments in Nvidia\u2019s AI chips have powered cloud AI workloads, but recent underperformance in cloud revenue is forcing them to reconsider expensive AI hardware spending. Companies are increasingly looking for alternatives to Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, such as in-house chips and more affordable AI models. AI training, which once required millions of dollars in Nvidia GPUs, can now be done for as little as $50 using new techniques. Alibaba\u2019s latest AI model has surpassed DeepSeek, challenging Nvidia\u2019s dominance. With cloud growth slowing, hyperscalers are cutting back, further threatening Nvidia\u2019s future revenue.\n\nCompetition in the AI hardware space is intensifying as more companies shift away from Nvidia\u2019s expensive GPUs. DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model is now available on AWS and Azure, gaining rapid adoption due to its low cost. Alibaba\u2019s Qwen2.5-Max is reportedly more advanced, further pressuring Nvidia. Research from Stanford and the University of Washington has demonstrated that powerful AI models can be trained for just $50, proving that high-end GPUs are no longer necessary. Major tech firms like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are investing in custom AI chips, reducing reliance on Nvidia and reshaping the market.\n\nAMD is rapidly expanding its AI chip business, positioning itself as a strong competitor. CEO Lisa Su expects tens of billions in AI chip revenue annually, and the company is accelerating the launch of its Instinct MI350 to compete with Nvidia\u2019s flagship chips. Other companies, including OpenAI, Google, and Amazon, are developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. These alternatives are proving to be more efficient and cost-effective, which could threaten Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its premium pricing and dominant market position.\n\nWall Street remains skeptical about Nvidia\u2019s valuation. The stock is trading at 12.5x forward revenue for FY 2027, with a high forward P/E ratio of 25x FY 2026 EPS estimates. Comparatively, Alphabet trades at 18.5x forward P/E, making Nvidia look significantly more expensive. With Amazon, Google, and Microsoft seeing weaker cloud revenue growth, Wall Street is pushing them to cut capital expenditures. If hyperscalers reduce AI chip purchases, Nvidia\u2019s revenue projections may be revised downward, increasing concerns about the sustainability of its high valuation.\n\nThe future of Nvidia\u2019s stock price remains uncertain. A prolonged correction could continue as the AI market undergoes structural changes. The company faces mounting competition from AMD, DeepSeek, and custom AI chips, which could erode its market share. If hyperscalers continue to scale back on AI hardware spending, Nvidia\u2019s revenue growth could take a hit. Stock valuation comparisons highlight potential downside risks, with Nvidia trading at 12.3x forward revenue for FY 2027. Forecasts for Nvidia\u2019s revenue range from $179 billion to $334 billion, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the company\u2019s growth potential. While Nvidia remains a dominant force, the increasing number of competitors and shifting industry trends suggest that its upside may be limited.\n\nFinancial data reinforces Nvidia\u2019s strong market presence, with a 78% YoY revenue growth in Q4, reaching $39.3 billion, driven by a 93% increase in data center revenue. Analysts estimate Nvidia\u2019s forward revenue between $179 billion and $334 billion, reflecting its market strength. However, Nvidia\u2019s high forward P/E ratio of 40\u201350x, compared to Alphabet\u2019s 20\u201325x, indicates stretched valuations that may not be sustainable. Despite its leadership in AI chips, the emergence of alternatives is forcing Nvidia to adapt or risk losing ground.\n\nBroader industry trends indicate a shift in AI and semiconductor investments. Hyperscalers are prioritizing efficiency over Nvidia\u2019s expensive GPUs, turning to cost-effective AI models from DeepSeek, Alibaba, and academic institutions. Geopolitical factors may also impact Nvidia\u2019s supply chain and stock price. Market performance suggests a shift in investor sentiment, with Microsoft\u2019s stock down 20% from its peak despite the S&P 500 rising 10%. The AI sector is evolving, and Nvidia\u2019s dominance, built on CUDA, faces growing competition from rising alternatives.\n\n**TL;DR:** Nvidia\u2019s stock has struggled since peaking in June 2024 due to rising competition from DeepSeek and AMD, reduced cloud investments, and concerns over high valuation. Despite strong earnings, Wall Street remains skeptical about its long-term growth. AI hardware spending is shifting towards cost-effective solutions, putting pressure on Nvidia\u2019s pricing power. While the company remains dominant, increasing competition and hyperscaler cutbacks could limit its upside potential.\n\n",

        "title": "SoundHound: AI Hype Can\u2019t Mask Weak Fundamentals",
        "selftext": "**Summary:**\n\n* SoundHound's stock price has surged due to the Amelia acquisition, but organic growth remains weak, and losses are substantial.\n* The company operates in highly fragmented markets with growing competition, making substantial profits unlikely.\n* The current extreme valuation seems unsustainable given poor fundamentals, though AI hype and growth via acquisitions may delay a correction.\n\nSoundHound\u2019s (NASDAQ: SOUN) stock has seen a dramatic pullback recently after an earlier surge driven by the acquisition of Amelia. While the acquisition has bolstered headline growth figures, SoundHound continues to face challenges in generating organic growth, and its financial losses remain significant. The company\u2019s previous acquisitions have drawn attention to its underlying weaknesses, with critics pointing out that inorganic growth has been used to offset disappointing performance in core operations. Although the stock price has risen by over 200% since earlier criticism, the fundamentals offer little support for its current valuation.\n\nMarket enthusiasm for AI and speculative growth potential may continue to buoy the stock in the short term. However, achieving the level of growth required to justify the current valuation will be extremely challenging for SoundHound. The company's reliance on acquisitions suggests that organic scalability remains elusive, and its size makes future acquisitions less impactful.\n\nSoundHound has made strides in developing its technology, particularly through Polaris, a multimodal foundation model trained on billions of conversations and millions of hours of audio. This model promises greater accuracy and lower hosting costs, which SoundHound has been gradually rolling out across its customer base. Polaris currently powers a third of SoundHound's AI interactions with restaurant customers, with plans to expand this coverage further. Additional advancements, such as reducing hallucinations and improving performance in noisy environments like vehicles, are also being pursued. However, given the company\u2019s two-decade history, it is unclear if technological limitations have been the primary factor hindering its growth.\n\nThe automotive segment, one of SoundHound\u2019s primary markets, has shown limited success despite the company\u2019s long-standing presence. LLMs have enabled significant improvements in voice AI, but questions remain about whether voice interfaces will achieve widespread adoption or remain a niche feature. Vehicles represent one scenario where voice AI offers clear advantages, but even this market faces challenges. The anticipated rollout of advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving features may reduce the need for voice AI in vehicles, limiting its potential market.\n\nWhile SoundHound has reported some traction in the automotive industry, including deals with four EV OEMs and growth in markets like the Middle East, China, and India, its overall impact remains modest. Automotive revenue is estimated to be below $40 million annually, and the company continues to rely heavily on its relationship with Stellantis. Recent milestones, such as the integration of Chat AI into vehicles from brands like Alfa Romeo and Citroen, have yielded encouraging results, including increased usage and higher customer satisfaction scores. However, the scale of these achievements falls short of establishing SoundHound as a major player in the automotive sector.\n\nThe company\u2019s pivot toward voice AI solutions for restaurants highlights its challenges in the automotive market. Acquisitions of Synq3 and Amelia have fueled growth in this segment, with SoundHound targeting a $1 billion revenue opportunity in drive-thru solutions. However, the reliance on acquisitions raises questions about the product\u2019s market fit and competitive positioning. SoundHound has secured partnerships with a wide range of restaurant chains, including Panda Express, Church\u2019s Texas Chicken, and White Castle. The company has also surpassed 100 million phone-ordering interactions, recently adding Torchy\u2019s Tacos and a top-ten global pizza brand to its portfolio. While voice AI offers value in scenarios like drive-thru ordering, the broader adoption of touchscreens and mobile apps may limit its growth potential. Moreover, the restaurant AI market remains fragmented, with competitors like IBM, Google, and Microsoft pursuing similar opportunities.\n\nDespite SoundHound\u2019s claims of superior accuracy, metrics in this space are not standardized, making it difficult to assess the company\u2019s relative performance. Various competitors have reported impressive results, such as Wendy\u2019s FreshAI achieving an 86% success rate for fully automated orders during pilot tests. Smaller players like Hi Auto and Valyant AI have also gained traction, highlighting the competitive and fragmented nature of the market.\n\nFinancially, SoundHound\u2019s revenue rose 89% year-over-year in the third quarter to $25 million, but this growth was primarily driven by acquisitions. Organic growth appears to have declined by roughly 50%, as prior-year figures included one-off revenue from a major automotive customer. The company has forecasted revenue of $82\u201385 million for 2024 and $155\u2013175 million for 2025, suggesting minimal growth for its core business in the near future.\n\nProfit margins have also been a challenge. Gross margins fell to 49% in the third quarter due to acquisition costs, though non-GAAP gross margins were reported at 60%. Longer-term, the company aims for gross margins of 70% or higher and EBITDA margins above 30%. However, these targets remain far from reach. SoundHound expects to achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2025, though this metric excludes significant expenses such as stock-based compensation and depreciation.\n\nSoundHound ended the third quarter with $136 million in cash and equivalents, along with $39 million in debt carrying a 15% annual cost. Management has hinted at the possibility of raising equity to reduce debt, but this would have a limited impact given the company\u2019s current market capitalization.\n\nLooking ahead, SoundHound\u2019s revenue is projected to reach $275\u2013325 million by 2029. At its current valuation, this implies a 30x forward revenue multiple\u2014significantly higher than historical norms, even during speculative market conditions. By comparison, valuations during the peak of the SaaS boom typically ranged around 15x forward revenue. As a result, SoundHound\u2019s stock price is likely to decline significantly unless the company can deliver extraordinary performance in the coming years.\n\nSoundHound operates in a competitive, fragmented market and lacks clear competitive advantages. While its technology has shown promise, the broader market dynamics and the company\u2019s poor financial fundamentals make its current valuation difficult to justify. Based on these factors, SoundHound\u2019s stock is likely overvalued and could settle closer to $5 per share as market sentiment realigns with reality.\n\n**TL;DR:** SoundHound has seen a surge in its stock price, driven by acquisitions and AI hype, but its fundamentals are weak, and organic growth is negative. With increasing competition in fragmented markets and a reliance on inorganic growth, the company\u2019s current valuation appears unsustainable. A significant stock price correction seems likely.\n\n",

Here's why I believe this sector is massively underappreciated and why it makes up the core of my strategy:\n\n1. Explosive Data Growth Needs Real Infrastructure\nAI, cloud computing, 5G, smart cities, and quantum computing all depend on ultra-fast, low-latency data transmission. Fiber is the backbone that powers it all, and demand is only accelerating.\n\n2. Global Upgrade Cycle is Underway\nMuch of the world still runs on outdated copper infrastructure. From the U.S. to emerging markets, we\u2019re seeing a global shift toward fiber-based connectivity, supported by both public and private capital.\n\n3. Geopolitical Tailwinds & National Security\nFiber infrastructure is now a matter of national interest. Western governments are investing billions to build secure, domestic data routes and reduce reliance on foreign tech.\n\n4. Physical Layer of the AI Boom\nWhile many are focused on AI software and semiconductors (NVIDIA, etc.), I\u2019m targeting the physical layer\u2014what all AI traffic runs on. Fiber networks, switches, optics, and routers are essential.\n\n5. Diversified but Targeted Exposure\nHere\u2019s how I\u2019m structuring it:\n\nCore Fiber/Optics Holdings: CIEN, GLW, NOK, CSCO, ADTN, LITE, JNPR\n\nEdge & Cloud Security: CRWD, PLTR\n\nDefense & Infrastructure: LMT, KTOS, ESLT\n\nEmerging Market Exposure: EIDO (Indonesia), INDA (India), EWW (Mexico)\n\nFuture-Tech Speculatives: IONQ, RGTI\n\nEnergy, Semis, and Other Anchors: XOM, NVDA, QCOM, CCJ, BHP\n\n\nI\u2019ve structured monthly allocations based on conviction level while keeping exposure balanced across sectors that support the fiber and data ecosystem.\n\nWould love to hear thoughts\u2014especially from others with long-term infrastructure or data-driven theses.

In the five years since the 1996 bill became law [Telecommunications Act of 1996], telecommunications companies poured more than $500 billion into laying fiber optic cable, adding new switches, and building wireless networks. So much long-distance capacity was added in North America, for example, that no more than two percent is currently being used. With the fixed costs of these new networks so high and the marginal costs of sending signals over them so low, it is not a surprise that competition has forced prices down to the point where many firms have lost the ability to service their debts.

        "selftext": "Summary:\n\n* **Global Leadership in AI Chips:** TSMC dominates the semiconductor market, producing over 90% of the globe\u2019s most advanced chips, crucial for AI and HPC applications.\n* **Geopolitical Risks:** Taiwan\u2019s political tensions with China and U.S. export restrictions could affect TSMC, but its Arizona expansion helps mitigate risks.\n* **Strong Market Position:** Partnerships with Nvidia, Apple, and AMD highlight TSMC\u2019s technological edge, particularly with 3nm and 5nm nodes.\n* **Investment Potential:** Despite challenges, TSMC's 2025 focus on AI growth, HPC revenue, and strategic diversification underscores its value as a long-term investment.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the global leader in advanced chip manufacturing, powering the AI revolution with its cutting-edge technology. As the primary supplier for tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and AMD, TSMC produces over 90% of the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors, which are essential across industries, from military systems to consumer electronics. The company\u2019s dominance is driven by its consistent investment in leading-edge processes, including 3nm and 5nm nodes, which form the backbone of high-performance computing and AI applications.\n\nHowever, TSMC faces significant geopolitical risks due to its concentration in Taiwan, a region under constant tension with China, which views Taiwan as a breakaway province. A disruption in TSMC\u2019s operations could spark a global semiconductor crisis, impacting economies worldwide. To mitigate these risks, TSMC has been diversifying its production capabilities, with a notable $40 billion investment in its Arizona facility. This expansion strengthens supply chain resilience and ensures U.S. access to cutting-edge chips for AI, defense, and other critical technologies. Additionally, the U.S. CHIPs Act offsets the high operational costs of U.S.-based facilities and supports workforce development.\n\nTSMC\u2019s position as the backbone of the AI and HPC sectors is underscored by its strategic collaboration with Nvidia to produce advanced AI chips, such as the Blackwell series, further cementing its role as a critical supplier in this rapidly growing market. In Q3 2024, TSMC\u2019s revenue grew by 36% year-over-year, driven by strong AI-related demand, and it projects that mid-50% of its total revenue will come from HPC applications in 2025.\n\nDespite its strengths, TSMC must navigate industry challenges, including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market, declining PC and smartphone demand, and Wall Street's caution over potential growth slowdowns. Innovations in AI-driven consumer technologies and CES product launches could help revitalize these segments, with TSMC\u2019s advanced chipmaking capabilities playing a central role.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, TSMC\u2019s forward P/E ratio of 22.81 and PEG ratio of 0.73 suggest that while the stock trades at a premium, it remains reasonable given the company\u2019s earnings growth and leadership in the AI sector. Geopolitical risks, while significant, are partially mitigated by the company\u2019s diversification and reduced reliance on China, which now accounts for only 10% of its revenue.\n\nTSMC has outperformed the semiconductor market benchmark (SMH) due to its advanced technology and strategic partnerships, recovering more quickly from market selloffs and demonstrating strong resilience. The company\u2019s ability to balance geopolitical risks, invest in cutting-edge technologies, and sustain high demand for its products positions it as an attractive long-term investment.\n\nIn conclusion, TSMC\u2019s leadership in semiconductor innovation and its critical role in AI chipmaking make it indispensable to the global technology industry. While challenges remain, its proactive approach to diversification and its focus on high-growth sectors like AI and HPC ensure its continued success and solidify its appeal as an investment in 2025.\n\nTLDR: TSMC is a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, pivotal for AI chipmaking with unmatched technological dominance. While geopolitical risks and U.S.-China tensions pose challenges, the company\u2019s strategic expansions, such as its Arizona facilities, and its robust growth in AI-driven markets make it a compelling investment in 2025.\n\n",

Bondholders, on the other hand, are protected with senior claims and hedged positions.\n\nI\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts:\n\n1.

The videos you link are an excellent watch (maybe use 1.5x speed).\n\n**If you believe in BTC, buy BTC.** (for every dollar in MSTR only ~30% is converted into BTC, but if you directly invest in BTC (or IBIT) 100% is converted). Stay away from MSTR, since it is valued more than their BTC holdings and have no other way to create meaningful value.\n\nIt may be true that Saylor gives BTC exposure to institutions, which were not able to get that exposure before. However, I find Mark's explanation more likely: institutions don't care about whether BTC goes up or down. They only care about volatility since that's how they make money.\n\nMany people are uninformed/misled and the market is polarized (either FOMO or convinced of MSTR being overvalued), so the hype/volatility can remain for a while.\n\nLoans don't have to be paid back yet and have 0% coupon, so MSTR won't be in trouble for a while. If BTC goes up in short run, so will MSTR. Which may lead to debt converting to equity. If volatility is still present at that point, institutions will provide new debt and cycle continues.\n\nWhen loans expire and BTC is lower, then MSTR might have a problem. They might need to sell BTC to repay the debt, which will decrease the BTC price even further. This will in turn decrease MSTR price.\n\nDebt is senior to equity, so if BTC holdings don't cover the debt, shareholders might be left with empty hands.",

        "title": "Skechers: Analyzing Risks, Tariffs & Growth Prospects",
        "selftext": "Skechers, trading at a low P/E of 15.89 after a 12% pullback, remains an attractive investment despite macroeconomic challenges and tariff pressures. Anticipated international growth and a strong market position support its outlook, with projected revenue growth of 8.1% to 9.2% for 2025, although concerns over pricing and competition persist.\n\n# Macro Overview:\n\n# Tariff Impacts On The Footwear Industry\n\nNew tariffs on footwear have greatly affected the industry. This is especially true for those originating from China. President Trump plans to\u00a0[implement a 10% additional tariff](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china/)\u00a0on imports from China. This will likely increase the cost of goods, especially for the footwear industry. The typical sneaker already has around a 20% tariff on it, including a 7.5% tariff during Trump\u2019s last term. Implementing an extra 10% tariff could raise sneaker prices by about $18 to $20 for a mid-range shoe. This is according to a\u00a0[recent NBC News article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/economics/lip-balm-sneakers-trumps-china-tariffs-raise-prices-rcna190632).\n\nMany U.S. footwear brands including Skechers, manufacturer a large portion of their products in China to reduce labor costs. The increase in costs is typically passed on to the consumer which has a possibility of deterring increased sales. This could impact the cost of goods sold significantly. It could also affect gross margins and future growth among many other metrics. While Skechers is known for its value-oriented pricing, tariffs will pressure the company to raises prices.\n\n# Supply Chain Cost Pressures\n\nThe footwear industry relies heavily on global supply chains. This reliance makes it vulnerable to disruptions that impact production, transportation, and overall costs. Potential future disruptions like rising costs, and geopolitical risks have created headwinds for major footwear brands. In particular,\u00a0[China produced more than half](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/shoe-production-by-country)\u00a0of the footwear worn worldwide. With China\u2019s dominance in manufacturing, many companies have heavily relied on them with limited diversification elsewhere.\n\n# Investment Thesis:\n\nA recent 12% pullback in Skechers stock presents an intriguing opportunity for a company that hit record sales. Analysts have called Skechers 2025 outlook \u201cdisappointing.\u201d They are particularly concerned about\u00a0[CEO John Vandemore\u2019s comments\u00a0](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/skechers-stock-tumbles-weak-outlook-130419624.html)about how the company faces several headwinds and uncertainties. These include exchange rates and continuing macroeconomic weakness in China. Despite potential disruptions, Skechers released guidance for 2025 with sales projected to be between $9.7 and $9.8 billion, growth of 8.1% to 9.2%. While major competitors like Nike have struggled in recent years, Skechers has continued to increase their market share.\n\n* **Strong Brand Positioning:**\u00a0Skechers has effectively positioned itself as a mid-tier brand offering high-quality products at affordable price points. This has helped to distinguish themselves from premium players like Nike and Adidas while outperforming lower-end competitors. As the industries third-largest competitor by sales, Skechers markets their products ironically completely opposite of their rivals. Instead of producing the trendiest products or highest desired items, Skechers focuses on retirees and children with lower costs items. With almost 5,300 stores worldwide, Skechers caters to a wide variety of customers without reliance on any single demographic.\n* **International & Domestic Growth:**\u00a0Skechers largest growth segment is the international market accounting for 61.9% of sales. Ongoing store expansions have led to a total international store count of 1,177. There are plans to open 180 to 200 new company-owned stores worldwide. While the international market accounts for the vast majority of sales, domestic sales have kept the same pace growing 12.1%, the same as international. The Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA) segment continues to show impressive outperformance with growth of 21.4%. While China sales were the only sales segment to decline year over year to just -0.85%, Skechers has expanded heavily in China where they are the third-largest footwear brand behind only Nike and Adidas.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTariff concerns are warranted but we believe they are largely overblown for Skechers. A main concern stems from growth appearing to show signs of weakness due to the future forecast issued by management. Predicting foreign exchange rates is difficult. These rates play an important factor due to Skechers\u2019 large international market presence. Additionally, the rapid changes in policies by the current administration contribute to uncertainty.\n\n# Risk Factors:\n\n* **Inflation & Consumer Discretionary Slowdown:**\u00a0Skechers operates in the mid-tier footwear market. This means it caters to a more value-conscious consumer than Nike & Adidas. Persistent or increased inflation and high interest rates could force consumers to cut back on discretionary purchased including footwear. Inflation has led to higher production costs like raw materials, labor and freight. With tariffs playing an integral role, Skechers may be forced to pass added costs onto consumers with the potential to hurt sales.\n* **Foreign Exchange Volatility:**\u00a0Management has noted their concern about uncertainty in higher foreign exchange rates. There is also unpredictability about further increases. The company\u2019s outlook for fiscal 2025 does not include the potential impact of tariffs which may significantly impact growth. A stronger U.S. dollar negatively affects revenue from international markets. This is particularly true for Europe, China, and Latin America. All of these are important markets for Skechers.\n\n*\\*I do NOT own shares in Skechers at this time*",

        "title": "Crypto and Blockchain! Does it earn a place in your portfolio?",
        "selftext": "Blockchain technology has been a significant focus of media and public discourse. Some view it as a revolutionary advancement with transformative potential, while others associate it with speculation and opportunism. Regardless of these perspectives, blockchain technology is more than just a speculative tool for investors; it has a variety of applications that could reshape industries. To fully appreciate this technology, it\u2019s crucial to understand how it works and the scope of its capabilities.\n\nA blockchain is essentially a digital ledger that records transactions in a decentralized manner. Unlike traditional ledgers controlled by a single authority, a blockchain is distributed across a network of participants. This decentralization ensures transparency, as all users can view the ledger, and consensus mechanisms allow the network to agree on its true state without requiring a central authority.\n\nOne widely used method for concensus is called Proof of Work (PoW), where miners solve complex computational problems to validate transactions. This process ensures the security of the blockchain by requiring the agreement of more than 50% of miners to determine the legitimate version of the ledger. Miners are incentivized through rewards in cryptocurrency and transaction fees.\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism designed to address the high energy consumption of Proof of Work (PoW). Instead of miners solving computational problems, PoS relies on validators who \u201cstake\u201d their cryptocurrency as collateral to secure the network and validate transactions. Similarly, stakers get rewarded in fees and in the newly issued crypto asset. \n\nAnother critical feature of blockchains, particularly Ethereum, is smart contracts. These self executing contracts encode agreements directly into code, ensuring automatic execution when predefined conditions are met. Smart contracts enable applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) and provide benefits such as increased transparency, reduced reliance on intermediaries, and automation. Behind each transaction, a gas token is a prerequisite to compensate validators. Think of this as the lubricant allowing the blockchain to operate smoothly, otherwise people could spam transactions and contest the network. \n\nPotential Applications of Blockchain Technology\n\n1.Financial Services:\n\nBlockchain enables low-cost, fast, and secure cross-border payments, requiring only a recipient\u2019s public address.\nSmart contracts facilitate decentralized financial applications, allowing users to lend, borrow, and earn interest without banks.\nDeFi can expand financial access for the unbanked and underbanked, offering opportunities that traditional banking systems may not.\n\n2.Supply Chain Management:\n\nBlockchain can track real-world objects using tokens, improving supply chain transparency. Tokens can record timestamps, receipts, and provenance, addressing traceability issues in global logistics.\n\n3.Digital Assets and NFTs:\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique, indivisible tokens with diverse applications beyond digital art, such as supply chain tracking, media rights, and digital receipts.\n4.Other Uses:\nBlockchain technology supports secure voting systems, intellectual property management, and efficient healthcare recordkeeping.\n\nChallenges and Misconceptions\n\n1.Association with Scams:\nWhile blockchain\u2019s decentralized nature empowers innovation, it also enables malicious actors to create fraudulent tokens and applications. Users must exercise due diligence to ensure the legitimacy of the platforms they interact with.\n\t\n2.Environmental Concerns:\nPoW-based blockchains like Bitcoin are often criticized for their high energy consumption. However, miners frequently utilize renewable energy sources due to cost advantages. Studies suggest that over half of PoW mining operations incorporate green energy.\n\n3.Misunderstanding NFTs:\nNFTs are often mischaracterized as solely representing digital artwork. In reality, they serve broader purposes, including representing real-world assets, enabling supply chain tracking, and verifying ownership of digital and physical goods.\n\nPros and Limitations of Blockchain\n\nPros:\nTransparency: Publicly accessible ledgers ensure trust and reduce corruption.\nDecentralization: Eliminates reliance on central authorities, increasing security and resilience.\nOwnership: Blockchains empower individuals to own and take control of their own data rather than hand it over to intermediaries.\n\nLimitations:\nScalability: Many blockchains face limitations in processing a high volume of transactions quickly.\n\nEnergy Consumption: PoW mechanisms consume significant energy, raising sustainability concerns.\n\nRegulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide continue to debate how to regulate blockchain and its applications.\n\nSpeculation: While the various applications of blockchain seem promising, blockchains aren\u2019t being used in many practical ways currently, and it is debatable on whether or not blockchain technology is capable of complementing or replacing existing technologies in any meaningful way.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nIn the spirit of \u201cowning the market\u201d, I hold a small Crypto allocation, mainly in Ethereum. Proof of stake crypto currencies actually return fees to \u201cstakers\u201d. This is not too dissimilar to equities, where equity holders have a claim to the cash flows of a business. Ethereum is also a prerequisite to interact with any of the protocols or applications or tokens built on its network, thus there is demand for Ether beyond pure speculation. \n\nOther crypto assets, like Bitcoin, do not produce or really do anything, making it a subpar asset to hold til perpetuity. Its value is entirely extrinsic. \n\nStill, a healthy dose of skepticism is required. It\u2019s not entirely clear to me, and many others, that this technology will meaningfully be implemented. ",

        "title": "Yeti is undervalued despite tariff concerns",
        "selftext": "Here's my Investment breakdown on Yeti's future and the key points applicable. Let me know what you all think\n\n**Macro Overview:**\n\n* **Macroeconomic Challenges and Tariff Risks:**\u00a0There is much uncertainty about potential tariff increases on Chinese manufacturing goods. Yeti relies on Chinese production, which could impact profit margins if increased tariffs become a reality. This situation may require Yeti to enact price increases for consumers In response, to offset costs. Yeti is actively diversifying its supply chain, aiming to reduce its dependence on China.\n* **Competitive Landscape**\u00a0Yeti operates in a fiercely competitive market. Major competitors include brands like\u00a0Stanley,\u00a0Hydro Flask,\u00a0RTIC Outdoors,\u00a0S'Well and\u00a0CamelBak. Macroeconomic conditions could intensify competition as consumers seek value-oriented options with pricing being of the utmost importance. If tariff threats become reality, costs will increase for consumers. This change will instantly impact how consumers are willing to spend.\n* **Economic Downturn and Consumer Spending:**\u00a0Yeti is heavily dependent on discretionary consumer spending.\u00a0Economic slowdowns or recessions\u00a0would reduce demand for its high-end products, like coolers and drinkware. Inflationary pressures and rising interest rates in 2025 may continue to squeeze disposable income.\n\n**Thesis:**\n\n* **Strategic Acquisitions:**\u00a0Yeti acquired two separate companies in 2024.\u00a0Mystery Ranch\u00a0is one of them. It designs and manufactures durable load-bearing backpacks, bags, and pack accessories. The acquisition was valued at approximately $36.2 million funded via cash on hand. The second company is\u00a0Butter Pat Industries, a company that specializes in premium cast iron cookware. This acquisition cost approximately $48.5 million aimed to enhance Yeti\u2019s capabilities in the cookware category. Both acquisitions helped to fuel ambitious new categories in which Yeti released new products or further enhancements in. Yeti has shown they are willing to spend cash on hand for extra growth. They can choose to do so again in the future with a large cash position over $280 million.\n* **Strong Balance Sheet and Financial Health:**\u00a0Yeti\u2019s balance sheet remains strong. There is a 10% increase in assets and a decrease in long-term debt. The company maintains a high cash-to-debt ratio of 3.55. The company\u2019s low debt load, coupled with a significant cash reserve, supports strategic opportunities. These include acquisitions and share buybacks. This financial strategy reinforces Yeti\u2019s stable financial position. It enhances the company\u2019s ability to weather economic uncertainties.\n* **DTC & Retail Growth**: Yeti has experienced significant growth in its direct-to-consumer approach. In all three quarters of 2024 Yeti has seen growth with 8.2% in Q3 alone. This expansion allows Yeti to shift strategic focus on building direct relationships with customers. It reduces reliance on third-party retailers and increases profit margins in the process. To complement this growth, Yeti is expanding their retail presence with flagship retail locations. These locations serve as experiential hubs where customers can engage with the brand.\n* **International Expansion**: International growth of over 30% indicates significant growth opportunities for the future. While it is still a small part of total sales, this growth is in many ways still in its infancy. As expansion and brand awareness continue, the international market can return a much larger share of total sales. Yeti\u2019s investments overseas have been highly rewarding. The company has seen four consecutive quarters of over 30% growth. This indicates successful market penetration and diversification\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n* The tariff concerns whether overblown or not are a real concern. Fierce competition from rivals continues to play an important factor in the battle for who has the most popular product. Yeti boasts an attractive valuation with their P/E significantly\u00a0below their 5-year average\u00a0from 36.6 to now 16.09 and a strong balance sheet. The company shows encouraging growth with enticing international expansion. This makes Yeti worth keeping an eye on at the least. Despite this, the stock has been largely flat for a year while earnings continue to outperform analyst projections. With new product offerings, Yeti showcases their strong brand reputation for premium products and further growth.",

        "selftext": "Given the seismic changes taking place in geopolitics currently, with the ground seemingly shifting on a daily basis, there is great uncertainty about the future in general, especially so with the stock markets. What seems certain right now however is a need for increasing national self-reliance in areas that are critical to defence, commerce and manufacturing. With that in mind I have decided to make a notable investment.\n\nWhen considering where to invest, in my opinion the United States is a far less appealing place to invest now than only one month ago for various reasons. Not only is there considerable political volatility and a worrying descent seemingly towards a divided, bellicose autocratic nation, apparently aligning with formerly hostile states such as Russia at the expense of long standing allies, but there is also a growing backlash to the conduct being witnessed, from within and without the United States.\n\nThis backlash includes, boycotting American companies, particularly those whose leaders have \u2018kissed the ring\u2019 and may now be supplicants, at the whim of the new administration. I expect the early impact of this boycott to be visible in the next reporting season which is only about two months away. With 41%\u00b9 of revenues generated outside of the United States for companies within the S&P500, according to Citi Global Wealth Investments, I expect the boycott may cause various companies to miss expectations, perhaps notably.\n\nWith that in mind I have looked closer to home for my next Double Bubbler investment and in an area central to defence, commerce and manufacturing. One industry that underpins these areas, and may gain from an international shift away from American manufacturers and suppliers, is that of satellite communications. So much of our modern society from trade to warfare relies on this essential technology and I expect the European Union and Britain to support their own regional champions.\n\nCompanies such as\u00a0[SES A.S](http://ses.com/). who provide a range of satellite communication services around the world, with a particularly strong presence in Europe, including being the lead partner for a consortium who will be designing, delivering and operating the next generation IRIS2\u00b2 MEO-LEO network part funded by the European Union. In short this will be a secure network for European governments, where SES retains the opportunity to commercialise \u2018over 90% of the MEO capacity and part of the LEO capacity\u2019.\n\nIn time I will write an article on why I bought 100,000 shares in SES this morning, however in brief it is their expertise, current global communications service offering as well as the potential of significant future business, a large proportion of which is already under contract. What I also particularly like about SES is that it is currently paying approximately 10% in dividends and is intent on increasing the dividend further \u2018once SES meets its net leverage target of below 3x within 12-18 months\u2019\u00b3.\n\nWhile the future is uncertain, the dividend and apparent prospects for SES, give me confidence this may be a good place to weather the storm and even prosper perhaps. Hopefully with potential share price growth together with compounding dividend reinvestments I will double my money before too long!\n\n\u00b9\u00a0[Source.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/how-much-do-companies-depend-on-foreign-revenue/)\u00a0\u00b2\u00a0[Source.](https://www.euspa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-03/IRIS2.pdf)\u00a0\u00b3\u00a0[Source.](https://www.ses.com/press-release/ses-full-year-2024-results)",

        "selftext": "* Palantir remains a high-growth company, with revenue increasing at 29% YoY and accelerating in the U.S.\n* The company has maintained GAAP profitability for eight consecutive quarters and boasts high cash flow margins.\n* Its strong moat, particularly in government contracts, is expanding, making it a trusted name in AI-driven data analytics.\n* Risks include declining billings and reliance on interest income for profitability.\n* If growth remains above 25-30%, Palantir could justify a market cap exceeding $500 billion.\n\nPalantir has defied traditional valuation metrics with a P/E ratio of 250 and a P/S (FWD) ratio above 60, making standard overvalued/undervalued classifications irrelevant. Investors in Palantir face the challenge of market irrationality, but the company's revenue growth and market position make it a compelling stock. The company specializes in data integration and analysis, catering to both government and commercial clients, with a core U.S. market generating significant revenue. Its main platforms\u2014Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo\u2014are further strengthened by the recent launch of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which helps businesses integrate large language models.\n\nPalantir\u2019s revenue surged from $595 million in 2018 to $2.87 billion in 2024, with a consistent 29% CAGR over the last five years. U.S. revenue growth accelerated throughout 2024, reaching 52% YoY in Q4. This performance led to a 12% QoQ revenue increase, a pace rarely seen in established firms with a $250 billion market cap. Palantir is successfully proving its ability to achieve software-like margins, with cash from operations in Q4 hitting $460 million, equating to a 56% margin. The company's \"Rule of 40\" score rose to 81%, further reinforcing its shift from a consulting model to a software-driven enterprise.\n\nThe company benefits from its clear philosophy and pro-Western stance, making it a preferred partner for governments and businesses prioritizing security. U.S. government and commercial revenues are accelerating, and while international growth is slower, geopolitical trends indicate increased European defense spending, which could drive further Palantir adoption. The company's partnerships, including collaborations with Anduril, position it well in defense-related AI and efficiency-driven government contracts. Its newly launched Warp Speed software is already improving efficiency in manufacturing and defense, reinforcing its moat.\n\nPalantir's total addressable market (TAM) estimates range from $230 billion in 2025 to over $1.4 trillion by 2030. The company is growing like a high-growth startup while possessing a significant competitive moat and a net dollar retention rate of 120%. Investors and analysts have consistently underestimated Palantir\u2019s ability to surpass expectations, further validating its potential for continued market expansion.\n\nHowever, there are risks. The most concerning is the decline in billings, a key indicator of future revenue momentum. If this trend persists, investor confidence in Palantir\u2019s high valuation could weaken. Additionally, the company\u2019s profitability is currently propped up by interest income, which accounted for $196.8 million of its $468 million net income in 2024. If rates decline, this income stream will shrink, making it imperative for Palantir to generate more profit from its core operations.\n\nDespite these concerns, as long as Palantir maintains growth above 25-30%, the bullish narrative is likely to hold, and the stock could continue its upward trajectory. If growth slows, valuation concerns could trigger a sharp correction.\n\n**TL;DR:** Palantir is experiencing rapid growth with strong government and commercial adoption. Its moat is expanding, but risks like declining billings and reliance on interest income pose potential challenges. If it maintains its momentum, the stock could continue to rise significantly.",

        "selftext": "TopBuild is maintained with a HOLD rating, as we lower its price target amid macroeconomic challenges, particularly in the residential housing sector. Despite low growth expectations, the company continues aggressive acquisitions and capital allocation strategies. Its resilient business model and strong cash flow support potential long-term growth, though short-term sales declines are anticipated.\n\nInvestment Thesis:\n\nIn our first TopBuild report in December, we started our coverage with a HOLD rating. Our original price target was $401. After the conclusion of Q4 and fiscal 2024 results, we maintain our rating. Nonetheless, we have reduced our price target by 3.3% to $388 instead. After receiving updated management guidance, we believe the current macroeconomic environment continues to be a major headwind. There is much uncertainty about the residential housing market. Growth is expected at low single-digits or negative year-over-year. This is despite management maintaining a strong acquisition strategy.\n\n# Key Drivers\n\n* **Acquisition Strategy:** TopBuild has a strong history of acquiring smaller insulation and building material firms. In fiscal 2024 alone, they acquired a total of 8 companies between installation and specialty distribution. In total, the companies annual sales totaled $153.1 million in annual sales. Most recently, on February 3, 2025, TopBuild acquired Seal-Rite. Seal-Rite is a provider of fiberglass and spray foam insulation for residential and commercial markets in Omaha and Lincoln. With the acquisition set to close in Q2, Seal-Rite Insulation generated annual sales of $15 million.\n* **Resilient Business Model & Pricing Power:** Despite an uncertain residential and construction environment, TopBuild has shown resilience. Unlike say bathroom renovations or flooring upgrades, insulation is a necessity for residential and commercial projects. Additionally, serving both the residential and commercial markets helps to mitigate risks linked to slowdowns in any one segment. If new home construction declines or worsens, 35% of 2024 sales were still in commercial/industrial construction. The insulation industry as a whole remains highly fragmented with many local and regional players competing at smaller scales. TopBuild has capitalized on its scale to unify growing market share via strategic acquisitions. TopBuild is unique because it has a vertically integrated business model. It combines installation services (TruTeam) and distribution (Service Partners) under one corporate umbrella.\n* **Cash Flow Generation:** A major aspect of TopBuild's investment appeal is due to their effective capital allocation. The company has demonstrated a willingness to use strong cash flow generation to fund their M&A service offering. Aside from acquisitions, TopBuild is known to repurchase their outstanding stock. In their Q4 and year-end results, management announced a new authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion worth of shares. This new authorization is adds to the $188.1 million remaining from the prior announcement as of December 31, 2024. While free cash flow did decline by 10%, the company still reported strong results with total generation of $706.7 million.\n\n*Conclusion*\n\nTopBuild's near-term growth is in a peculiar environment as costs stay elevated and labor shortages continue. The 2025 outlook provided by management indicated sales between $5.05 billion and $5.35 billion. The most-likely scenario is that sales will decline year-over-year. This would be the first time since becoming a public company a decade ago in 2015. M&A continue to be a priority moving ahead with one already planned to be completed in Q2. Acquisitions have proven to be a strategic growth aim with 8 taking place in 2024 contributing $153.1 in annual sales. With their strong free cash flow generation, TopBuild continues to repurchase a significant amount of shares with their newly announced $1 billion program.\n\nDespite short-term concerns, TopBuild is well-positioned for long-term growth due to structural housing supply constraints. There is a strong reliance on an uncertain residential housing market. Still, management expects low-single digit growth in commercial/industrial sales. These sales account for a growing $1.88 billion in sales (43.9% total).\n\n# Risk Factors:\n\n* **Residential Construction Sensitivity:** With 61.7% of sales coming from the residential market, a downturn can significantly reduce insulation demand. Management already expects a mid-single digit decline in fiscal 2025 which is set to hinder overall sales growth. Although TopBuild has diversified into commercial/industrial insulation, the residential market is heavily relied upon to continue growing. One of the primary drivers of housing market cyclicality is the cost of borrowing. Mortgage rates stay elevated with a 30-year fixed rate mortgage hovering around 6.7%. While rates have fluctuated, the high cost of financing a home persists. This has led to lower housing demand. As a result, existing home sales have declined.\n* **Raw Material & Supply Chain Risks:** There is significant dependence on raw material availability. Cost fluctuations in insulation materials, particularly fiberglass and spray foam, pose concerns. If raw material costs increase and TopBuild can't pass them on to customers, profit margins will be squeezed. In recent years, logistics bottlenecks and material shortages have affected the insulation industry leading to higher costs and delayed projects. Both of which hurt overall sales.\n\nHope this helps anyone interested in TopBuild or the industry as whole & starts a conversation from the community!",

        "title": "Debt Wall on the Horizon: Will 2025 Mark the Economic Turning Point?",
        "selftext": "**The Setup:**   \nWe're at the dawn of 2025, and the Treasury market is facing a detox. Why? Because former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had a love affair with short-term borrowing. Now, we're staring at a maturity wall where over $3.6 trillion in Treasury bills are due. Sounds like a financial hangover, doesn't it?\n\n  \n**The Twist:**  \nEnter Scott Bessent, the new kid on the block with a different approach. He wants to pivot from this short-term debt strategy to long-term securities. But here's the catch \u2013 this shift could mean higher borrowing costs for taxpayers down the line. Is this a necessary evil or a fiscal misstep?\n\n  \n**The Plot Thickens:**  \nLast year's TIPS auction was telling. Demand was weak, with a yield tail of 7 basis points from an expected yield of 2.05% to a settled yield of 2.121%. It's like investors are getting cold feet, unsure about inflation or just distracted by the shinier nominal Treasuries yielding 4.44%. \n\n  \n**The Liquidity Illusion:**  \nYellen's strategy was to issue tons of short-term debt, pulling cash from the Fed's Reverse Repo Program into the market, essentially keeping the liquidity tap open. But with this debt maturing, we might see a liquidity crunch. Here's where it gets interesting \u2013 the RRP has dropped from a peak of $2.5 trillion to $250 billion, and as T-bills become scarce, what happens to market liquidity?\n\n  \n**The Long Game:**  \nBessent's strategy might stabilize things, but at what price? Increased issuance of long-term bonds could push yields up, squeezing the economy where it hurts \u2013 growth and investment. And with quantitative tightening in play, there's less of a safety net for the market. The last TIPS auction had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.1, the lowest since 2019, signaling hesitance.\n\n  \n**Questions for You:**  \n\n\n* Do you think this shift from short to long-term debt is the right move, or are we just trading one problem for another?\n* How will this affect your investment strategy? Are you preparing for higher yields and possibly a market correction?\n* What do you foresee as the implications for small businesses if liquidity tightens, especially with the Fed potentially cutting rates?\n* Could this be the moment inflation finally breaks free, or are we looking at a managed descent?\n\n**The Endgame:**  \nI'm genuinely curious about your thoughts. Is this a storm we should be battening down the hatches for, or just another chapter in the ever-evolving saga of economic policy? Let's chew the fat on this one \u2013 share your insights, predictions, or even better, tell us how you're playing your cards in this high-stakes game.\n\nFull detailed article here if you want to dig deeper: [https://tetractysresearch.com/p/running-into-a-wall](https://tetractysresearch.com/p/running-into-a-wall)\n\n*TL;DR: The Treasury's reliance on short-term debt has led to a 2025 maturity wall with over $3.6 trillion in bills due. The new strategy involves more long-term debt, potentially affecting liquidity, inflation, and the broader economy. What's your take?*",

        "title": "Dollar General: Undervaluation Poses Great Long-term Value",
        "selftext": "Dollar General faces rising costs, supply issues, and theft, squeezing margins. Trading at 2017 lows, its expansion in underserved markets supports long-term growth, making it a strong buy opportunity for investors.\n\n\\*I do not own any shares at this time\n\n# Macro Overview:\n\n# Retail Sector Trends\n\nIn recent years, the discount retail sector has faced significant pressure. Discount retailers like Dollar General,\u00a0Dollar Tree\u00a0and\u00a0Five Below\u00a0have been experiencing rising costs leading to margins being squeezed. Supply chain constraints and wage increases have contributed mightily to profitability deterioration.\n\nWhile the discount retail sector undergoing challenges, large retailers like\u00a0Walmart,\u00a0Costco, and\u00a0Amazon\u00a0have flourished. Inflation continues to play a significant role despite declining significantly from its\u00a0June 2022 peak of 9.1%. As inflation remains above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target, the discount retail sector will continue to face pressure.\n\n# Rising Shrink and Inventory Losses\n\nShrink, the industry term for theft, have contributed to billions of losses each year across the retail industry.\u00a0According to Capital One Research, stores lost $121.6 billion to retail theft in 2023 with projections indicating shoplifting could cost retailers $143 billion in 2025.\n\nIn particular, Dollar General noted in their Q3 earnings report that shrink was a major reason for margin compression. As a result, self-checkout has been removed in some stores and converted to assisted checkout. High employee turnover across the industry has lead many stores to be understaffed further exacerbating shrink concerns.\n\n# Tariff implementation\n\nPresident Trump recently announced\u00a0he would place 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico as well as 10% tariffs on goods from China effective February 1st. If officially implemented, this will dramatically impact the U.S. economy, consumer spending, and the entire retail sector. Retailers will likely increase costs on thousands of goods. This comes at a time when consumers have already cut back.\n\nTake Dollar General for example. Price-sensitive consumers are their bread and butter so to speak. Further increases will deter them even more so than they have already been in recent years. Consumables account for 82.9% of Dollar General\u2019s Q3 sales. With such heavy reliance on this segment, increased tariffs may hurt margins even further.\n\n# Investment Thesis:\n\nShort-term pressure has caused a steep decline in profitability metrics with low single-digit growth. Despite this, Dollar General remains a strong brand with an established presence in rural America. What separates them from their competition, is the niche audience they serve, where other retailers are not available. This strategy bodes well for them in undeserved markets regardless of the economic outlook. They may continue to face margin erosion in the short-term but their footprint in the U.S. and market appeal remains in tact.\n\n# Key Drivers\n\n* **Expansion Strategy & Project Elevate:**\u00a0Dollar General remains focused on the future after their Q3 results. For fiscal year ending January 30, 2026 (fiscal year 2025), 4,885 real estate projects are expected. This includes approximately 575 new stores, with 15 in Mexico. Also in Q3, \u201cProject Elevate\u201d was announced. The plan includes expanding their store remodel program to approximately 2,250 stores and the relocation of 45 stores. Same-store sales increased by 1.3% indicating current stress may be showing signs of improvement. Cash & equivalents grew by 47% to $537.26 million compared to net debt of $5.72 billion which declined by -16.4%.\n* **Current Valuation:**\u00a0As of January 29, 2025, the stock has a current price of $72.04, its lowest levels since late 2017. As you can see below from the charts via\u00a0MacroTrends, Dollar General\u2019s stock has declined substantially in the 1-year period as well as the 5-year period by -44.9% and -51.1% respectively. This has resulted in a P/E ratio of just 11.70, significantly below their 5-year average of 20.1. Dollar General has declined significantly yet they still pay a strong dividend with a yield of 3.3% adding to the attractiveness as well as the clear undervaluation.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe recent significant declines in Dollar General\u2019s stock positions them to be at their lowest share price since 2017. Ironically, the company has grown from $21.99 billion to $38.69 billion, an increase of 75% in those eight years. Short-term headwinds have created serious pressures on the company in recent years. Inflation first reached elevated levels. Now, it remains stubborn. Profitability has decreased substantially. Despite this, the increase in revenue and persistence in expansion has not stopped Dollar General from charging ahead.\n\n# Risk Factors:\n\n* **Competitive Pressures:**\u00a0Walmart continues to invest billions in e-commerce, curbside pickup, and grocery delivery. Dollar General only offers these services at select locations and typically do not offer same-say delivery for groceries like Walmart. Walmart uses its supplier network and distribution effectively. This strategy allows them to offer lower prices on many essential goods that can undercut Dollar General. Dollar General has made notable strides in e-commerce and curbside pickup options, Walmart\u2019s infrastructure is vastly superior.\n* **Regulatory & Tariff Risk:**\u00a0On February 1st, 2025, President Trump\u00a0signed an executive order. The order issues tariffs for goods coming into the U.S from Canada, Mexico, and China. While it is unclear when the tariffs will take effect, it is certain they will impact consumers significantly. The possibility of them being lifted remains unknown. Consumables in particular account for the vast majority of total sales.\u00a0According to Third Way, grocery items are projected to increase by 15% as a result of tariffs. If that analysis is correct, the increased costs will primarily affect Dollar General\u2019s customers the worst as they tend to be the most cost-conscious.",

        "title": "ASPI DD - In it for the Long-Term",
        "selftext": "**TLDR:** If ASPI\u2019s technology is truly what they say it is \u2013 this could be a 100x stock. Which wouldn\u2019t be crazy given a $400M market cap currently (growing to $40B would be 100x). They could be one of the few Western providers of HALEU to fuel the West\u2019s nuclear ambitions while deploying absurdly low capex. Not to mention potential revenue coming from the nuclear medicine and semiconductor fields (although I think the true homerun is with HALEU). However, if their technology isn\u2019t as powerful as they say it is, this could be a true nothing-burger. Regardless, it is a bet I am willing to take. **Currently long 6,850 shares and looking to add more.**\n\n**Bullish Points:**\n\n\u2022 **Potential to Lower Isotope Costs**: ASP Isotopes has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of isotope enrichment through its proprietary Quantum Enrichment (QE) technology, which is more efficient and less expensive than traditional methods like centrifugation. The company's Aerodynamic Separation Process (ASP) is also comparable in efficiency to traditional centrifugation but at a much lower cost.\n\n\u2022 **Countering Russian Dominance**: ASP Isotopes could help the West reduce its reliance on Russia for uranium supply, particularly for HALEU, which is crucial for next-generation reactors. This is especially important given geopolitical concerns and the US government's efforts to establish a domestic supply chain.\n\n\u2022 **HALEU Fuel Production**: The company's technology is positioned to supply HALEU fuel for next-generation Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which are expected to drive nuclear industry growth. ASP's technology could be a low-cost platform to enhance HALEU production. Costs could be as low at $10M to cerate a QE plant to enrich uranium as compared to traditional centrifugation which costs in the $Billions. This alone is \u2013 if the technology is truly legit \u2013 could be massively impactful for the company and the whole industry. I believe the CEO, Paul Mann, wants to spin out QLE (the portion of the business that will work on enriching Uranium (HALEU) for nuclear energy. Need to keep an eye on this and how exactly that will/would affect the mechanics of owning shares in ASPI. But either way for now, the nuclear business is wrapped up with $ASPI.\n\n  o\u00a0\u00a0 Per the company\u2019s website: \u201cASPI recently entered into a Term Sheet with TerraPower LLC which contemplates TerraPower providing funding for the construction of a HALEU Facility and TerraPower purchasing HALEU produced at the facility.\u201d TerraPower is a Bill Gates backed Nuclear company. So I would assume at least Bill Gates thinks ASPI\u2019s technology is worth taking a risk on partnering on. This happened on 11/14/24 btw, so old news.\n\n\u2022 **Diverse Isotope Applications**: ASP Isotopes' enrichment technologies can produce a variety of isotopes for use in nuclear energy, nuclear medicine, and semiconductors, offering diverse revenue streams. The company already has supply contracts in place for isotopes such as molybdenum-100, carbon-14, and silicon-28.\n\n\u2022 **Vertical Integration**: With the acquisition of PET Labs, ASP Isotopes has the potential to become a vertically integrated radioisotope supplier, creating feedstock isotopes for its medical arm. I\u2019m not sure how big of an opportunity this could be but they do produce YT-176 which is the isotope used by Novartis\u2019s Pluvicto (prostate cancer treatment). Well technically I think they convert the YT-176 to YT-177 for treatment, but you get the point. For this drug alone reached \\~$1B in 2023. ASPI announced construction of a YT plant on 9/3/24 according to their website.\n\n\u2022 **Attractive Takeover Target**: If the company demonstrates commercial production at scale, it could become an attractive acquisition target for larger companies. I don\u2019t invest hoping for a takeover, but given the small market cap of this company, (\\~$400M at last check), any big-name utility or hyperscaler could easily buy them out just for their tech.\n\n\u2022 **Proprietary Technology**: ASP Isotopes possesses two novel, proprietary enrichment methods: the Aerodynamic Separation Process (ASP) and Quantum Enrichment (QE). I\u2019m not an expert on their technology of course, but I believe it is proprietary to them. Would love to hear more on this as the whole thesis hangs on them being different and being able to construct plants at very low costs (especially for HALEU).\n\n\u2022 **Strategic Locations**: The company is expanding into Iceland, which is attractive for its low energy costs, regulatory support, and proximity to a major shipping port. They will also add plants in South Africa.\n\n\u2022 **Government Support**: The US government is actively working to establish a domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel, which is a positive sign for ASP Isotopes. It does worry me that they aren\u2019t a US company, but building in SA and Iceland for now would be considered friendly and the US could do business with them. We know this given TerraPower has begun working with the company.\n\n\u2022 **Established Operations**: ASP has already commissioned a small-scale plant and has commercial contracts. For now, revenue is still miniscule, but hopefully this will change soon.\n\n**Bearish Points:**\n\n\u2022 **Commercial Scale Risk**: While the company's technology has been proven in the lab (so they claim), the ability to scale up to commercial production has yet to be demonstrated. There is a risk that the company will not be able to reach commercial scale after successful lab trials.\n\n\u2022 **Political Risk in South Africa**: The company's operations in South Africa may be subject to political risk, including the potential for unforeseen curtailments around the proliferation of enrichment technologies. This risk also includes concerns about the ability to export isotopes from South Africa.\n\n  o\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m also worried about a Trump administration for ASPI. I\u2019m not sure if this will be beneficial for them or not. Nuclear is bipartisan (one of the only areas that Congress agrees on), and while normally I would think friendly relations with Russia/Putin would be a good thing for the USA and the world, if relations get too friendly, it is possible Trump opens up trade again with Russia. This would definitely hurt ASPI\u2019s growth potential.\n\n\u2022 **Regulatory Approvals**: ASP Isotopes needs to obtain necessary government approvals and permits in South Africa for HALEU production, as well as in other countries like Iceland and for other end markets. I think they will be able to do this, but honestly idk how government regs and approvals work.\n\n\u2022 **HALEU Demand Risk**: The demand for HALEU fuel is dependent on the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approving HALEU-based SMRs, which is not yet a certainty. $SMR has an approved SMR but doesn\u2019t really have any legit customers yet (I\u2019m also long $SMR and $OKLO). I do think the NRC will give approvals but I am unsure about the timeline. But if approvals do come, ASPI is in a great position to be a Western provider of HALEU.\n\n\u2022 **Balance Sheet/Liquidity Concerns**: The company may need additional capital to execute its ambitious growth plans. In fact that is probably a certainty that dilution is on the board in the future. Maybe they can get more contracts with customers who will partner and help fund some of the costs of capex, but who knows. That would also come with some sort of downsides like being locked into only selling HALEU to that customer/partner for a certain amount of time (like the TerraPower deal).\n\n\u2022 **Competition**: While the company claims its technology is superior to traditional methods and has lower costs, it faces competition from existing players in the nuclear fuel and isotope enrichment industry. Again, not an expert on this, but figured I\u2019d note it again as it came to mind and is a huge risk.\u00a0\n\n\u2022 **Shorts Taking Aim**: Some group called \u201cFuzzy Panda\u201d put out a short report in late Nov 2024 that rocked the stock (fell from $8 to $4 in like 2 weeks). While I think this anonymous group called \u201cFuzzy Panda\u201d made a bag shorting this stock, and they do bring up a couple legitimate concerns, I ultimately think the stock will shake this off. TerraPower (backed by Bill Gates) gives me some hope that the company is legit. Regardless, the stock is in the cross-hairs of the shorts right now which will add to the volatility of this already volatile stock.",

        "title": "Primer on Monetary Mechanics",
        "selftext": "Understanding monetary liquidity is key to unpacking risk-assets. \n\nUnderstanding the mechanics of monetary systems requires unpacking the interplay between central banks, commercial banks, financial markets, and the broader economy. At its core, the Federal Reserve (Fed) operates as the cornerstone of the U.S. monetary system, managing the supply of money and credit to achieve its dual mandate: price stability and full employment. To comprehend this system, we\u2019ll explore the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, its tools, and how these influence the economy.\n\n# 1. The Federal Reserve Balance Sheet\n\nThe Fed\u2019s balance sheet consists of assets and liabilities, which interact to shape liquidity and monetary conditions in the economy:\n\n# Assets\n\n1. **U.S. Treasuries**:\n   * Treasury securities (bills, notes, and bonds) are the largest asset class on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. They represent loans to the federal government and are considered virtually risk-free.\n   * The Fed purchases Treasuries during open market operations to inject liquidity into the financial system. These purchases lower yields, reducing borrowing costs across the economy and encouraging investment.\n   * Conversely, selling Treasuries reduces liquidity and raises yields, acting as a tightening measure.\n2. **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)**:\n   * Acquired during quantitative easing (QE) programs, MBS purchases aim to stabilize the housing market by lowering mortgage rates.\n   * The Fed\u2019s involvement in the MBS market creates demand, which supports liquidity for banks and other institutions issuing these securities.\n3. **Loans to Financial Institutions**:\n   * Includes discount window loans and emergency lending facilities. These loans provide short-term funding to banks facing liquidity crises, ensuring stability in the financial system.\n   * During financial crises, such as in 2008 or 2020, these facilities act as a critical backstop to prevent systemic collapse.\n4. **Other Assets**:\n   * This category includes foreign currency reserves, gold certificates, and various liquidity facilities established during times of stress, such as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).\n\n# Liabilities\n\n1. **Reserve Balances**:\n   * Reserves are deposits held by commercial banks at the Fed. These reserves play a central role in monetary policy as they determine the amount of liquidity in the banking system.\n   * Excess reserves, beyond what banks are required to hold, can be lent out, influencing credit creation and economic activity.\n2. **Currency in Circulation**:\n   * Physical cash held by the public and financial institutions. This is the most visible component of the money supply but represents only a fraction of total liquidity.\n3. **Treasury General Account (TGA)**:\n   * The U.S. Treasury\u2019s account at the Fed. It acts as the government\u2019s checking account, with inflows from tax revenues and debt issuance and outflows for spending programs.\n   * Changes in the TGA have a direct impact on reserves in the banking system, affecting liquidity.\n   * **TGA Interactions with Reserves**:\n      * When the Treasury spends (TGA drawdown), funds flow into the banking system, increasing bank reserves and liquidity. For example, payments for infrastructure projects deposit money into contractor accounts at commercial banks, raising reserve balances.\n      * Conversely, when the Treasury issues debt and deposits proceeds into the TGA (TGA build-up), reserves are drained from the banking system as banks and other institutions purchase Treasury securities, reducing liquidity. This process effectively tightens financial conditions.\n      * Large swings in the TGA balance can create volatility in reserve levels, forcing the Fed to adjust its operations to maintain stability in short-term funding markets.\n4. **Reverse Repo Facility (RRP)**:\n   * A mechanism allowing money market funds and other participants to lend cash to the Fed overnight. This temporarily reduces liquidity in the system while providing a risk-free return to lenders.\n   * **RRP Interactions with Reserves**:\n      * Funds parked in the RRP are removed from the banking system\u2019s reserves temporarily, reducing the overall liquidity available for lending and investment. This can help the Fed manage excess reserves during periods of abundant liquidity.\n      * When funds flow out of the RRP (e.g., as MMFs chase higher yields in T-bills), reserves increase, adding liquidity back into the system. This interplay directly influences the velocity of money and the availability of credit.\n\n# 2. Key Monetary Tools and Their Mechanics\n\n# 1. Open Market Operations (OMO)\n\n* The Fed\u2019s primary tool for managing liquidity involves buying or selling government securities in the open market.\n* **Buying Assets**: When the Fed buys Treasuries or MBS, it credits reserves to the selling bank\u2019s account. This increases system-wide reserves and lowers interest rates by increasing the demand for these assets.\n* **Selling Assets**: When the Fed sells securities, it reduces reserves in the banking system, raising interest rates and tightening monetary conditions.\n\n# 2. Quantitative Easing (QE) and Quantitative Tightening (QT)\n\n* **QE**: Large-scale asset purchases by the Fed to inject liquidity into the economy. By lowering long-term interest rates, QE encourages borrowing, investment, and risk-taking.\n* **QT**: The reverse of QE, where the Fed reduces its balance sheet by allowing securities to mature or actively selling them. This drains reserves and tightens financial conditions, slowing economic activity.\n\n# 3. Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB)\n\n* The Fed pays interest on reserves held by banks. By adjusting the IORB rate, the Fed influences banks\u2019 incentives to lend or hold reserves:\n   * **Higher IORB**: Encourages banks to hold reserves, reducing credit creation.\n   * **Lower IORB**: Promotes lending, increasing money supply and economic activity.\n\n# 4. Discount Window Lending\n\n* The Fed\u2019s discount window provides emergency funding to banks facing short-term liquidity shortages. While rarely used under normal conditions, it\u2019s a vital safety net during crises.\n* The availability of this facility enhances market confidence, ensuring that temporary liquidity issues don\u2019t escalate into broader financial instability.\n\n# 5. Reverse Repo Facility (RRP)\n\n* The RRP provides a floor for short-term interest rates by offering a risk-free return for cash parked at the Fed. This tool helps the Fed maintain control over its policy rate, particularly in times of excess liquidity.\n* **Detailed RRP Mechanics**:\n   * The RRP operates by allowing money market funds, government-sponsored enterprises, and other eligible participants to invest cash with the Fed overnight. In return, participants receive a fixed interest rate.\n   * Funds placed in the RRP are effectively removed from the banking system\u2019s reserves, reducing liquidity and high-velocity money in the economy. This dampens inflationary pressures and helps stabilize short-term interest rates.\n* **Impact of RRP Depletion**:\n   * If the RRP were emptied, participants would redirect funds into other short-term instruments like T-bills or commercial paper. This would inject liquidity back into the system, increasing bank reserves and amplifying the velocity of money.\n   * Without the RRP as a buffer, the Fed would face greater challenges in controlling short-term interest rates during periods of excess liquidity. This could lead to heightened volatility in money markets and complicate monetary policy execution.\n\n# 3. The Mechanics of Liquidity\n\n# Monetary Base vs. Money Supply\n\n* **Monetary Base (M0)**: The sum of currency in circulation and reserves held at the Fed. This forms the foundation of the money supply.\n* **Money Supply (M1, M2)**: Includes currency, demand deposits, and broader money aggregates. These reflect the multiplier effect of bank lending and public spending.\n\n# Liquidity Creation\n\n* The Fed injects reserves into the system through asset purchases or lending. Banks, in turn, use these reserves to create loans, expanding the money supply.\n* The extent of liquidity creation depends on demand for credit, regulatory constraints, and economic conditions.\n\n# Liquidity Drains\n\n* Tools like QT, RRP, and TGA operations remove liquidity by reducing reserves or diverting funds into low-velocity accounts, tightening financial conditions.\n* **Velocity of Money**:\n   * Velocity measures how quickly money circulates in the economy. High velocity indicates active economic participation and rapid money turnover, often accompanying inflationary pressures.\n   * Tools like the RRP and TGA effectively lower velocity by locking up funds in low-velocity accounts. Conversely, liquidity injections increase velocity by providing funds for spending and investment.\n\n# 4. The Treasury General Account (TGA)\n\nThe TGA functions as the government\u2019s primary account, influencing liquidity in the financial system:\n\n* **TGA Drawdowns**: When the Treasury spends, funds flow from the TGA into the banking system. This increases bank reserves, enhancing liquidity and economic activity.\n   * For example, when the Treasury pays contractors or distributes social security benefits, the receiving entities deposit the funds in their commercial bank accounts. These deposits simultaneously increase reserve balances at the Fed.\n* **TGA Build-ups**: Conversely, when the Treasury issues debt and deposits proceeds into the TGA, reserves are drained from the banking system.\n   * The draining effect reduces the liquidity available for banks to lend and invest, tightening financial conditions. This interaction is particularly impactful during periods of large-scale government borrowing.\n* **TGA and RRP Interactions**:\n   * A TGA build-up often coincides with increased RRP usage, as excess liquidity flows from banks into the RRP to earn interest while being temporarily idle. This dynamic reduces the reserves available in the banking system, amplifying the liquidity drain effect.\n   * Conversely, TGA drawdowns can reduce reliance on the RRP by injecting liquidity directly into the economy, increasing reserves and the velocity of money.\n\n# 5. Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) and Money Market Dynamics\n\n# The Role of the RRP\n\n* The RRP acts as a liquidity management tool, attracting excess cash from money market participants during periods of high liquidity.\n* By setting the RRP rate, the Fed influences short-term market rates, steering liquidity toward desired levels.\n\n# Interaction with T-Bills\n\n* Money market funds (MMFs) allocate funds between the RRP and T-bills based on relative yields. When T-bill yields exceed the RRP rate, MMFs shift funds to T-bills, increasing their demand.\n* This dynamic affects liquidity distribution across financial markets, influencing short-term funding costs.\n* **Market Impact of RRP Usage**:\n   * High RRP usage reflects excess liquidity and a lack of attractive investment alternatives. It signals that market participants prefer the safety and yield of the RRP over riskier assets.\n   * Low RRP usage, or a complete depletion, suggests increased risk appetite or higher yields in alternative markets, which can signal tighter monetary conditions or shifting liquidity dynamics.\n\n# 6. Interactions with the Real Economy\n\n# Credit Creation and Multiplier Effect\n\n* Reserves provide the foundation for banks to lend. The actual expansion of credit depends on:\n   * **Borrower Demand**: Businesses and households must seek credit for productive activities.\n   * **Bank Health**: Capital adequacy and balance sheet constraints determine lending capacity.\n\n# Impact on Asset Prices\n\n* Abundant liquidity supports higher valuations for equities, real estate, and other risk assets by lowering discount rates and encouraging risk-taking.\n* Liquidity contractions can trigger market corrections, as higher rates and tighter conditions reduce investment.\n\n# Interest Rates and Borrowing Costs\n\n* The Fed\u2019s policies shape short-term interest rates directly and influence long-term borrowing costs through market expectations, affecting consumption and investment decisions.\n\n# 7. Balancing Act: Managing Reserves, RRP, and TGA\n\nThe Fed\u2019s challenge lies in balancing reserve levels, RRP usage, and TGA fluctuations to achieve desired monetary conditions:\n\n* **Excess Reserves**: Ensure smooth functioning of payment systems and interbank markets, preventing liquidity shortages.\n* **RRP and TGA Dynamics**: Modulate short-term liquidity without destabilizing funding markets or creating undue volatility.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe Fed\u2019s monetary mechanics operate like a finely tuned machine, with its balance sheet acting as the engine and its tools as levers. By understanding these interactions, one can appreciate how central bank policies ripple through the financial system, shaping liquidity, credit, and economic outcomes. While the mechanics are intricate, their influence is far-reaching, underscoring the pivotal role of monetary policy in modern economies.",

        "title": "Some publicly traded agriculture companies likely to be impacted if immigrant labor goes away:",
        "selftext": "Several publicly traded agricultural companies in the United States could be significantly impacted if immigrant labor, particularly from Latin America, were to decrease or go away. These companies rely heavily on labor-intensive processes such as planting, harvesting, and processing, which are often staffed by immigrant workers. Here are some notable examples:\n\n1. **Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. (Ticker: FDP)**\n   * **Overview:** Fresh Del Monte is a leading producer and distributor of fresh and fresh-cut fruit and vegetables.\n   * **Impact:** The company operates large farming operations in the U.S., especially in states like California and Florida, where immigrant labor is crucial for harvesting seasonal crops.\n2. **Dole plc (Ticker: DOLE)**\n   * **Overview:** Dole is one of the world's largest producers of high-quality fresh fruit and vegetables.\n   * **Impact:** Reliance on immigrant labor is significant for their U.S. operations, particularly in harvesting and processing perishable goods.\n3. **Calavo Growers, Inc. (Ticker: CVGW)**\n   * **Overview:** Calavo specializes in avocados and other perishable foods, operating packing and distribution facilities.\n   * **Impact:** The company's operations depend on skilled labor for picking and packing, roles often filled by immigrants.\n4. **Tyson Foods, Inc. (Ticker: TSN)**\n   * **Overview:** Tyson is one of the world's largest food companies and a recognized leader in protein.\n   * **Impact:** Immigrant workers constitute a substantial part of the workforce in their meat processing plants.\n5. **Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (Ticker: PPC)**\n   * **Overview:** Pilgrim's Pride is a major chicken producer with facilities across the U.S.\n   * **Impact:** The company relies on immigrant labor for processing and packaging operations.\n6. **Seaboard Corporation (Ticker: SEB)**\n   * **Overview:** Seaboard has diversified operations, including pork production and processing.\n   * **Impact:** Labor-intensive meat processing units could face challenges without immigrant workers.\n7. **Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (Ticker: LW)**\n   * **Overview:** Lamb Weston is a leading supplier of frozen potato products.\n   * **Impact:** Agricultural production and processing facilities may be affected by labor shortages.\n8. **The Andersons, Inc. (Ticker: ANDE)**\n   * **Overview:** The company operates in the grain, ethanol, and plant nutrient sectors.\n   * **Impact:** While not directly involved in farming, a decrease in agricultural output due to labor issues could impact their business.\n9. **Archer Daniels Midland Company (Ticker: ADM)**\n   * **Overview:** ADM is a global leader in human and animal nutrition and the world's premier agricultural origination and processing company.\n   * **Impact:** Disruptions in the agricultural supply chain could affect their operations, although they are more involved in processing and distribution.\n10. **Bunge Limited (Ticker: BG)**\n   * **Overview:** Bunge is an agribusiness and food company with integrated operations.\n   * **Impact:** Similar to ADM, Bunge could face indirect effects from labor shortages impacting crop availability.\n\n**Potential Impacts of Reduced Immigrant Labor:**\n\n* **Operational Disruptions:** Labor shortages could lead to delays in planting and harvesting, affecting crop yields and quality.\n* **Increased Costs:** Companies might face higher labor costs as they compete for a smaller pool of workers or invest in automation.\n* **Supply Chain Issues:** Reduced production can lead to shortages of raw materials for processing facilities.\n* **Financial Performance:** Decreased operational efficiency and increased costs could impact profitability and shareholder value.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n* **Automation:** Some companies may mitigate labor shortages through increased automation, though this requires significant investment.\n* **Policy Changes:** Immigration policies and labor laws can have immediate effects on labor availability.\n* **Diversification:** Companies with diversified operations may be better positioned to absorb labor-related disruptions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe dependence on immigrant labor in agriculture is significant for many publicly traded companies. A reduction in this workforce could have wide-ranging effects on operations, costs, and the overall supply chain. Investors and stakeholders should monitor immigration policies and labor market trends as part of their risk assessment for these companies.",

Realize the US needs immigration to grow our economy as our native birth rate is not high enough to drive the economy. If the Trump administration did follow through with mass deportation of 11M non-citizen workers, 7% of US workforce, they would spend a lot of money and likely put the US into a recession as businesses would be starved of workers. My guess is deportation will be in the 2M range over 4 years while at the same time new arrivals will arrive at a reduced rate similar to his first term.",

        "title": "Pfizer Investment Analysis: Strong Q3 Performance, Strategic Growth in Oncology and Weight Loss Markets, and High Dividend Appeal for Long-Term Investors",
        "selftext": "**Summary**\n\n* **Buy Recommendation**: Pfizer shows strong growth potential and income appeal.\n* **Q3 Performance**: 32% year-over-year growth with expanding non-COVID revenue.\n* **Strategic Focus**: Shifting to oncology and weight loss treatments to drive future growth.\n* **High Dividend Yield**: Attractive for income-focused investors.\n* **Debt Reduction**: Strengthens financial stability and flexibility.\n* **Long-Term Potential**: Diversified pipeline supports growth beyond COVID-related products.\n\n**Introduction & Pfizer\u2019s Q3 Performance**\n\nPfizer delivered strong third quarter 2024 financial results. According to an article published on Pfizer Investor Insights, \u201cThe company reported revenues of $17.7 billion in the third quarter, representing 32% year-over-year growth. Excluding the company\u2019s COVID-19 products, revenues were $13.6 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 14% compared with the prior-year quarter. Third quarter revenue growth was driven primarily by a combination of contributions from Pfizer\u2019s Oncology products, key in-line products, recent commercial launches, as well as heightened demand for its COVID-19 oral treatment. This quarter marks Pfizer\u2019s impressive third consecutive quarter of growth in 2024. Based on the recent quarter performance, the company once again raised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance and adjusted diluted EPS guidance. The company once again increased its full-year 2024 sales projection and modified diluted EPS guidance as a result of the last quarter's success.\u00a0\n\n**COVID Franchise & Non-COVID Growth Options**\n\nPfizer\u2019s current focus on oncology and other rare diseases highlights the transition from its reliance on COVID products. Pfizer must now shift its focus to other areas due to a consistent decline in revenue from its COVID products. According to CNBC, Pfizer\u2019s revenue dropped by 33% in 2023. While people in the market are concerned about Pfizer's post-COVID growth because of the patent expirations and increased competition, Pfizer is addressing these challenges by investing heavily in R&D and strategic acquisitions. Pfizer is also leveraging mRNA technology, proven in its COVID vaccine, for other potential vaccines and genetic treatments to provide further success showing future promise . With a strong balance sheet and a diversified portfolio, Pfizer is focusing to maintain robust growth despite the loss of COVID-related revenue.\n\n**Guidance & Capital Allocation Framework**\n\nPfizer\u2019s guidance for 2024 project revenues estimates $58.5 and $61.5 billion, reflecting a moderated outlook compared to last year as the demand for COVID-19 products like Paxlovid stabilizes. This outlook shows shifts in COVID-19 product demand, including Paxlovid and Comirnaty, expected to bring in about 8 billion dollars. Despite this, Pfizer\u2019s portfolio is positioned for growth between 8-10% outside COVID-19/pandemic-related products with the recent acquisition of Seagen. Despite decreasing legacy COVID-19 revenues, Pfizer is focused on scaling the oncology, vaccines, and anti-infective products/segments to increase revenue. In cash management, Pfizer is showing a conservative approach, opting not to repurchase shares of 2024 and instead choosing to prioritize their debt reduction with the recent acquisition of Seagen. The company\u2019s $4 billion cost-saving initiative, which is intended to restore operating margins to pre-COVID levels, emphasizes the company\u2019s dedication to increasing profitability even as its expenses rise. This strategy is backed by a very long-standing demand for their products. Which Pfizer expects to leverage for stable revenue growth. Pfizer\u2019s conservative capital allocation strategy shows a balance between reinvesting in growth and maintaining some flexibility to address future operational needs, signaling a focus on performance as the global health markets shift and evolve from a need for COVID-19 products to products focusing on oncology and many other things.\n\n**Pipeline Overview & Oncology Segment**\n\nPfizer's future expansion is mostly focused upon its late-stage oncology pipeline, especially since buying Seagen in 2023 to expand its targeted cancer therapies and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). ADC Sigvotatug vedotin for non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer medicines like PACDEV with KEYTRUDA, and breast cancer medications like abemaciclib and PF-07248144 are important assets. Pfizer expects many regulatory submissions, anticipated peak sales of $10 billion from oncology by the late 2020s, and the further expansion of indications for well-known medications like IBRANCE and 56666 TULISA.\n\n**New Markets: Weight Loss Drugs**\u00a0\n\nPfizer has recently entered the weight loss drug market with Danuglipron, an oral glp-1 receptor agonist whose introduction is well timed as there is increasing demand in the market for prescription drugs for weight loss. Promising results have been experienced in the Phase 2 trials of Danuglipron, which also demonstrated a clinically significant placebo-adjusted loss of weight and ease of tolerating the drug. It remains to be seen whether this high rate of discontinuation of the treatment can be explained entirely by the broad range of gastrointestinal effects experienced. Pfizer has now prioritized a once-a-day modified-release version of Danuglipron that they hope to improve further in 2024. This formulation may lead to increased tolerability and improved patient adherence, hence presenting itself into a market characterized by injectables. In comparison to Eli Lilly's oral candidate and Astra's lower-rate offering, Pfizer hopes to launch funnel and Danuglipron in the next few years. Demand for weight loss medications is presently quite high owing to growing understanding of obesity's accompanying health threats as well as better treatment options resulting in considerable growth potential within the market. If approved, Danuglipron could offer a major source of revenue and allow time-poor patients a simpler oral method of taking GLP-1 medications , which represents a new strategy for companies like Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, who currently lead in the market.\u00a0\n\n**Capital Allocation & Debt Reduction Strategy**\n\nIn Pfizer\u2019s strategic shift toward long-term growth, capital allocation and debt reduction have become critical focal points. Following its recent acquisition of Seagen, Pfizer has prioritized lowering its debt, demonstrating a cautious approach to capital management. Rather than share repurchases, Pfizer has opted to channel resources into reducing its debt burden, a move designed to strengthen its balance sheet and enhance financial flexibility. This approach is supported by the company\u2019s $4 billion cost-saving initiative aimed at improving operating margins, which aligns with the goal of achieving greater profitability in a post-COVID revenue landscape. By prioritizing debt reduction, Pfizer not only bolsters investor confidence but also positions itself to reinvest in key growth areas, especially in oncology and other high-potential therapeutic areas.\n\n**Dividend Policy and Shareholder Returns**\n\nIn Pfizer\u2019s most recent quarterly report, they expressed their goal of bolstering the shareholder value as much as possible. They prioritize increasing the number of share buybacks, reducing the company\u2019s debt, and improving the value of their dividends. Dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the price of the shares. This metric communicates what percentage of the share price the dividend is. A higher dividend yield indicates that the company's dividends are worth the share's price. Pfizer\u2019s current dividend yield is 6.00%, which is higher than average. As of the YTD, the annual dividend is $4.96, and the dividend of the recent quarter is $0.42. In the past two quarters, Pfizer has spent $273.04 on share buybacks. These share buybacks increase the value of a Pfizer share which benefits current investors. Based on recent company goals, the amount of shares repurchased by the company will increase. Investors can maximize their profit by investing as soon as possible, as Pfizer\u2019s dividend policy benefits income investors due to the dividends the company distributes each quarter. When compared to peer companies like Johnson and Johnson, Novo Nordisk, and AbbVie Inc, Pfizer has the highest dividend yield and payout ratio, making it the optimal company to invest in.\n\n**Research and Development Focus in Oncology**\n\nPfizer\u2019s oncology efforts are led by innovative treatments such as Elranatamab, known as Elrexfio. Approved last year, Elrexifo targets patients that suffer from a rare and incurable blood cancer that affects myeloma cells. This disease currently impacts around 160,000 people worldwide and accumulates around 34,000 new diagnoses annually in the U.S. alone. Elrexifo aims to extend the amount of time patients have before their condition worsens. According to The Independent, the treatment was recently endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK. It is estimated by NICE themselves that about 700 people will benefit from this recommendation. It will only help a handful of patients because of the restrictions that reduce accessibility, however, efforts are underway to broaden its reach. Globally, Elrexifo is a key contributor of Pfizer\u2019s projected oncology sales, which totaled over $12 billion in 2023. So far, their oncology revenue, combined with that of non-COVID products, has totaled over $13.6 billion in Q3 2024. These products are seeing a growth rate of 14% compared to last year. Aside from Elrexifo, Pfizer also intends to boost its oncology sector by investing in next-gen cancer therapies like immuno-oncology, further researching potential cancer treatments, and striking partnerships with biotech firms. These factors suggest a promising future for Pfizer\u2019s role in oncology, making the company a compelling investment opportunity going forward, even with COVID out of the picture.\n\n**Competitive Landscape in Weight Loss Market**\n\nPfizer\u2019s entry into the weight loss drug market with Danuglipron provides it with a foothold against key competitors like Eli Lilly. Danuglipron\u2019s oral formulation offers a unique advantage in a field dominated by injectables, potentially boosting patient adherence. While competitors like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk hold substantial market shares, Pfizer's innovation in GLP-1 delivery could capture significant demand, especially if its modified-release formulation proves successful.\n\n**Profitability Metrics & Investor Appeal**\n\nPfizer\u2019s profitability metrics reveal a mixed picture for long-term investors. While its gross profit and operating income are substantial, translating into a gross profit of $42.68 billion this year with a $4.2 billion net income, profitability ratios such as ROE (declining at 28%) and ROIC (14%) signal potential weaknesses in value generation for shareholders. Additionally, Pfizer\u2019s profitability score is a modest 58/100, trailing behind competitors like Johnson & Johnson, Roche, and Eli Lilly, which have higher scores and better net income margins despite lower gross profits. Pfizer\u2019s EBITDA margins reflect solid cash-generating ability, but declining profitability metrics suggest a need to boost efficiency or reduce costs to enhance returns. Pfizer\u2019s forward dividend yield, which appeals to income-focused investors, remains a strong draw, yet the declining ROE and ROIC may lessen its attractiveness as a sustainable long-term investment compared to its more efficient peers.\n\n**Valuation Analysis**\n\nTwo factors that can be used to conduct an in-depth analysis for the valuation of Pfizer are forward EBITDA and PEG ratios. These can be used to compare Pfizer to industry standards. Currently, their EBITDA margin benchmark against competitors is 30.7%. Pfizer is relatively higher compared to industry standards, emphasizing strong profitability. Additionally, Pfizer\u2019s PEG ratio is 1.47. Compared to industry standards, Pfizer is well exceeding in this category reflecting how it could be potentially overvalued. Therefore, their current valuation reflects strong growth potential according to EBITDA but questionable growth potential according to PEG ratios. In addition, Pfizer\u2019s stance in the healthcare industry allows them to dominate but also provides risks as their COVID-19- revenue is slowly declining. Ultimately, Pfizer's strong EBITDA margin and dominant industry position make it a unique portfolio addition, as it offers stability and growth potential despite concerns over COVID-19 revenue decline and a high PEG ratio.\n\n**Conclusion: Investment Thesis/ TLDR**\n\nBuy: Pfizer\u2019s strong Q3 growth, high dividend, and strategic focus on cancer and weight loss treatments make it a stable, income-friendly investment with solid long-term potential.\n\n",

Commenters suggest diversifying into index funds or bond funds, considering the tax implications of selling stocks, and caution against over-reliance on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios due to its high cash allocation. Some recommend exploring municipal bonds for tax efficiency and using a more conservative investment strategy given my financial situation.*\n\nWhat I've started the process of doing is moving some of the cash to VOO, VXUS and VXF at a 50/25/25 split.  I feel confident with that mix and my goal of turning this $5M into $10M in \\~10 years seems possible.  That just leaves the stocks and figuring out how to best convert those over into the 3 funds.  Am I right in assuming that there is really no real trick to this other than to sale them at the rate of taxes I'm willing to incur each year?  Much of the AAPL and TSLA holdings are profit so they are gonna hit me the hardest.  If I'm right in that assumption - what not just pull the bandaid off and do them all now?  Is there any real benefit to doing them over several years?  I don't plan on selling everything, but do want to move the bulk of stuff to those 3 funds.",

        "selftext": "https://www.wired.com/story/trump-us-cloud-services-europe/\n\n\n#Trump\u2019s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants\n\n###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won\u2019t be easy.\n\n> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti\u2013Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.\n\n> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies\u2019 cloud services\u2014including servers, storage, and databases\u2014citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.\n\n> \u201cThere\u2019s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,\u201d says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford\u2019s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.\n\n> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become \u201cmore technologically independent\u201d and saying the status quo creates \u201csecurity and reliability risks.\u201d\n\n> Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks\u2014with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.\n\n> \u201cWe have more demand from across Europe,\u201d says Mathias N\u00f6bauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. \u201cSome customers were very explicit,\u201d N\u00f6bauer says. \u201cEspecially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.\u201d\n\n> \u201cIt's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans\u2019 perspective\u2014that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,\u201d says Joakim \u00d6hman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. \u201cThose are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.\u201d\n\n> Concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people\u2019s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, \u00d6hman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.\n\n> Dave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company\u2019s few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. \u201cFirst and foremost, it\u2019s about values,\u201d Cottlehuber says. \u201cFor me, privacy is a right not a privilege.\u201d Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. \u201cThe best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers\u2019 privacy is respected and preserved,\u201d Cottlehuber says.\n\n> Steffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always \u201cbeen a must,\u201d but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. \u201cSince the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,\u201d Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to N\u00f6bauer\u2019s Exoscale.\n\n> Harry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is \u201cnot accurate\u201d that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. \u201cOur customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,\u201d Straight says. \u201cAWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.\u201d Staight says the membership of the PCLOB \u201cdoes not impact\u201d the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has \u201cadditional safeguards for cloud content.\u201d Google and Microsoft declined to comment.\n\n> The potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the European Alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. \u201cWe can certainly feel that something is going on,\u201d Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has \u201cbeaten\u201d the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. \u201cThis is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,\u201d he says.\n\n> While there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small\u2014at least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services\u2014such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing\u2014from the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. \u201cWhat happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,\u201d he says.\n\n> For years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon\u2019s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.\n\n> \u201cIf you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you\u2019ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,\u201d says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered. Hubert has argued that it is no longer \u201csafe\u201d for European governments to be moved to US clouds and that European alternatives can\u2019t properly compete. \u201cWe sell a lot of fine wood here in Europe. But not that much furniture,\u201d he says. However, that too could change.\n\n> Schaake, the former member of the European Parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a Europe-first approach or investing in a European technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. \u201cThe dramatic shift of the Trump administration is very tangible,\u201d Schaake says. \u201cThe idea that anything could happen and that Europe should fend for itself is clear. Now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.\u201d\n\n**Credit:** *(Matt Burgess is a senior writer at WIRED focused on information security, privacy, and data regulation in Europe.

        "selftext": "https://www.newsweek.com/trump-threatens-barbie-100-percent-tariff-2070023\n\n> President Donald Trump has threatened to place a 100 percent tariff on Barbie maker Mattel, after the company's CEO said it would continue to manufacture outside the U.S. but would be reducing its reliance on Chinese imports. \"I've heard [Mattel] said: 'Well we're going to go counter, we're going to try going someplace else,' \" Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday. \"That's OK, let him go, and we'll put a 100 percent tariff on his toys, and he won't sell one toy in the United States, and that's their biggest market.\" Trump's threat to Mattel comes as toys\u2014in particular dolls\u2014have emerged as a flashpoint in the ongoing debates over tariffs and his administration's trade policy.\n\n> Trump and his cabinet have downplayed the issue's significance, with the president himself repeatedly stating that girls will be better off for having fewer dolls, and now threatening tariffs on one of the world's most iconic doll manufacturers.\n\n> During the company's first-quarter earnings call, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said the tariff-driven price hike was one of the three \"mitigating actions\" the company had been forced to take in response to the tariffs, alongside a reduction in its dependence on China-sourced products and a broader diversification of its supply chain. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Kreiz was asked whether it would be cheaper to relocate some manufacturing to the U.S. due to the tariffs, but responded: \"We don't see that happening.\" \"We believe that production in other countries\u2014where we can be efficient and more productive\u2014is the best balance between manufacturing outside of the U.S. and [continuing] to develop product in terms of design and creativity in America,\" he said. In response to the price increases, and similar announcements made by car manufacturer Ford this week, Trump said: \"I think they're saying that just to negotiate deals with me.\"\n\n> Trump's remark on Mattel \"trying to go somewhere else,\" and the resulting threat of a targeted, 100 percent tariff on its toys was somewhat ambiguous, given the company has only advocated shifting more of its manufacturing outside of China.",

        "title": "Trump Calls for End to $52 Billion Chips Act Subsidy Program",
        "selftext": ">President Donald Trump called for ending a bipartisan $52 billion semiconductor subsidy program that\u2019s spurred more than $400 billion in investments from companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp.\n\n>\u201cYour Chips Act is a horrible, horrible thing,\u201d the president said in a prime-time address to Congress on Tuesday. Trump implored US House Speaker Mike Johnson to get rid of the legislation and use \u201cwhatever is left over\u201d to \u201creduce debt or any other reason.\u201d\n\n>His remarks were met with applause in a chamber that passed the Chips and Science Act less than three years ago. Vice President JD Vance, whose home state of Ohio won a massive Intel project thanks to the law, stood up to show his support for its revocation.\n\n>The Chips Act is among the most significant US forays into industrial policy in more than a generation. It set aside $39 billion in grants \u2014 plus loans and 25% tax breaks \u2014 to revitalize American semiconductor manufacturing, as well as $11 billion for chip research and development. The aim was to reduce reliance on Asia for electronic components that power everything from smartphones to massive data centers.\n\n>Trump, however, has consistently derided a program he regards as a waste of government funds, arguing tariffs would achieve the same outcome while filling coffers. Republicans have also indicated that they want to repeal what they see as \u201csocial\u201d provisions of the Chips Act. That could involve eliminating labor-friendly regulations or environmental requirements.\n\n>Officials on both sides of the aisle have touted the Chips Act as crucial to US national and economic security, and Trump could have a hard time getting congressional support to repeal it. Dozens of GOP lawmakers voted for the measure, and many red districts have won factories or other projects supported by the law.\n\n>That includes South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc., which have committed to multibillion-dollar projects in Texas and Indiana that were contingent on funding and support from the US government. Company representatives declined to comment on the president\u2019s remarks.\n\n>Trump, favoring tariffs over incentives, has signaled that import levies on chips could come as soon as next month. Companies can avoid those duties, he has said, by building factories on American soil. He has not offered additional details.\n\n>On Monday, Trump credited the tariff threats for TSMC\u2019s decision to invest $100 billion in the US, on top of a previous $65 billion commitment. He touted that project in his address Tuesday, referencing the full $165 billion figure. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them no money,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAll that was important to them was they didn\u2019t want to pay the tariffs.\u201d\n\n>A TSMC spokesperson declined to comment.\n\n>The company originally announced plans for a $12 billion US site during Trump\u2019s first term and expanded that project to three factories under Biden. To support those facilities, TSMC struck an agreement with Biden officials for $6.6 billion in Chips Act grants and $5 billion in loans.\n\n>As is the case for other Chips Act awards, the funding is supposed to be disbursed over time, as TSMC hits negotiated project milestones. The company received $1.5 billion before Biden left office.\n\n>Trump did not specify whether he would attempt to claw back money that\u2019s already been disbursed, renege on remaining incentives to which the government has already committed, or simply not provide additional support for the chipmaker\u2019s latest investment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Monday that the newly announced projects \u2014 three additional chip plants, plus R&D and advanced packaging sites \u2014 won\u2019t win federal funds.\n\n>\u201cThe main uncertainty is the future of TSMC,\u201d said Xin-Yao Ng, an investment director at abrdn plc. \u201cOne long-time competitive advantage was their clustering in Taiwan, where labor costs are still reasonable, construction costs are cheaper, government is supportive, and they can find more workers with vocational training. It\u2019s completely different in the US if they are to shift more manufacturing. Subsidies from US were to be crucial to help mitigate some of the higher costs and challenges.\u201d\n\n>TSMC is among 20 companies that reached binding Chips Act agreements with Biden officials. The deals, which represent more than 85% of the manufacturing incentives available under the program, are designed to support leading-edge facilities by companies like TSMC, Intel, Samsung and Micron Technology Inc. \u2014 as well as older-generation factories by the likes of GlobalFoundries Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.\n\n>Companies have generally viewed those agreements as ironclad \u2014 regardless of who\u2019s in office. But some of them have worried that the Trump administration could seek to modify the terms, Bloomberg has reported. Lutnick has said he cannot commit to honoring existing contracts without reviewing them first.\n\n>That review is ongoing, and Lutnick\u2019s intentions for the initiative remain unclear. So far, his questions to program staff have focused on the rationale behind award decisions and the government\u2019s legal authority to claw money back, Bloomberg has reported. The current Chips Act team, meanwhile, has been preparing a list of potential adjustments to the funding application process and final contracts that would be minimally disruptive.\n\n>A spokesperson for GlobalWafers Co., which won $406 million from the Chips Act for factories in Texas and Missouri, said the Taiwanese company is committed to its expansion strategy and views any changes to the Chips Act as \u201cunlikely.\u201d\n\n>But if the law were to be modified in some way, the spokesperson said, \u201cwe would reassess future investments, including evaluating US market demand, pricing, and potential tariffs if production were moved outside the US.\u201d\n\n**My take:** Brutally bad for semiconductor sector if CHIPS is actually repealed, INTC is especially targeted. There'd be less semiconductor manufacturing in the US (INTC/TSM/Samsung) primarily because we subsidize and have tax incentives for current US chip manfacturing projects, and companies that haven't received their funding will likely scale back projects [(remember INTC delayed their Ohio plant to 2028?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j0cq51/intel_delays_28_billion_ohio_chip_factory_in_new/). The US would also be far more dependent on semiconductor production overseas. \n\nThis also has spillover into the quantum computing stocks (IONQ/RGTI) and AI sector due to the sectors being so reliant on technological development and supply from the semis sectors.\n\nOverall don't think new tariffs are going to be an adequate replacement for what the US has committed so far (but we don't know much about  the tariffs yet), and the markets hate uncertainty.\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-calls-for-end-to-52-billion-chips-act-subsidy-program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-calls-for-end-to-52-billion-chips-act-subsidy-program)",

        "selftext": "India's antitrust body has asked Reliance Industries and Walt Disney around 100 questions linked to their $8.5 billion India media assets merger, including details on sports rights as it heightens its scrutiny of the deal, two sources told Reuters.\n\nAntitrust experts had warned that the Reliance and Disney deal, which was announced in February, could face intense scrutiny as it will create India's biggest entertainment player with 120 TV channels and two streaming services.\n\nThe companies will also together own lucrative rights for cricket, India's most popular sport.\n\nIn a confidential submission to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in May, the companies said their merger would not hurt the competition, and argued that cricket rights will expire in 2027 and 2028 and allow bidding by rivals, and advertisers can target cricket-watching consumers on many rival platforms including YouTube, Reuters reported in May.\n\nThe CCI has now sought more details via two sets of questions, including why YouTube - which mostly has free, user-generated content - should be treated in the same market as subscription streaming services like Netflix and Disney, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nReliance and Disney have responded to the CCI questions and argued YouTube too has its own licensed, paid content as well as a wide reach, said the sources, who declined to be named as the information is confidential.\n\nData from Media Partners Asia last year showed that YouTube accounted for 88% of the online video market in India, while the premium video market of 12% is dominated by streaming services which \"curate premium long-form content\".\n\nReliance-Disney will also own digital and TV cricket rights worth billions of dollars for top cricket tournaments as well as for the Wimbledon tennis championship, which has raised more antitrust concerns.\n\nThe CCI has also asked the companies details on which entity owns which sports rights and for how long, as well as information on who had bid for them previously.\n\n\"The CCI is so far not raising concerns on the rights but is gathering information,\" said one of the sources.\n\nThe requests for so much information could be because of the large size of the deal, said the first source. The second source, however, said the CCI was asking an unusually large number of questions.\n\nReliance, which is led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and the CCI did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Disney declined to comment. The CCI is still reviewing the merger.\n\nIf it closes, the Reliance-Disney deal will reshape India's $28 billion entertainment market where Zee Entertainment and Sony also operate.\n\nJefferies estimates Disney-Reliance will command 40% of the advertising market share in the TV and streaming segments.\n\nSource: https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/india-sends-100-antitrust-queries-092540877.html",

        "title": "Tesla Bull and Bear case: the great AI and liability gamble",
        "selftext": "Tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently, nearly doubling to $1.4T market cap in just three months. The catalyst is Trump\u2019s victory and Elon Musk\u2019s instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon\u2019s influence to relax regulations, clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout\u2014a potential game-changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole.\n\nTesla is trading like an AI startup, and for good reason: its \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d (FSD) system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look.  \n\n\n# The Bull Case: Tesla\u2019s data volume\n\nTesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road, each equipped with a suite of cameras, Tesla\u2019s fleet constantly collects real-world driving data. This data acts as a \u201cshadow trainer\u201d for its AI, gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile, FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI, providing Tesla with even more labeled data.\n\nBehind the scenes, Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases\u2014rare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly, Tesla\u2019s massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume, which usually means better machine learning.On top of this, Tesla\u2019s vision-only approach\u2014using cameras without lidar\u2014makes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result? A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world, not just pre-mapped areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n# The Bear Case: Quantity vs. Quality\n\nMore data is not always better, and it\u2019s possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments, where edge cases are relatively rare, while Waymo trains their AI in dense, chaotic urban areas.\u00a0 The result is a more diverse dataset that\u2019s constantly evolving.\n\nWaymo is owned by Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar.\u00a0 Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out, but failed, to do.\u00a0 Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of, since it often conflicted with the vision data.\u00a0 But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work.\u00a0 This means that its data is much richer in quality.\u00a0 The urban-focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla\u2019s suburban-heavy dataset, giving its AI a potentially richer training environment.\n\nThe geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre-mapped areas, Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real-world deployments today. Tesla, by comparison, is still at Level 2, which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn\u2019t just an incremental step\u2014it\u2019s an order-of-magnitude leap in complexity.\n\nTesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments\u2014places like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla\u2019s FSD, by contrast, collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases, such as jaywalking pedestrians, aggressive lane merges, and unexpected construction detours.\n\nAs the saying goes, \u201cIf you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.\u201d If Waymo\u2019s AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA, it\u2019s far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast, Tesla\u2019s suburban data might create a \u201csame-shit-different-day\u201d scenario, where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare, high-stakes scenarios.\n\n# Regulatory relaxation is a double-edged sword\n\nIf Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations, Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory, this could limit Tesla\u2019s liability, especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However, accidents involving unsuspecting third parties (e.g., pedestrians) remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks, manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles, meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure, even for a small number of accidents.\u00a0 Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework, courts ultimately determine liability, and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best, complicity at worst.\n\nTesla\u2019s data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics\u2014which is very impressive. However, publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because, again, L2 puts the onus on the driver.  But it's a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case, any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla, exposing them to unlimited liability.\n\n# The scalability myth\n\nTesla bulls often criticize Waymo\u2019s reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable, but this argument doesn\u2019t hold weight for two reasons.\u00a0 First, lidar is becoming much cheaper, and with volume production, costs could approach Tesla\u2019s camera-only system.\u00a0 Ironically, Elon\u2019s first principles philosophy should be applied here: just because something was a certain way before doesn\u2019t mean it has to be that way.\u00a0 Secondly, the market for taxis in general is urban.\u00a0 When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside?\u00a0 Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed, giving it a more focused path to profitability.\n\n\n\n# Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google\n\nWaymo uses millions of AI-generated simulations to train its system. It\u2019s AI teaching AI, similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations, but Waymo\u2019s superior compute power (via Google\u2019s custom TPUs) means it\u2019s clearly dominant in this regard.\n\nTesla bulls often cite Elon\u2019s dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla\u2019s superior approach. But they overlook Google\u2019s hegemony in AI.\u00a0 They were in the game before anyone.\u00a0 They delivered AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and many other paradigm-shifting, world-changing products, backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla\u2019s Dojo may be promising, but it\u2019s still a newbie.  \n  \n\n\n# tl;dr\n\nTesla\u2019s $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving, which is to say its lead in AI.\u00a0 If Tesla dominates AI, the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality, liability risks, and Waymo\u2019s technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind.  In which case, it's vastly overvalued.  \n\n\nFull disclosure: I'm currently short the stock. That could change if the price goes down.  \n\n\n",

        "selftext": "**Key Points**\n\n* Tariff proposals have put the complex global supply chain front and center as President-elect Donald Trump gets inaugurated on Monday.\n* On the campaign trail, Trump said he would add tariffs for goods made in other countries, especially China.\n* Those higher costs on sneakers, cars, furniture and more could force many consumers to change their buying habits.\n\n**Tickers mentioned in this article: MAT, ELF, STLA, GM, F, TGT,  KTB, TAP, STZ, GOOS, LAMB**\n\n>Many of the items that U.S. shoppers browse and buy in retailers\u2019 aisles\u00a0come from far-away factories or farms\u00a0\u2014 a reality that could soon force many consumers to change their buying habits.\n\n>Sneakers, T-shirts, beer and other common household items are often made in countries like China, Mexico and Canada before they wind their way to a big-box retailer, grocer or mall in the U.S. That complex global supply chain is front and center Monday as President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0gets\u00a0inaugurated\u00a0and is widely expected to announce new tariffs on imports.\n\n>While tariffs have become a familiar concept for more Americans since Trump implemented them on metals and other key materials during his first term in office, the levies he has threatened for his return to the White House could have a much bigger effect on household budgets.\n\n>Most people have little grasp of just how many items could see price hikes due to the duties: from avocados to children\u2019s toys, to chocolate and cars, experts told CNBC. Proposed tariffs on products from China, Mexico and Canada \u2014 the three largest U.S. trading partners \u2014 would likely affect U.S. consumers the most.\n\n>The exact details of those tariffs, including which countries would be affected and how high the\u00a0duties\u00a0might be, remain unclear\u00a0and could change. On the campaign trail, Trump spoke about implementing 10% to 20% tariffs on all countries, and\u00a0putting levies as high as 60% on Chinese goods.\n\n>While\u00a0news reports\u00a0in recent weeks have suggested Trump could\u00a0scale back his tariff proposals, and could be using them as a negotiating tactic to bend foreign governments to his will, the president-elect has denied those reports.\n\n>Since his first run for president, Trump has argued tariffs will encourage more manufacturing in the U.S. and promote job creation and national security. It\u2019s not just him: President Joe Biden and other Democrats have backed more limited tariffs for the same reasons.\n\n>Regardless, the risk is clear for retailers: Any tariffs would bring extra costs they\u2019d have to absorb, share with producers or pass on to customers by charging higher prices\u00a0*\u2014*\u00a0the latter of which is the most likely scenario as the industry is reluctant to sacrifice profits, retail executives and industry experts told CNBC in recent weeks. Major retail trade groups, including the National Retail Federation and Consumer Technology Association, have warned tariffs would effectively become a tax on American businesses and consumers.\n\n>Shoppers are already expecting tariffs to hit their pocketbooks. About 67% U.S. adults surveyed said they think it is very likely or somewhat likely that companies will pass on the cost of tariffs to consumers,\u00a0according to Morning Consult survey\u00a0of more than 4,400 people in early December. Even so, the same poll found about 45% of adults back a 10% tariff on all imports, and more than a third of respondents support a 20% duty on all goods and a 60% levy on Chinese imports.\n\n>Ali Furman, consumer markets industry leader for PwC, said tariffs have become the number one topic of discussion among companies working with the consulting firm, and the conversations have reached the top of the C-suite. She said the tariff fallout could be different now than during Trump\u2019s first term, since his new proposal is broader and comes as retailers struggle to convince inflation-weary consumers to spend.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s not 2017,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause there\u2019s a more cost-conscious consumer, you have to be much more thoughtful about passing on those costs to the consumer.\u201d\n\n>\u201cAt the same time, you don\u2019t want to come across as anti-tariff or anti-American,\u201d she added.\n\n>Planning for tariffs now is challenging because companies do not know how Trump will proceed. Automotive executives who have spoken with CNBC in recent weeks said they are preparing for several different scenarios but not making any moves until there\u2019s more clarity.\n\n>\u201cWe are working, obviously, on scenarios,\u201d Antonio Filosa, head of Stellantis\u2019 North American operations, said. \u201cBut yes, we need to await his decisions and after the decision of Mr. Trump and his administration, we will work accordingly.\u201d\n\n>Professor Brett House, an economist from Columbia Business School, said just about every consumer product could see a price increase under the proposals, but some companies have higher exposure than others\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n>\u201cSomething around\u00a050% of U.S. petroleum imports come from Canada. The Trump administration puts tariffs on those, it is unequivocally the case that everything in the United States will become substantially more expensive,\u201d House told CNBC in an interview. \u201cThe breadth of the impact that we should expect to see from these tariffs could be enormous and could affect every single thing we produce in the United States and every household and every business. No one will be immune.\u201d\n\n>Here are just some of the everyday items that would be affected if duties on goods from China, Canada and Mexico take effect.\n\n>**China: Sneakers, furniture and toys**\n\n>Within closets, living rooms and children\u2019s playrooms, a range of American household goods originate in China.\n\n>The country is the largest furniture exporter on the globe, according to data from the Home Furnishings Association, a trade group that lobbies on behalf of home goods retailers. In 2023, $32.4 billion in furniture was imported into the U.S., 29% of which came from China, followed close behind by Vietnam, which accounted for 26.5% of imports, according to the HFA, which cited investment banking firm Mann, Armistead & Epperson \u2013 one of the furniture industry\u2019s top sources for data. Between 30% and 40% of furniture is produced in the U.S., but as much as 50% of raw materials \u2013 like wood, fabrics, hinges and screws \u2013 are imported, making price increases on home products difficult to avoid, even if they\u2019re technically \u201cmade in America.\u201d\n\n>HFA CEO Shannon Williams said home goods retailers cannot withstand a 60% tariff on China imports and would likely have to move supply chains if Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs went into effect. While tables and couches likely would not cost 60% more, their prices would still rise, said Williams.\n\n>If companies redirected supply chains to Vietnam, where many manufacturers fled during Trump\u2019s first administration, retailers could still face tariffs of 10% to 20% \u2013 plus the cost of moving and scaling operations. The tariffs alone could make a $2,000 couch cost as much as $2,200 to $2,400.\n\n>If businesses moved operations to Mexico, which accounted for about 10% of U.S. furniture imports in 2023, a $2,000 couch could cost up to 25% more at $2,500.\n\n>When Trump first announced tariff increases, some industry experts suggested that retailers might eat some of that cost and try to pass some on to the manufacturer to prevent big price hikes for consumers.\n\n>Between 2018 and 2019, when Trump introduced 10% tariffs on certain goods during his first administration, furniture prices increased by about 2.3%, according to the HFA, which cited data from the consumer price index.\n\n>This time around, the tariffs are not only higher, but also the home goods sector is struggling, leaving it less equipped to absorb the cost. Covid-era purchasing, high interest rates and a sluggish housing market have made it a \u201crough couple years\u201d for the industry, said Williams.\n\n>Beyond furniture, consumers could see another everyday item cost more if higher tariffs take effect: toys.\n\n>Around 80% of toys imported to the U.S. come from China, and the cost of toys made outside of the U.S. could increase by up to 56% under Trump\u2019s proposals, according to the Toy Association, a trade group that lobbies on behalf of the industry.\n\n>That would make a $20 Barbie doll, which has historically been manufactured in China, cost as much as $31.20.\n\n>\u201cIf this were to happen, parents could be pushed to buy less expensive, non-compliant toys from unsanctioned, online sellers. These toys often do not meet U.S. safety and quality standards and could be toxic and dangerous to children, putting them at risk,\u201d the Toy Association said in an email to CNBC. \u201cToys produced by the U.S. toy industry are compliant with rigorous safety and quality standards, and we hope they will remain affordable to American families and not subject to tariffs.\u201d As of the end of 2023, about 50% of toys from Barbie\u2019s parent company Mattel were made in China, according to CEO Ynon Kreiz. This year, Mattel expects less than 40% of its sourcing to come from China so its \u201cexposure in the U.S. to China sourcing is therefore 20%\u201d given the company\u2019s geographic sales mix, Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro said.\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019ve done a good job mitigating the potential exposure,\u201d DiSilvestro said during a Morgan Stanley retail conference in December. \u201cBut to the extent we\u2019re impacted, we would expect to raise prices to offset it.\u201d\n\n>Footwear is another industry with a heavy reliance on China. About 37% of footwear imports came from the country in 2023, followed by about 30% from Vietnam, nearly 9% from Italy and 8% from Indonesia, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission\n\n>Nearly 100% of all footwear is imported to the U.S., according to the group.\n\n>Even before Trump\u2019s first term, footwear manufacturers were moving some sourcing out of China as its labor force shrank, the organization\u2019s CEO Matt Priest said. Yet he said it would be unrealistic to return production to the U.S., and moving it to another part of Asia can be difficult.\n\n>Already, some companies have accelerated their plans. Steve Madden said in November that it will reduce the goods it imports from China by as much as 45% over the next year.\n\n>At a press conference on Thursday, Priest said U.S. footwear companies are waiting for clearer policy.\n\n>\u201cAll of these actions are inflationary,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to pay the piper somewhere.\u201d\n\n>China isn\u2019t a major manufacturer of cosmetics, but E.l.f. Beauty , a drugstore staple and popular brand among younger shoppers, makes about 80% of its makeup in the region.\n\n>During an interview with CNBC late last year, CEO Tarang Amin said the company could be forced to raise prices if the tariff hikes take effect \u2014 a risky move considering its low prices are one of its main draws.\n\n>**Mexico: Cars, beer and avocados**\n\n>Over the last decade, U.S. consumers have developed a bigger appetite for avocados and Mexican beers. They\u2019ve also gotten used to buying cars from major U.S. automakers with a lot of manufacturing in Mexico.\n\n>Tariffs on Mexican imports could endanger those habits, particularly for price-sensitive shoppers.\n\n>Most major automakers have factories in the U.S. However, they still heavily rely on imports from other countries including Mexico to meet American consumer demand.\n\n>Under the North American Free Trade Agreement and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that replaced it, automakers increasingly looked to Mexico as a less expensive place to produce vehicles than in the U.S. or Canada.\n\n>Nearly every major automaker operating in the U.S. has at least one plant in Mexico, including the top six-selling automakers that accounted for more than 70% of U.S. sales in 2024.\n\n>The industry is deeply integrated between the countries, with Mexico importing 49.4% of all auto parts from the U.S. In turn, Mexico exports 86.9% of its auto parts production to the U.S., according to the International Trade Administration.\n\n>Wells Fargo estimates that 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada imports would put most of the adjusted earnings of General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis at risk. The firm estimates the impact of 5%, 10% and 25% tariffs to be $13 billion, $25 billion and $56 billion, respectively, across the three companies.\n\n>Most notably, GM and Stellantis both have massive plants in Mexico that produce highly profitable full-size pickup trucks. They, along with Ford and others, also have built EVs in Mexico to lower costs.\n\n>Mexico is also home to the top-selling beer in the U.S. In 2023, Constellation Brands\u2019 Modelo overtook the crown from Bud Light. Constellation also owns Corona, which ranks in the top 10 U.S. beer brands, and fast-growing Pacifico.\n\n>All of the company\u2019s beer brands are imported from Mexico, and beer accounted for 85% of the company\u2019s sales in the first three quarters of its fiscal year.\n\n>If Trump implements the tariffs, Constellation\u2019s cost of goods sold would rise by roughly 16%, according to estimates from Wells Fargo Securities.\n\n>The company would likely choose to offset the levies by raising prices, because moving production doesn\u2019t seem like an option due to a 2013 antitrust settlement. Constellation has spent billions of dollars in recent years to expand its Mexican production capacity.\n\n>On the company\u2019s latest earnings conference call, Constellation CEO Bill Newlands said \u201cit\u2019s really too early to hypothesize\u201d about how the tariffs will play out.\n\n>\u201cAs you would expect, we have a lot of permutations that we have considered and certainly we\u2019ll adjust our approach depending on what plays out as we go forward,\u201d he told analysts on Jan. 10.\n\n>Uncertainty about tariffs has led a number of Wall Street analysts to downgrade Constellation\u2019s stock since Trump announced his intention to reignite a trade war with Mexico.\n\n>Avocados have proven less easy to substitute than beers.\n\n>The fruit, once a rare sight in U.S. grocery stores, has become a staple of produce displays, thanks to the growing popularity of Mexican food and diets that call for \u201chealthy fats.\u201d\n\n>From June 2023 to June 2024, the U.S. imported more than 2.4 billion pounds of Mexican Hass avocados.\n\n>In the U.S., avocados are grown in California, Florida and Hawaii. But roughly 90% of the avocados eaten in the U.S. are grown in Mexico, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.\n\n>The country is one of the few places that can produce the fruit year round, ensuring that consumers can eat avocado toast in the summer and guacamole on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\n>Over the years, avocado consumers have proven that they are willing to pay more for the fruit. While avocado demand has roughly doubled over the last decade, prices have also climbed.\n\n>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like an avocado ... There are times of the year that yes, our prices go a little bit higher, but I feel like that is also part of the norm with our consumers. We don\u2019t see a great dip in our consumption when those prices are a little bit higher,\u201d Alvaro Luque, CEO of the nonprofit Avocados from Mexico, told CNBC.\n\n>Chipotle Mexican Grill famously charges a premium for adding guacamole, but the chain\u2019s customers have largely shrugged off price increases across its menu over the last few years. The burrito chain is one of the few restaurant companies that reported traffic growth quarter after quarter last year.\n\n>Outside of avocados and cars, some companies make clothing in Mexico, too. Kontoor Brands , for example, has turned to the region to make some of its Wrangler jeans. While some of its denim currently retails for about $60 at Macy\u2019s, that could rise to as much as $75 with tariffs factored in.\n\n>**Canada: Cars, coats and French fries Tariffs on Canadian goods would be another blow for automakers and car buyers. French fries and winter coats also risk getting pricier for consumers.**\n\n>Canada exported $27 billion of cars in 2022, trailing only crude petroleum as its top export, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.\n\n>Tariffs on Canadian vehicles would impact Detroit automakers the most, but there would likely be consequences across the industry depending on changes to parts from suppliers such as Canada-based Magna. Ontario Premier Doug Ford and other politicians and industry officials have described Trump\u2019s tariff proposal as an existential threat to the country\u2019s recovering automotive industry.\n\n>Five automakers \u2014 Ford, GM, Stellantis, Toyota Motor and Honda Motor \u2014 produced 1.54 million light-duty vehicles last year in the province, largely for U.S. consumers.\n\n>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer warned on Wednesday that potential 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada would harm the U.S. auto sector, increase vehicle prices and benefit China.\n\n>\u201cThink about this: 70% of all the auto parts we make in Michigan go directly to our neighbors. ... The only winner in that equation is China. They would love nothing more than to watch us cripple American\u2019s auto ecosystem all by ourselves. This is a matter of national security. We cannot let that happen,\u201d she said during a speech at the Detroit Auto Show.\n\n>But it wouldn\u2019t just be the auto industry that feels the pressure from Canadian tariffs.\n\n>Consider the humble French fry: Canada exports roughly $40.5 billion in agricultural goods to the U.S. annually, including $1.7 billion in frozen French fries and other frozen potato products, according to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the country\u2019s counterpart to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\n>Canada\u2019s frozen French fries largely come from McCain Foods. The Canadian family-owned company says that one out of every four fries eaten globally comes from its facilities. The company has seven Canadian factories and 11 in the U.S, according to its subsidiaries\u2019 websites.\n\n>As the last year has shown, consumers have grown more price sensitive at grocery stores and in fast-food drive-thru lanes, making it unlikely that they\u2019d swallow a price increase offsetting the tariff.\n\n>If Trump does implement steeper tariffs on Canadian goods, McCain could shift even more of its production to the U.S. Suppliers could jump ship to a U.S. rival like Lamb Weston. Luckily, many French fry suppliers, including the Idaho-based Lamb Weston, have expanded their capacity since the Covid pandemic.\n\n>**Tariffs on Canadian goods could also affect apparel.**\n\n>Canada Goose has built its reputation on high-end outerwear for chilly temperatures, made in Canada. About 70% of the retailer\u2019s merchandise is made in the country, and 30% is made in Europe at a factory that the company owns in Romania and at contractors in other parts of the continent.\n\n>A company spokesperson declined to comment on how Canada Goose is preparing for tariffs and whether it will increase prices.\n\nLink: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/20/trump-tariff-news-products-and-companies-most-at-risk.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/20/trump-tariff-news-products-and-companies-most-at-risk.html)",

        "title": "Trump Announces Chips, Drug Probes, Opening Door to Tariffs",
        "selftext": "[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-announces-chips-drug-probes-204108780.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-announces-chips-drug-probes-204108780.html)\n\n(Bloomberg) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s administration pressed forward with plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports by initiating probes led by the Commerce Department.\n\nThe moves, announced Monday in the Federal Register, are a precursor to imposing tariffs and threaten to broaden the president\u2019s sweeping US trade war.\n\nThe Commerce Department said it would be investigating the impact on US national security of \u201cimports of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment\u201d as well as \u201cpharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, including finished drug products\u201d in a pair of notices posted to the Federal Register.\n\nThe US president has long decried foreign production of drugs and chips as a threat to national security and threatened to slap tariffs on imports in a bid to revive American manufacturing of those products. But the duties could also wreak havoc on supply chains and drive up costs for Americans.\n\nNew levies threaten to roil a chips industry that notched more than $600 billion in global sales of chips essential to products ranging from cars to airplanes and mobile phones to consumer electronics. Semiconductor supply chains still feeling the effect of disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic now could face new strains from the US duties.\n\nThe administration\u2019s announcement came days after it exempted semiconductors, mobile phones, computers and other electronics imports from 145% duties applied to China. That announcement was seen as a boon to tech giants like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., but Trump and his advisers quickly said the relief would be short lived and that separate levies would be placed on chips.\n\nTariffs would also be a blow to the world\u2019s largest drugmakers, including Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly & Co., virtually all of which operate scores of manufacturing sites scattered across the globe.\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly bemoaned US drugmakers\u2019 reliance on overseas production, is breaking decades of tradition. The pharmaceutical industry has long side-stepped trade wars, protected by international agreements that largely protected medicines from tariffs on humanitarian grounds.\n\nTrump\u2019s move on semiconductors is similar to the way he\u2019s targeted other sectors, with imported steel, aluminum and automobiles already facing 25% tariffs and an ongoing Commerce Department trade probe expected to result in levies on foreign copper. The president has also vowed tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals and possibly critical minerals.\n\nUnder Biden, the US already had doubled tariffs on so-called legacy semiconductors from China to 50% and last December launched a probe into Chinese concentration in the category that sets the stage for Trump to impose even higher levies. While not as advanced as chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous in autos, airplanes, medical devices and telecommunications.\n\nTrump has cast reshoring chipmaking and revitalizing the US industrial base as essential for the nation\u2019s security. Winning a global race to dominate the AI industry is also a top Trump administration priority. Analysts have warned that bringing chip manufacturing to the US will take years of hard work work.\n\n**Worldwide Impact**\n\nThe move on medicines will have an outsize effect on Ireland, with a $54 billion (\u20ac47.6 billion) trade surplus with the US that helped spur Trump\u2019s wrath. The imbalance, heavily weighted by the pharmaceutical industry, stems from the country\u2019s favorable tax regime and highly educated workforce. US drug companies, including Lilly and Pfizer Inc., operate nearly two dozen factories in Ireland that ship drugs to the US, according to a TD Cowen analysis.\n\nThe US biotech industry, which drives much of the innovation in drug development, is also vulnerable to the new tariffs. Nearly 90% of American companies rely on imported components for US-approved products, according to a recent survey by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. As a result, the supply of medicines for US patients and families are particularly vulnerable to proposed tariffs on the European Union, China and Canada, the group wrote.\n\nNearly all of the companies surveyed said they expect manufacturing costs to surge if import tariffs are placed on the European Union. Half of the 42 companies said they\u2019d be forced to scramble for new research and manufacturing partners or they\u2019d need to rework or potentially delay regulatory filings for new products.\n\n\u201cRe-onshoring key parts of the biotechnology supply chain to the U.S. and our allies and strengthening the American manufacturing base should be a high priority for both national and economic security,\u201d BIO President John Crowley said in a statement. \u201cIt will take years, though, for this shift. We need to be mindful of the negative consequences of these proposed tariffs.\u201d\n\n**Trump\u2019s Exemptions**\n\nThe US president earlier Monday announced he would consider temporary reprieves from his 25% tariff on automotive imports to allow companies time to bring production to the US.\n\nThe announcement suggested that the president was willing to negotiate with industry leaders, and a similar push from technology and pharmaceutical executives is almost certain to follow.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to get this onshoring to happen as soon as possible and as orderly as possible,\u201d Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Monday on Fox Business. \u201cAnd so when he talks to CEOs and they say, \u2018Hey, I need a little more time with this, I need a little time more more time with that,\u2019 then he\u2019s absolutely willing to listen. And if he\u2019s convinced, then he\u2019ll make the call to do something like he did today.\u201d\n\nTrump was asked what short-lived product exclusions he was considering but did not specify how long a potential pause or lowering of auto levies would remain in place.",

        "selftext": "While the stock market broadly fared better on Monday than in the prior two trading days,\u00a0Apple\u00a0got hammered once again, losing 3.7%, as concerns mounted that the company will take a major hit from President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0tariffs.\n\nThe sell-off brings Apple\u2019s three-day rout to 19%, a downdraft that has wiped out $638 billion in market cap.\n\nApple is one of the most exposed companies to a trade war, analyst say, due largely to its reliance on China, which is facing 54% tariffs. Although Apple has production in India, Vietnam and Thailand, those countries also face increased tariffs as part of Trump\u2019s sweeping plan.\n\nAmong tech\u2019s\u00a0megacap companies, Apple is having the roughest stretch. On Monday, the only stocks to drop in that group of seven were Apple,\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0and\u00a0Tesla.\n\nThe Nasdaq finished almost barely up on Monday after plummeting 10% last week, its worst performance in more than five years.\n\nAnalysts say\u00a0Apple will likely either need to raise prices or eat additional tariff costs when the new duties come into effect. UBS analysts estimated on Monday that Apple\u2019s highest-end iPhone could rise in price by about $350, or around 30%, from its current price of $1,199.\n\nBarclays analyst Tim Long wrote that he expects Apple to raise prices, or the company could suffer as much as a 15% cut to earnings per share. Apple may also be able to rearrange its supply chain so that imports to the U.S. come from other countries with lower tariffs.\n\nApple declined to comment on the tariffs.\n\nSource: [Apple's 3-day loss in market cap swells to almost $640 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/07/apples-3-day-loss-in-market-cap-swells-to-almost-640-billion.html)",

Sales grew \\~5%, with EBIT up \\~10%, demonstrating strong operational performance.\n* **Backlog & Contracts:**\u00a0The company secured several contracts exceeding \u20ac500 million each, including deals for Rafale fighter systems, air defense radars, and a major 10-year French defense cloud project.\n* **Geopolitical Factors:**\u00a0With France increasing military spending and the EU pushing for greater defense self-sufficiency, Thales is well positioned in aerospace, cyber-security, and defense electronics.\n* **Valuation:**\u00a0Thales trades at a\u00a0**P/E of 28\u00d7 and an EV/EBITDA of 13\u201315\u00d7**, higher than historical norms, suggesting much of the expected growth is might be reflected in its stock price.\n\n# Leonardo (Italy)\n\n* **Performance:**\u00a0Leonardo posted\u00a0**double-digit growth in 2024**, with\u00a0**revenues up 11% to \u20ac17.8 billion**\u00a0and EBITA rising 13%.\n* **Backlog & Contracts:**\u00a0Its\u00a0**order backlog now exceeds \u20ac44 billion**, with strong bookings for helicopters, Eurofighter Typhoon exports, and defense electronics.\n* **Growth Drivers:**\u00a0As Italy increases defense spending toward NATO\u2019s 2% target, Leonardo is set to benefit from major defense programs. Additionally, its ownership of Leonardo DRS provides access to U.S. military contracts.\n* **Valuation:**\u00a0Still trading at\u00a0**20\u00d7 earnings and only \\~1\u00d7 sales**, despite it's recent impressive runup, Leonardo appears to still be undervalued compared to peers. If it continues improving margins and cash flow, there is\u00a0**significant room for multiple expansion**.\n\n# Rheinmetall (Germany)\n\n* **Performance:**\u00a0Rheinmetall transformed into a\u00a0**rapidly growing pure-play defense leader**, with\u00a0**sales up 30\u201340% and profits doubling**\u00a0in 2023.\n* **Backlog & Contracts:**\u00a0The company\u2019s\u00a0**order backlog soared to \u20ac52 billion by Q3 2024**, nearly five times its annual revenue. Major wins include a\u00a0**\u20ac8.5 billion artillery ammunition deal**, a\u00a0**\u20ac3.5 billion military truck order**, and expanding production in air defense and armored vehicles.\n* **Geopolitical Momentum:**\u00a0Germany\u2019s \u20ac100 billion defense modernization effort provides a long-term growth runway for Rheinmetall, particularly in armored vehicles, artillery, and munitions.\n* **Valuation:**\u00a0The stock trades at over\u00a0**80\u00d7 earnings,**\u00a0with an insane recent run. While its backlog supports long-term growth,\u00a0**valuation risk is high**. I'd probably wait for a pullback on this one but what do I know, I wouldn't have bought Tesla either.\n\n# Saab AB (Sweden)\n\n* **Performance:**\u00a0Saab delivered\u00a0**23% organic sales growth**\u00a0in 2024, with\u00a0**EBIT up 32% and revenue reaching SEK 63.7 billion (\\~$6.2 billion)**.\n* **Backlog & International Demand:**\u00a0Its\u00a0**order backlog grew 22% to SEK 187 billion (\\~$17 billion)**, supported by strong exports of anti-tank weapons, radars, and Gripen fighter upgrades.\n* **Growth Outlook:**\u00a0With Sweden increasing defense spending and expanding its NATO role, Saab is well-positioned. Demand for its Carl-Gustaf anti-armor weapons and air defense radars continues to surge.\n* **Valuation:**\u00a0Saab trades at\u00a0**35\u201340\u00d7 earnings**, above its historical average (\\~23\u00d7). While it has strong international demand, much of its near-term growth is already priced in.\n\n# Valuation Comparison of Major Players\n\n|Company|P/E (Trailing)|P/E (Forward)|EV/EBITDA|P/S Ratio|Upside Potential|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|**BAE Systems**|\\~21\u00d7|\\~15\u00d7|12\u201314\u00d7|\\~1.5\u00d7|**Moderate**|\n|**Thales**|\\~28\u00d7|\\~23\u00d7|13\u201315\u00d7|\\~2\u00d7|**Limited**\u00a0(Priced in)|\n|**Leonardo**|\\~20\u00d7|\\~12\u00d7|\\~9\u00d7|\\~1\u00d7|**High**\u00a0(Undervalued)|\n|**Rheinmetall**|\\~80\u00d7|\\~30\u00d7+|20\u00d7+|\\~3\u00d7|**High**\u00a0(But Expensive)|\n|**Saab**|\\~41\u00d7|\\~24\u00d7|\\~14\u00d7|\\~2\u00d7|**Moderate**\u00a0(Valuation Risk)|\n\n# Under-the-Radar EU Defense Companies\n\n# Hensoldt (Germany)\n\n* **Specializes in defense electronics (radars, optronics, electronic warfare).**\n* **Backlog of \u20ac6.64 billion**\u00a0(up 20% YoY).\n* **Revenue grew 21% in 2024**; targets \u20ac5 billion annually by 2030.\n* **Undervalued vs peers despite critical role in surveillance & air defense.**\n\n# QinetiQ Group (UK)\n\n* **Provides defense R&D, robotics, and test & evaluation services.**\n* **Backlog of \u00a32.9 billion**, growing internationally.\n* **P/E \\~16\u00d7 (trailing), \\~12\u00d7 (forward).**\n* **Niche in high-tech defense solutions, with strong cash flow.**\n\n# Chemring Group (UK)\n\n* **Specializes in munitions, countermeasures, and explosive detection.**\n* **Backlog of \u00a31.35 billion, revenue up 8% in 2024.**\n* **P/E in mid-teens, trading at a discount vs larger defense firms.**\n* **High demand for its battlefield tech and missile countermeasures.**\n\n# Kongsberg Gruppen (Norway)\n\n* **Leading missile and air defense supplier in Europe.**\n* **Backlog of NOK 88 billion (\\~$8.5 billion).**\n* **Major supplier of NASAMS air defense system and Naval Strike Missile.**\n* **Strong growth potential as NATO nations standardize on its weapons.**\n* **Increased Arctic military interest could mean it's a good speculative Arctic play**\n\n# Conclusion/Outlook\n\nWith\u00a0**record order backlogs and rising military budgets**, European defence is likely to see a rather\u00a0**significant boom**. Fears of a complete\u00a0**NATO collapse aside**, EU leaders including\u00a0**Macron and Germany's new chancellor**\u00a0are increasingly open and pushing for a\u00a0**European army**, as it's clear the age of reliance on US defence is coming to an end. I'm going to be creating a mini-etf with these stocks (allocations pending) and seeing how they perform over the next few years.\n\n**TLDR**:\n\n* **Leonardo and BAE Systems**\u00a0appear\u00a0**undervalued**\u00a0relative to their peers.\n* **Thales, Saab, and Rheinmetall**\u00a0have strong growth, but their stocks already reflect much of the upside.\n* **Smaller players like Hensoldt, QinetiQ, and Chemring**\u00a0could offer better risk-reward opportunities.\n\nGiven the rapid evolution of defense spending,\u00a0**selecting stocks with solid backlogs and reasonable valuations**\u00a0will be key to capturing underappreciated upside.",

        "title": "Apple Is Unlikely to Buy Sonos, But Amazon or Spotify Might Consider It",
        "selftext": ">The woes of speaker maker Sonos have raised the prospect of a takeover, but who might want to buy it? \n\n>\n\n>For months, Sonos Inc. has been reeling. After a disastrous software rollout last year, the audio technology company that some used to call \u201cthe Apple of speakers\u201d remains mired in the biggest crisis in its two-decade history.\n\n>\n\n>It all started in May when the company introduced a revamped app \u2014 the software that lets customers control their speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, headphones and other devices. The app was designed to modernize the Sonos experience and lay the groundwork for new types of products, such as the Ace headphones. But it lacked vital features and was hobbled by bugs, turning the simple act of using Sonos equipment into a nightmare.\n\n>\n\n>The missing features \u2014 including the sleep timer, advanced music queues, alarms, and functions related to searching and navigating music libraries \u2014 have mostly been restored. But users have reported that glitches persist in some cases: Devices don\u2019t pair, audio volume will spike without warning, connections fail, and streaming doesn\u2019t always go smoothly.\n\n>\n\n>Sonos should have never launched the new app the way it did and was aware of many bugs prior to the initial release. It should have kept around the old and reliable S2 app and launched the new version as a beta test. Once the revamped software became as dependable as the old app, Sonos could have moved forward with the new version as the default. Of course, that would have provided less of a splashy marketing opportunity \u2014 the chance to flip the switch on a whole new experience.\n\n>\n\n>So here we are. The new app ended up being devastating to employee morale, company revenue and the brand\u2019s reputation. It\u2019s a disaster on par with Apple\u2019s rocky move to its own Maps software from Google in 2012 \u2014 a switch that led to the ouster of the company\u2019s software chief. The big difference is that, for Apple, Maps is one app. For Sonos, the change compromised the software underpinning all its products.\n\n>\n\n>Sonos\u2019 board ultimately needed to take action. More than six months after the launch of the app \u2014 and even after an apology tour from its executives and a multitude of attempted fixes \u2014 the company parted ways with Chief Executive Officer Patrick Spence a week ago. The next day, it also cut loose its chief product officer, who many Sonos employees blamed for the app mess.\n\n>\n\n>In their place is interim CEO Tom Conrad, a co-creator of music streaming service Pandora and former executive at Snap Inc. He has served on the Sonos board since 2017 and was already helping with the app recovery effort. Though the company has vowed to search the globe for a new full-time CEO, many Sonos staffers believe Conrad has the inside track to get the job \u2014 if he wants it.\n\n>\n\n>But with Sonos\u2019 market valuation hovering around $1.7 billion \u2014 down from more than $5 billion during a pandemic-fueled rally \u2014 the board will probably consider whether selling the company makes more sense.\n\n>\n\n>Apple has long been seen as a potential suitor, given the two companies\u2019 similarities. Sonos is focused on premium design with a tightly controlled ecosystem \u2014 just like Apple. They share a penchant for audio technology, and their corporate cultures have some overlap.\n\n>\n\n>Apple could snap up Sonos for $2 billion or so \u2014 less than it paid for Beats \u2014 and it would only cost them a few days\u2019 worth of revenue. Sonos\u2019 hardware could also shore up Apple\u2019s disappointing HomePod and home audio lineup.\n\n>\n\n>But I don\u2019t believe Apple will ever acquire Sonos. If Apple really wanted to build out its home audio business, it already has the hardware, software, content and manufacturing chops internally. It\u2019s just about wanting to get things done properly \u2014 something that Apple is already working on. Later this year, it will launch its own home hub and a new HomePod mini.\n\n>\n\n>The only things it would gain from Sonos are a user base, a collection of patents and the employees \u2014 none of which Apple needs. Sonos\u2019 software is obviously something Apple wouldn\u2019t want, especially in its current state, and audio hardware has become heavily commoditized.\n\n>\n\n>Other potential suitors, such as Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp., wouldn\u2019t make much sense either. Meta has all but exited the smart home, choosing to focus on AI and wearables instead. Google has a painful history with Sonos involving patent lawsuits. And Microsoft has increasingly scaled back its interest in non-Xbox hardware in recent years.\n\n>\n\n>Still, there are some major technology companies that might consider the idea. That list includes [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Roku Inc. and Spotify Technology SA.\n\n>\n\n>Amazon seems like the most natural fit. With former Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay now leading its hardware efforts, the expectation is that Amazon will revamp its device lineup and shift toward more upscale offerings. Sonos\u2019 speakers already work with the entire streaming music industry and are certainly high-end.\n\n>\n\n>Sonos\u2019 premium technology could be the basis for a series of new Amazon Echo devices running the upcoming AI-infused Alexa digital assistant. It would also help Amazon expand into new areas, such as over-ear headphones and soundbars \u2014 two categories the company has explored in the past.\n\n>\n\n>Amazon could certainly afford to buy Sonos, though it would have to overcome regulatory hurdles. Don\u2019t forget: Amazon had to back out of a deal to buy Roomba maker iRobot Corp. after the European Union threatened to block the acquisition.\n\n>\n\n>A European company like Spotify might have an easier time getting a deal cleared. The streaming music service has championed the idea of hardware products that can run services from several different players, which Sonos does well. Spotify has long wanted to get into hardware but struggled to make it happen. Sonos would give them an instant entry, with an excellent range of products that could run its audio services.\n\n>\n\n>Roku is another possibility, though it would probably face antitrust concerns. After all, the company already sells a set of low-end soundbars and TV speakers. If it could make a deal work, Roku would get higher-end products that can potentially command higher profit margins. One caveat: This may need to be a stock-based deal given Roku doesn\u2019t have as much cash on hand as its bigger rivals.\n\n>\n\n>Samsung is a wild card. The company already sells soundbars and subwoofers and even acquired the Harman brand in 2017. But it\u2019s failed to crack the home speaker space. It announced an Echo-like speaker called the Galaxy Home several years ago but never actually brought it to market. Sonos would help it create a more consumer-focused line of home audio gear and provide more modern technology for its home theater products.\n\n>\n\n>For consumers, the best scenario is probably Sonos figuring things out and remaining independent \u2014 the current goal of the company. With the world\u2019s biggest tech giants expanding into every facet of our lives, there is something appealing about an independent brand that plays nice with all the platforms. It\u2019s just unclear how long Sonos will be able to do it alone.\n\n>\n\n>Retail inventory of the current iPhone SE quickly shrinks ahead of new model\u2019s debut. One of Apple\u2019s most significant new products this year will be the the iPhone SE\u2019s replacement. The device \u2014 codenamed V59 \u2014 will mark the beginning of Apple\u2019s transition from Qualcomm Inc. cellular modem chips to silicon designed in-house. It also means the company will no longer sell an iPhone with the now-antiquated home button. The latest model, which will also add Apple Intelligence, is set to launch by the spring \u2014 and there are signs Apple is gearing up for the release.\n\n>\n\n>According to people working in Apple\u2019s retail operations, a surprisingly large number of US stores have little to no inventory of the iPhone SE remaining. Consumers can still get the device from the online store \u2014 and it ships out within a few days \u2014 but finding one at a brick-and-mortar outlet is going to be harder and harder. Apple also has ceased sales of the current SE in the European Union because the device lacks the now-required USB-C port.\n\n>\n\n>The drawing down of inventory is a reliable sign that a new model is coming. But it also suggests that Apple probably won\u2019t keep the current version around \u2014 at a reduced price \u2014 after the update is here. That seems like a missed opportunity, since a cheap iPhone could\u2019ve helped Apple make inroads in some markets. The current SE costs $429, and the new one might be more than that given its enhanced features.\n\n>\n\n>This new iPhone isn\u2019t the only big product update on the horizon. As I wrote last week, look out for upcoming MacBook Airs with the M4 \u201cDonan\u201d chip, as well as fresh low-end iPads, iPad Airs and new Magic Keyboards in the not-too-distant future.\n\n>\n\n>Apple is bringing AI to Mac Mail app in macOS 15.4, even as it scales back notification summaries in iOS 18.3. The Apple Intelligence rollout is continuing with the release of macOS 15.3 in a few weeks. For the first time, Apple is bringing its Genmoji custom emoji to the Mac \u2014 following their debut on the iPhone and iPad. The company will add more features by April with iOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4. The big addition at that time will be the new Siri digital assistant, which will be able to better tap into personal information and use the App Intents technology to more precisely control apps.\n\n>\n\n>But there\u2019s another, more under-the-radar feature coming in April as well: The Mac will get the upgraded Mail app that uses AI to prioritize messages and sort content into different inboxes. Right now, iPad and iPhone users are able to tap into the feature \u2014 which is terrific \u2014 but Mac customers have been left behind. That changes with macOS 15.4, I\u2019m told. For those not familiar with the feature: It sorts mail into a primary category, as well as ones for transactions, promotions, updates and all mail.\n\n>\n\n>In other Apple Intelligence news, the company is scaling back notification summaries in iOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3. For months, news organizations and users have been complaining about incorrect or misleading notifications from Apple Intelligence. Rather than quickly fixing its AI models, Apple is simply pulling the plug on summaries from news and entertainment apps. You can also more easily disable summaries from the lock screen, and recaps are now italicized.\n\n>\n\n>Apple\u2019s ex-chief people officer lands at HP. It\u2019s not easy to join Apple after a career outside the company. The place is run by big personalities like Tim Cook, Phil Schiller, Greg Joswiak and others who have been there for several decades. In other words, if you\u2019re walking into Apple thinking you\u2019re going to change how it operates, you\u2019re in for a surprise.\n\n>\n\n>That was the case with Carol Surface, who joined Apple in 2023 as chief people officer after working at Medtronic Plc, Best Buy Co. and PepsiCo Inc. She flamed out after less than two years. Stella Low, Apple\u2019s short-lived vice president of communications, ran into similar issues in 2022.\n\n>\n\n>Both women were hired by Cook himself and stayed at Apple for way less time than anticipated, but now they have another thing in common: They landed at HP Inc. afterward. Low joined the computer maker as its chief communications officer in 2022 and recently left. Surface just agreed to join HP and is starting March 24. Given Surface\u2019s successful and varied human resources career prior to Apple, she could end up being a good fit for HP.\n\n>\n\n>Speaking of Apple\u2019s insidery culture: It was no surprise that Surface\u2019s role was ultimately filled by Deirdre O\u2019Brien, her predecessor and a 30-plus-year veteran of the company. Low, meanwhile, was replaced by Kristin Huguet, a member of Apple\u2019s PR department since before the original iPhone went on sale.\n\n>\n\n>They\u2019re both capable leaders, but Apple will eventually need to figure out how to bring in more talent from the outside. Right now, the company isn\u2019t always built to handle fresh ideas from newcomers. With Apple\u2019s need to innovate and find new sources of revenue, that might be a problem in the not-too-distant future.\n\n>\n\n**The Schedule**\n\n>Jan. 22 \u2014 Samsung unveils Galaxy S25 line. Samsung is set to announce its Galaxy S25 smartphone lineup at its Unpacked event this week in San Jose, California. This year\u2019s devices aren\u2019t expected to get a major hardware overhaul, with the company instead focusing more on software and artificial intelligence features. But Samsung aims to show that it has an edge over Apple in this area. Stay tuned for coverage of Unpacked this week, including all of the details of the new devices. And if you\u2019re waiting for news on Samsung smartwatches and foldable phones, those will likely debut later in the year.\n\n>\n\n>Jan. 30 \u2014 Apple\u2019s first-quarter results. The earnings report \u2014 the first under Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh \u2014 will give details of Apple\u2019s all-important holiday season. Investors will get an idea of how the iPhone 16 is selling, as well as updated AirPods and Apple Watches. The company also should provide the first real sense of whether the Apple Intelligence AI platform is spurring consumers to upgrade their devices. Wall Street is looking for about $124 billion in revenue during the period, a 4% gain from a year earlier.\n\n>\n\n>**Post Game Q&A**\n\n>Q: Why is Tim Cook attending the Trump inauguration?\n\n>A: Many Apple employees are none too pleased that their CEO is heading to Washington to kiss the ring and attend Trump\u2019s swearing-in event on Monday. (Cook also personally donated $1 million to the inauguration fund.) The move seems to clash with Apple\u2019s support of diversity, immigration and other progressive causes \u2014 ones that Cook himself has championed. But it\u2019s equally clear that Apple may need Trump\u2019s help over the next four years as it contends with tariffs, the Justice Department antitrust case and mounting pressure from the European Union. Cook likely believes Trump can alleviate these problems. He\u2019s also not alone in turning out for the president-elect. Most of the world\u2019s most valuable tech companies are sending a high-profile leader to the event.\n\n>\n\n>Q: When are the new Powerbeats Pro 2 launching?\n\n>A: The latest earbuds from Apple\u2019s Beats subsidiary are due imminently. The new accessory has already been submitted to the Federal Communications Commission and other regulators for approval, and the company is gearing up for a press briefing in a week or so to go over the details of the new product. The upgrades will feature a smaller overall design and improvements like Spatial Audio and enhanced noise cancellation that are already available on AirPods. The programming code within iOS also suggests that these earbuds could be capable of collecting heart-rate data from a wearer. I\u2019ve previously reported that Apple is working on this technology and actively testing it.\n\n>\n\n>Q: Why is Apple starting to use US-made chips?\n\n>A: A major, under-discussed risk facing Apple right now is that practically 100% of its advanced processors are made in Taiwan by partner TSMC. If Taiwan goes down for whatever reason (a political crisis, natural disaster or something else), Apple is in big trouble with no real plan B. That\u2019s why moving more production to other areas is so critical, and such a shift is now underway. TSMC is running test production of lower-end Apple chips at a facility in Arizona, the first step toward more ambitious goals. Over time, Apple hopes to get chips from other factories in the US and elsewhere, including Europe. Let\u2019s face it, the company has been fairly lucky so far that its chip production hasn\u2019t suffered major hiccups. Apple\u2019s reliance on one geographic location for the most important component in its devices has been a major hazard for years.\n\n>\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-19/sonos-woes-spark-apple-deal-talk-mail-with-ai-coming-in-macos-15-4-iphone-se](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-19/sonos-woes-spark-apple-deal-talk-mail-with-ai-coming-in-macos-15-4-iphone-se)",

        "title": "Big Tech\u2019s Earnings Problem Is Estimates May Be Way Too High",
        "selftext": ">The last time Big Tech delivered earnings,\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0had just started his term, stocks were soaring on expectations of a pro-growth government agenda and investors\u2019 main worry was how long it would take companies to convert their artificial intelligence spending into profits.\n\n>Three months later, they are facing a far bleaker picture.\n\n>This week\u2019s quarterly results from\u00a0Microsoft Corp.,\u00a0Apple Inc.,\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc.\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon.com Inc\u00a0will land in a market obsessed with every twist of a trade war that\u2019s wiped $5.5 trillion from the\u00a0S&P 500 Index. AI concerns have taken a back seat to angst over the possibility of a tariff-induced recession, while safe havens like gold have become the trade de jour for investors too rattled to buy stocks on the cheap.\n\n>Even with all the uncertainty, Wall Street isn\u2019t giving the companies\u2019 estimates much wiggle room. Analysts expect the so-called Magnificent Seven \u2014 which also includes Google-parent\u00a0Alphabet,\u00a0Tesla Inc.\u00a0and\u00a0Nvidia Corp.\u00a0\u2014 to deliver an average of 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that\u2019s barely budged since the start of March despite the flareup in trade tensions.\n\n>That raises the stakes for the four megacaps reporting this week, which collectively have a nearly 20% weighting in the S&P 500. Traders are unlikely to forgive earnings shortfalls in an already fearful market climate, despite steep declines in the stocks\u2019 share prices and improved valuations. Dire outlooks from the industry behemoths would also be poorly received, especially if they bolster\u00a0fears\u00a0of muted corporate spending ahead.\n\n>\u201cAny modicum of a weaker than expected number is going to cause a further selloff because of the concern around tariffs,\u201d said\u00a0Phil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic Wealth, who believes this year\u2019s weakness in megacaps is a buying opportunity.\n\n>Markets got an early read on how Big Tech might be faring last week. Tesla reported its\u00a0worst quarter\u00a0in years, though traders cheered signs that chief executive\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0intends to step away from his government work and focus more on the electric-vehicle maker. Alphabet\u00a0beat expectations\u00a0but offered little future guidance. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7\u00a0index\u00a0jumped 9.1% last week amid a broader market rebound, though it\u2019s still down 15% in 2025.\n\n>A deeper look comes during a two-day stretch that starts with results from Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday. While many executives have declined to predict how tariffs might impact their bottom lines, Wall Street has been doing its own math. Based on a 22% tariff rate modeled by Bloomberg Economics, lower gross margins could result in a net income contraction of about 7% in 2025 for the S&P 500, compared with the current consensus estimate of nearly 12% growth,\u00a0wrote\u00a0Bloomberg Intelligence chief equity strategist\u00a0Gina Martin Adams.\n\n>Another key area of focus will be spending: The four biggest spenders \u2014 Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta \u2014 are projected to pour roughly $300 billion into capital expenditures in their current fiscal years. While the companies have pledged to maintain that pace in 2025, Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0sudden decision\u00a0to pause work on some data centers suggests cloud computing providers may be re-evaluating expenditures.\n\n>Apple, one of the companies most exposed to tariffs due to its supply chain reliance on China, may benefit from a pull-forward in demand from consumers seeking to avoid higher prices. However, those sales are seen as a one-off benefit, with tariffs sapping demand in future quarters. Amazon faces tariff risks to its e-commerce and advertising businesses, though a hit to profits could be cushioned by earnings in its high-margin web services unit, according to Jefferies analyst\u00a0Brent Thill.\n\n>That said, there\u2019s little expectation that executives will be able to give estimates with any degree of confidence, given the high level of macroeconomic uncertainty.\u00a0American Airlines Group Inc.\u00a0and\u00a0Skechers USA Inc.\u00a0are among companies that have\u00a0abandoned\u00a0forecasts this quarter.\n\n>Michael Shaoul, founder of the ION Macro Fund, said it will be difficult for executives to convince the market that they have a true view into financial performance in coming quarters.\n\n>\u201cI think the more experienced management aren\u2019t even going to try,\u201d he said.\n\n>A bullish argument, of course, is that tech giants\u2019 dominant industry positions and robust balance sheets make them better suited to withstand an economic downturn than other companies \u2014 even if the earnings picture is cloudy. The Magnificent Seven are also less richly valued following the recent selloff: Alphabet, for example, trades at 17 times profits estimated over the next 12 months, compared with an average over the past decade of 21 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n>That could boost the appeal of the Magnificent Seven to dip-buyers, especially if signs of easing in the global trade war emerge. A flash of that came last week, when stocks soared after Trump\u00a0said\u00a0a deal with Beijing would significantly reduce the tariffs he\u2019s posted on Chinese goods.\n\n>But for\u00a0Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, it all comes down to the denominator in the price-to-earnings ratio.\n\n>\u201cThe valuations are getting more interesting down here, but we haven\u2019t pulled the trigger yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of questions on the E-side of the equation.\u201d\n\n\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-27/big-tech-s-earnings-problem-is-estimates-may-be-way-too-high](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-27/big-tech-s-earnings-problem-is-estimates-may-be-way-too-high)",

        "selftext": "Denim is having a moment with consumers, but it hasn\u2019t led to a major sales boost at Levi Strauss. \n\nThe jeans creator on Wednesday posted fiscal second-quarter revenue that fell just short of Wall Street\u2019s expectations at a time when shoppers are stocking their wardrobes with denim dresses, skirts and ultra low-rise baggy pants. \n\nLevi\u2019s posted better-than-expected earnings as its direct sales to consumers and cost cutting continue to bear fruit. The company raised its dividend by 8% to 13 cents per share, its first increase in six quarters.\n\nStill, shares fell about 12% in extended trading.\n\nHere\u2019s how Levi\u2019s performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected\nRevenue: $1.44 billion vs. $1.45 billion expected\nThe company\u2019s reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 26 was $18 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.6 million, or zero cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Levi\u2019s posted earnings of $66 million, or 16 cents per share. \n\nSales rose to $1.44 billion, up about 8% from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, the sales jump was coming off of an easier comparison.\n\nIn the year-ago period, sales were down 9% after Levi\u2019s shifted its wholesale shipments from its fiscal second quarter into its fiscal first quarter. The shift reduced sales last year by about $100 million, the company said previously. Excluding the shift, as well as the exit of Levi\u2019s Denizen business, sales would have been up by only about 1% in its most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period. \n\nFinance chief Harmit Singh attributed the sales miss to unfavorable foreign exchange conditions and weak sales at Docker\u2019s. During the quarter, the khaki and chinos brand saw $82.4 million in sales, up 8.6% from $75.8 million in the year ago period. It\u2019s not clear how sales at Docker\u2019s were affected by the timing of Levi\u2019s wholesale orders. \n\n\u201cPeople are generally cautious,\u201d Singh told CNBC in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily an environment where people are buying a lot, people are cautious.\u201d\n\nWhile Levi\u2019s posted a strong earnings beat, it only reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which was in line with estimates. The company continues to expect full-year earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27, which now includes a 5-cent hit coming from the company\u2019s new distribution and logistics strategy. \n\nLevi\u2019s said it is transitioning from a primarily owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the U.S. and Europe to one that relies more on third parties. \n\n\u201cIn the near term, these changes require the parallel operation of new and old facilities for the rest of 2024, resulting in a transitory increase in distribution costs,\u201d the company said. \n\nThe change allows Levi\u2019s to shift the responsibility of final mile delivery to third parties. The denim maker noted that it has new terms with its supplier that result in Levi\u2019s taking ownership of inventory closer to the point of shipment rather than its eventual destination. Levi\u2019s distribution network was built for a business that primarily sold to wholesalers, and now it needs to change into one that\u2019s more focused on selling directly to consumers.\n\nThe changes are necessary because nearly half of Levi\u2019s sales these days are coming from its own website and stores.\n\nDirect-to-consumer sales jumped 8% during the quarter, representing 47% of overall sales. Online sales increased 19%.\n\n\u201cOur transformational pivot to operating as a DTC-first company is yielding positive results around the world, giving me great confidence that we will achieve accelerated, profitable growth for the rest of the year and beyond,\u201d CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement. \n\nDuring the quarter, wholesale revenue grew 7%, but excluding the shift in timing of wholesale orders, sales in the channel decreased 4%. Singh noted that wholesale revenue improved on a sequential basis, but the company has a \u201cconservative\u201d view of the channel\u2019s growth moving forward.\n\nBy building out its own direct channels, Levi\u2019s enjoys higher profits, better data on its consumers and less reliance on shaky wholesalers like Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s, which are continuing to shrink and fall out of favor with consumers. \n\nHowever, selling directly can also be more expensive, and can come with unexpected hiccups that can impact sales and drain profits. For example, when someone buys a pair of Levi\u2019s from Macy\u2019s and wants to return them, Macy\u2019s typically bears that cost. Under a direct model, that responsibility, including the cost and logistics, would fall on Levi\u2019s. \n\nNike has come to be known as a cautionary tale for retailers long reliant on wholesalers that try to expand direct sales. \n\nFor a while, Nike\u2019s focus on direct sales boosted revenue and profits, but some critics said the strategy shift led to a slowdown in innovation, and ultimately, market share losses. \n\nRecently, the company acknowledged that it erred when it cut off so many of its wholesale partners and said it has since \u201ccorrected\u201d that. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/levi-levi-earnings-q2-2024.html",

They lowered forecasts, but I didn\u2019t see this as warranting the drop it ended up seeing.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t going to just stop needing their medication, also from what I understand right now they have one of the most competitive oral pills for weight loss in the pipeline right now and working to offer their medication in China which has one of the largest obese populations in the world. \n\nLastly it\u2019s PE/Forward PE aren\u2019t too high versus the average of the industry. LLY on the other hand has a PE over 100 right now and a forward PE in the 30 range. I don\u2019t particularly buy this, both LLY and NVO have research in the pipeline, but don\u2019t see how LLY can lower their PE by that much in the next year or so. \n\nI only bring up LLY in all of this because it seems like it\u2019s been hit less than NVO. Both drugs are pretty overpriced (can stem from a  lack of regulation of PBMs) so for all this senate hearing noise, I don\u2019t see why it effects one more than the other besides the fact that LLY is a US company and NVO is not.\n\nWhat\u2019s everyone else\u2019s take on this? Is there something I\u2019m missing here?\n\nEdit: in regard to capital structure, LLY also has a greater reliance on debt than NVO. Dont necessarily think this is a bad thing, but worth noting NVO isn\u2019t growing/expanding through added debt. ",

VKTX's drug (https://vikingtherapeutics.com/pipeline/metabolic-disease-program/vk2735/) is highly regarded, with lower side effects than most.\n\n\"Compared to LLY it seems like this company is more focused and leaner, which to me seems like a plus.\"\n\nIt can be but that's often an \"it is until it isn't\" imo; it's great when the theme in question is big but the moment others start to become competitive (I'd be surprised if a large pharma co w/o obesity exposure doesn't eventually buy VKTX) and/or trials start disappointing, the name is going lower. I'd rather the more diversified company. \n\nI think the NVO selloff is overdone at this point, but not without some reason behind it imo.\n\nInteresting discussion of tirzepatide vs semaglutide https://www.reddit.com/r/tirzepatidecompound/comments/1bzskn9/how_much_better_is_tirzepatide_semaglutide/",

        "title": "Original Research - Avoid Baidu ($BIDU): \"Don't Get Tricked By China's AOL\"; OR Why Its \u201cGlobal AI\u201d Hype Falls Flat",
        "selftext": "Baidu loves to sell itself as China\u2019s leading AI innovator. Western investors often lump it in with Chinese \u201ctech champions.\u201d But a closer look reveals the truth: Baidu\u2019s overseas presence is negligible\u2014less than 1% of revenue\u2014despite years of flashy announcements about AI labs, cloud services, and self-driving projects outside China. Its so-called global ambitions have barely moved the needle.\n\nBaidu\u2019s inability to generate meaningful overseas revenue, despite years of aggressive AI branding and expansion efforts, is not just a matter of tough market conditions\u2014it is a clear indicator of deep structural problems within the company. This failure reflects fundamental issues with strategy execution, capital allocation, leadership decision-making, and competitive positioning.\n\nIn my view, Baidu is kind of like the worst house on a dangerous street: it's an aging property with structural issues, stuck in a declining neighborhood where better-built businesses have already moved on to safer, more lucrative markets. Investors hoping for a turnaround are betting on renovations that won't materialize, while smarter money flows into sturdier, globally competitive multi-nationals like Lenovo, Haier, Xiaomi, and BYD.\n\nBaidu isn\u2019t just in a tough spot\u2014it\u2019s in a market that\u2019s moving past it.\n\n# The Unfulfilled Dream of \u201cChina\u2019s Google\u201d\n\nBaidu was once hailed as \u201cChina\u2019s Google,\u201d dominating a market where Google was blocked. That moniker created an expectation that it would naturally go global\u2014just like Google did. However, every major overseas push from Baidu has fizzled:\n\n* Japan Search Engine (launched in 2007) never surpassed low-single-digit market share and shut down in 2015.\n* Southeast Asia Utility Apps saw initial downloads (DU Battery Saver, etc.) but failed to retain users; many apps were plagued by adware allegations.\n* India Ban abruptly cut off a huge market in 2020 when geopolitical tensions led to restrictions on Chinese apps.\n* Cloud and Robotaxis remain mostly China-centric, without the global scale of Alibaba Cloud or Huawei\u2019s data centers.\n\nInstead of becoming a global behemoth, Baidu is stuck with near-100% reliance on China\u2019s ad market and domestic AI cloud business. Its \u201cglobal AI champion\u201d pitch sounds exciting, but there\u2019s little actual revenue to back it up.\n\n# Management\u2019s Stop-and-Start Strategy\n\nOne reason for Baidu\u2019s stagnation abroad is its on-again, off-again international focus:\n\n* Internal shakeups and management turmoil kept the business pivoting from search to apps, from apps to AI, from AI to EV software, etc.\n* These abrupt strategy shifts wasted capital and left foreign users unconvinced and Western rivals unchallenged.\n* ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent moved faster and more decisively, seizing digital opportunities at home and abroad.\n\nAll this has left Baidu vulnerable to shifts in China\u2019s macro and regulatory landscape\u2014unlike peers that truly diversified overseas.\n\n# Meanwhile, Other Chinese Companies Are Thriving Abroad\n\nWhile Baidu\u2019s overseas revenue remains a rounding error, several Chinese companies have systematically expanded beyond their home market\u2014often capturing significant shares of revenue abroad:\n\n**Lenovo**\n\n* Generates \\~75% of its revenue overseas in PCs, servers, and services.\n* Successfully acquired IBM\u2019s PC and server businesses, scaling up a global supply chain and brand presence.\n\n**Haier**\n\n* Over 50% of sales come from outside China.\n* Bought iconic appliance brands like GE Appliances in the U.S., building localized manufacturing and distribution worldwide.\n\n**Xiaomi**\n\n* Aggressively moved into India, Southeast Asia, Europe, and more, combining cost-competitive smartphones with robust local partnerships.\n\n**BYD & CATL**\n\n* Leading the EV and battery space not just in China, but globally\u2014securing deals with top automakers and scaling in Europe, the U.S., and beyond.\n\n**WuXi Biologics, Transsion, Etc.**\n\nMany other Chinese firms, from biotech to mobile phone brands, have established real foreign footprints that diversify their revenue streams.\n\nThese Chinese global players compete head-to-head with Western incumbents in advanced economies and capture demand in emerging markets\u2014all while being priced far below many U.S. or European multinationals.\n\n# Why Investors Should Care About Ex-China Successes \n\n1. Diversification Away from China\u2019s Economy\n\nCompanies with 50\u201375% of sales overseas are far less vulnerable to a domestic slowdown or stricter policies at home.\n\n2. Genuine Global Growth\n\nThese firms have already proven they can localize, partner, or acquire to enter new markets\u2014unlike Baidu, which talks big but executes poorly.\n\n3. Undervalued vs. Global Peers\n\nSentiment around \u201cChinese risk\u201d keeps valuations low. However, the actual risk for globally diversified firms is materially different\u2014and in many ways lower\u2014than for a purely domestic player like Baidu.\n\n4. Fast-Compounding International Revenues\n\nIf emerging markets in India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East continue to boom\u2014or if Western consumers embrace Chinese EVs and hardware\u2014companies like Lenovo, Haier, Xiaomi, and BYD are already positioned to grab that growth.\n\n# The Bottom Line: Steer Clear of Baidu, Focus on the Real Global Champs\n\n* Baidu Is a Not-So-Awesome \u201cChina-Only\u201d Story\n\nIts domestic ad revenues are plateauing, short-video competitors are eating market share, and foreign expansions are just pilot projects that haven\u2019t delivered meaningful sales.\n\n* Baidu Overseas Hype Is Empty\n\nA decade of repeated attempts\u2014from search in Japan to robotaxis in the UAE\u2014has not yielded substantial user adoption or revenue. There\u2019s little reason to believe another pivot will magically pay off.\n\n* Others Have Cracked the Code\n\nLenovo, Haier, Xiaomi, BYD, and others each show that Chinese firms can indeed thrive globally\u2014but Baidu hasn\u2019t replicated that success.\n\n* There's Better Risk/Reward Elsewhere\n\nBaidu trades at a discount that I initially found tempting for my own portfolio. Who doesn't want a future AI windfall? But that bet relies on overseas revenue magically materializing after a decade of tries. If you want an angle on Chinese equities, go for the companies that have already demonstrated they can succeed abroad\u2014and leave Baidu, the \u201cworst house on a dangerous street,\u201d off your list.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI\u2019ve put together the above analysis of Baidu. I work on these memos for my own personal investments. I do not hold Baidu. \n\n**TLDR:** My analysis indicates Baidu is a much weaker company than other Chinese tech stocks and conversely that other Chinese tech stocks are much more investable than I had previously expected.",

I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and experiences with these kinds of investments.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m at:\n\n\u2022 **NU and SOFI**: Both have innovative approaches in the financial sector, but as banks, they could face significant challenges during broader economic slowdowns (e.g., credit defaults, regulatory pressures). On the flip side, their digital and tech-driven models might give them a competitive edge over traditional banks.\n\n\u2022 **HOOD**: This feels slightly less risky to me since it\u2019s primarily a broker and not a bank, so it might avoid some of the regulatory and credit-related risks. However, it\u2019s not without its challenges (reputation issues, reliance on transaction volume, etc.).\n\n\n\nOther factors I\u2019m weighing:\n\n\u2022 Pros: Growth potential in the fintech space, particularly with younger, tech-savvy customers.\n\n\u2022 Cons: Increased competition, potential regulatory scrutiny, and exposure to macroeconomic headwinds.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m curious\u2014what\u2019s your take on bank/fintech stocks in today\u2019s market? Are they worth the risk, or would you avoid them in favor of something less exposed to economic instability? Any insights on these specific companies would be especially helpful.

        "selftext": "Hi, everyone. I'm not formally trained in computer science or finance. I'm just someone who is passionate about the transformative potential of AI, financial markets and investing, among other topics.   \n  \nI've been working on an \"investment thesis\" of sorts (shown below) that involves a potential risk that seems to be somewhat overlooked in discussions about AI stocks. I am sharing it here in the hope that it might spark some interesting and fruitful conversation, particularly among those more experienced in the field of AI.  \n\n\n**The Overlooked Risk in AI Stocks:** While investors focus on the AI hardware race and GPU shortages, a more fundamental challenge looms: the growing scarcity of high-quality, diverse data for training advanced AI systems, particularly AGI. This overlooked bottleneck could significantly impact AI company valuations and the timeline for AGI development (if it can be achieved at all).  \n  \n**Current Market Narrative**  \n\u25feInvestors fixate on computing power, driving up valuations of hardware-focused companies.  \n\u25feThe prevailing logic: more GPUs equal more AI capability and value, which overlooks a critical flaw in the race towards AGI.  \n  \n**The Real Bottleneck**  \nAI performance, especially for AGI aspirations, hinges on three data factors:  \n\u25fe Quality: Accuracy and reliability  \n\u25feQuantity: Volume of useful examples  \n\u25feDiversity: Range of scenarios represented  \n  \nWhile data quantity grows exponentially, we face a 'data wall' - the supply of high-quality, novel, human-generated data becoming insufficient for advanced AI training and development. This poses critical risks:  \n\u25feClosed-loop AI content generation leading to digital entropy and degraded data quality/diversity  \n\u25feAmplification of biases and errors in AI outputs  \n\u25feFundamental limitations on achieving true general intelligence  \n  \nEmerging AI techniques like few-shot learning offer potential ways to scale this data wall but may not fully address the complex data needs for AGI development. Notably, while synthetic data can augment datasets, it cannot replace the richness and variability of real-world data essential for true understanding.  \n  \n**Key Takeaways:**  \n\u25fe Data scarcity is a critical risk in AI investment.  \n\u25fe The \"data wall\" limits advancements in AI/AGI.  \n\u25fe Quality, Quantity, and Diversity of data are essential for AI performance.  \n\u25fe Emerging techniques may help but have limitations.  \n\u25fe Synthetic data cannot fully substitute for real-world data.\n\n**Overvaluation Risks**  \n\u25fe Companies valued primarily on computational capacity  \n\u25fe Firms lacking robust data acquisition strategies  \n\u25fe Businesses dependent on public/synthetic data  \n  \n**Hidden Opportunities**  \n\u25fe Companies with unique data access  \n\u25fe Firms innovating in data collection and curation  \n\u25fe Enterprises focused on diverse, high-quality datasets crucial for AGI  \n  \n**Regulatory Considerations**  \n\u25fe Evolving privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) create new challenges  \n\u25fe Data access restrictions limit large-scale dataset use  \n\u25fe Cross-border data flow regulations risk creating regional \"data silos\"  \n\u25fe Demands for algorithmic transparency necessitate diverse, well-documented training data  \n  \n**Investment Framework**  \n**Key Questions:**  \n\u25fe What\u2019s their data sourcing strategy for advanced AI and potential AGI?  \n\u25fe Do they have unique high-quality data access?  \n\u25fe How sustainable is their data advantage in the AGI race?   \n\u25fe What if data becomes the primary constraint for AGI achievement?  \n  \n**Risk Indicators:**  \n\u25fe Over-reliance on public datasets  \n\u25fe Lack of proprietary data sources  \n\u25fe Limited data diversity for general intelligence tasks  \n\u25fe No clear data quality maintenance strategy  \n  \n**Portfolio Implications**  \n**Large Cap AI Stocks:**  \n\u25fe Reassess hardware-centric valuations  \n\u25fe Seek evidence of sustainable data advantages for AI development  \n\u25fe Consider data quality risk exposure in long-term AI/AGI strategies  \n  \n**Emerging Players:**  \n\u25fe Identify genuine data moat builders with AGI potential  \n\u25fe Seek innovative data acquisition approaches for general intelligence  \n\u25fe Prioritize quality and diversity over mere quantity  \n  \n**The Long View**  \n\u25fe The demand for high-quality data transcends economics, entering geopolitical realms  \n\u25fe \"Data wars\" may emerge as nations battle for data supremacy  \n\u25fe AGI achievement may prove more complex than current valuations suggest  \n  \n**Questions for Investors**  \n\u25fe How are you factoring data constraints into AI valuations, especially for companies pursuing AGI?  \n\u25fe What metrics evaluate a company's data advantages in the context of general intelligence development?  \n\u25fe How might data bottlenecks reshape the AI landscape and AGI timelines?\n\nI hope this perspective provides new insights into AI investment risks and opportunities, especially regarding the pursuit of AGI. I'm eager to hear others' thoughts on these potential market dynamics and data challenges in the journey towards general artificial intelligence. ",

I think the software companies have a lot more hurdles long term than the hardware/infrastructure companies that are already showing concrete growth. This data challenge is also why I'm so bullish on Google long term- they have the best data collection and analysis processes in the world which is why they have been working on machine learning and AI for such a long time already. The issue they have is a secondary issue all of these companies will need to figure out after the more difficult data issue- which is monetization and marketshare capture strategy for AI. Microsoft is better positioned on that front but their proprietary training data isn't as good as Google's. This is all without going down the rabbit hole of the copyright and trademark legal risk that the software vendors could open themselves up to if they're used in enterprise.",

        "title": "Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones",
        "selftext": "Qualcomm\u00a0said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.\n\nOf that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.\n\nThe latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm\u2019s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.\n\nQualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.\n\n*\u2033*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,\u201d Amon said at the investor event.\n\nAnother $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.\n\nQualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.\n\nQualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running\u00a0Google\u00a0Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to\u00a0Apple\u00a0for its iPhones.\n\nBut the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.\n\n\u201cWe put a strategy in \u201921, and we\u2019re not changing our strategy,\u201d Amon said.\n\nLaptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by\u00a0Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.\n\n\u201cThe competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,\u201d Amon said, referring to Apple\u2019s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. \u201cWe saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.\u201d\n\nThe forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including\u00a0Meta\u00a0for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.\n\nWhen it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an \u201cedge AI\u201d company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that\u2019s typically powered by\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0processors. Company officials didn\u2019t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.\n\nQualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that\u2019s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.\n\n\u201cWhat you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,\u201d Durga Malladi, Qualcomm\u2019s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/19/qualcomm-says-it-expects-4-billion-in-pc-sales-by-2029.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/19/qualcomm-says-it-expects-4-billion-in-pc-sales-by-2029.html)",

Trump's rhetoric over Greenland is making me think that this race is going to heat up potentially rather quickly.\n\nThere are many reasons the Arctic states (the US, Canada, Russia, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden) and observer states (including the UK, India, and China) are all interested including but not limited to many rare earth minerals, fossil fuels, and new shipping lanes.\n\nHere are some sectors that I think are worth keeping an eye on:\n\n1. Shipping and Logistics: Companies involved in Arctic-capable shipping or icebreaker services, like COSCO Shipping or Maersk\n\n2. Mining and Green Metals: Miners focused on rare earths, cobalt, lithium, and other critical minerals (e.g., MP Materials, Freeport-McMoRan)\n\n3. Energy: Despite declining global reliance on oil, Arctic energy reserves (natural gas and liquefied natural gas) could still offer opportunities for firms like Equinor or Gazprom.\n\n4. Infrastructure and Technology: Companies providing Arctic-specific technologies (e.g., ice-resistant equipment, autonomous mining tech) or building infrastructure in the region \n\n5. Defense Contractors: With growing geopolitical tensions, Arctic defense spending may increase. Think about companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, BAE, or Rolls Royce \n\nAnyone have any thoughts about this or any potential big winners?

        "selftext": "# As Intel exits the trough of the semiconductor cycle, does AMD still have hope? Twice as many assets as AMD is the biggest advantage.\n\n**Undervalued giant vs. overhyped challenger**\n\n\n\nIn 2024, when INTEL released its third-quarter earnings report, its stock price collapsed. Countless AMD fans cheered, various remarks continued in X SPACE, and mainstream media began to relay such as\n\n>\\* INTEL is going to die, stupid guys actually have their own factories and workers.\n\n>\\* They should learn from AMD, don't need to have anything, light assets are right. AMD YES!\n\n>\\* In the German market, 99% of shipments are AMD and only 1% are INTEL. INTEL is dead.\n\n>\\* The coachman and driver in the steam engine era, no company should be eliminated more than INTEL, and INTEL actually has a factory, which is a shame for the United States.\n\n>\\* Look at what Apple does, they only do design, wake up, the United States does not need factories.\n\n>\\* AMD has been on a roll in recent years. Once seen as the underdog, it is now worth nearly twice as much as Intel\u2014and Intel has twice as many assets, its own fabs, a global supply chain, and arguably the most strategic position in U.S. semiconductor security.\n\nI have asked these people a question more than once: how to understand the semiconductor cycle? Do chip manufacturers really not need the entire industry chain? Taking a step back, INTEL is the real domestic chip security in the United States. And what it gets is always endless ridicule.\n\nBut is this shift entirely justified? Or is it a reflection of market sentiment, AI hype, and short-term memory?\n\nI have worked as an IT technical consultant in the manufacturing industry, and I still have a good understanding of production. I know very well that owning a factory will be a heavy burden, which will lead to a longer cycle and profit encroachment, but the advantage is that once you pass the trough, your own production capacity will be a nuclear-powered money printing machine.\n\nAnd based on China's experience, the security brought by own factories is far greater than outsourcing.\n\nI deeply remember what the former CEO of INTEL said, \"We added AI chips and AI computing to the motherboard, but we don't know what it can do. This is what the application layer does.\" INTEL's dilemma is actually the same as Apple's. They are honest people in the industry. They tell the truth, and capital does not need the truth.There are countless AI enthusiasts, non-IT personnel, and AI vested interests. They will infinitely exaggerate AI, even if it is like science fiction. But no one cares, because this is what capital needs.\n\n **The myth that \u201cbigger is not better\u201d**\n\nIntel is one of the few companies in the world with full-stack semiconductor capabilities\u2014from x86 architecture design to advanced process nodes, packaging, foundry services, and global distribution. Although costly, its fixed assets provide the United States and its allies with protection against geopolitical risks and long-term strategic autonomy.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, AMD adopts a fabless model\u2014lean, capital-efficient, and agile. But it also means AMD is heavily dependent on TSMC, a potential single point of failure. In times of peace and profitability, this may seem like an advantage. But in times of turmoil, this may not be the case.\n\n\n\nWhile the market currently rewards asset-light models with higher P/E ratios, one can't help but ask: What is the intrinsic value of resilience, control, and national independence in the post-globalization era?\n\n\n\n **Intel's decline is real - but so is its reconstruction**\n\nLet's be honest: Intel has made mistakes. Delays in 10nm, missed opportunities in mobile, and a slow transition to AI have damaged its credibility. Investors have lost patience.\n\n\n\nBut Intel today is not the Intel of 2018. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company:\n\n\n\nIntroduced Intel 3G and 18A nodes ahead of schedule\n\n\n\nOpened its fabs (Intel foundries) to external customers\n\n\n\nGetted strong support through the CHIPS Act\n\n\n\nEntered AI accelerator market with Gaudi series chips\n\n\n\nWorked on IDM 2.0 strategy to regain manufacturing leadership\n\n\n\nThese are not promises on paper - they are capital-intensive, multi-year initiatives. If executed well, these initiatives may turn Intel from a \"value trap\" to a \"growth surprise\".\n\n\n\n **AMD: A great company, but is the hype sustainable?**\n\n\n\nTo be clear, AMD is a phenomenal success story. Lisa Su's leadership is a textbook case. Ryzen and EPYC have disrupted Intel's dominance in the consumer and data center markets. MI300X has now positioned AMD as the second-largest player in AI acceleration - second only to NVIDIA.\n\n\n\nHowever, AMD's stock price currently reflects its perfect execution in the extremely competitive AI market. Investors are betting that AMD will:\n\n\n\nSustain double-digit growth in the post-AI bubble era\n\n\n\nContinue to take market share from Intel and NVIDIA\n\n\n\nDeal with growing competition from internal accelerators (AWS, Google, Meta)\n\n\n\nThis won\u2019t be easy.\n\n\n\n**AI: A bursting bubble?**\n\n\n\nA large part of AMD\u2019s current valuation stems from the AI \u200b\u200bhype cycle. But problems are emerging:\n\n\n\nAI capex at hyperscalers is slowing\n\n\n\nTech giants are developing their own chips, reducing their reliance on AMD/NVIDIA\n\n\n\nMany AI startups that received funding in 2021-2023 are now working to monetize their models\n\n\n\nIf AI enters the \u201cnormalization phase,\u201d the outsized expectations associated with AMD may come under pressure. Meanwhile, Intel\u2014whose stock price already reflects pessimism\u2014has less to lose and more to gain.\n\n\n\n**Strategic value: Intel is more than a company\u2014it\u2019s infrastructure**\n\n\n\nIntel is more than a chipmaker. It\u2019s the backbone of America\u2019s technological sovereignty.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the only US company with cutting-edge node ambitions\n\n\n\nIt provides CPUs for defense, aviation, infrastructure, and edge computing\n\n\n\nIts survival is seen as a national interest\n\n\n\nWhile this doesn\u2019t guarantee profits, it guarantees protection. Intel\u2019s valuation has a floor \u2014 and, when the cycle turns, its ceiling could be much higher than its current valuation.\n\n\n\n**Valuation Snapshot: 2025 (as of May)**\n\n\n\nMetrics: Intel AMD\n\nMarket Cap \\~$130B \\~$260B\n\nTotal Assets \\~$190B \\~$70B\n\nExpected P/E \\~33x \\~45x\n\nR&D Spending (TTM) \\~$17B \\~$6B\n\nRevenue (TTM) \\~$55B \\~$23B\n\n\n\nIf the semiconductor cycle turns, as it has historically, and Intel\u2019s foundry and AI businesses are able to succeed, this valuation gap may seem absurd in hindsight.\n\n\n\n**Bottom line: $18 is too cheap, but $38 isn\u2019t too expensive**\n\nIntel\u2019s 2022-2023 collapse was painful but also cleansing. Now it stands on the brink of a new chapter \u2014 AI, independent foundry, and a return to competitive execution.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, AMD, while still great, may have peaked in its narrative power.\n\n\n\nSo the question remains:\n\n\n\nWhen the cycle turns, will Intel \u2014 the undervalued giant \u2014 make a strong comeback? And if so, where will AMD go when the music stops?",

        "selftext": "Just two-and-a-half weeks after agreeing to suspend tariffs, both countries are using export controls to disrupt each other\u2019s key industries.\n\nAfter stepping back this month from an escalating and dangerous war of tariffs, the United States and China are now threatening to undermine their uneasy truce.\n\nOn May 12, the countries announced after weekend meetings in Geneva that they would suspend most of their recently imposed tariffs. Since then, however, both governments have shown that they are still prepared to wield controls over critical exports as weapons against one another, with moves that are potentially even more damaging to trade and global supply chains.\n\nChina has restricted its exports of rare earth magnets, which are crucial for cars, semiconductors, aircraft and many other applications. Close to 90 percent of the world\u2019s rare earth metals, including magnets, are produced in China.\n\nAnd the United States on May 13 banned the latest semiconductors from Huawei, a Chinese electronics giant. Then on Wednesday, President Trump suspended the shipment of American semiconductors and some aerospace equipment needed for China\u2019s commercial aircraft, the C919, a signature project in China\u2019s push toward economic self-reliance.\n\nThe increasing use of export controls by both countries amounts to supply chain warfare, interrupting the flow of key components that the other country must have to operate huge industries that employ large numbers of workers.\n\nLast week, Ford Motor temporarily closed a factory in Chicago that makes Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles after one of its suppliers ran out of the magnets. In most new cars, the magnets are used in dozens of electric motors that operate brake and steering systems, fuel injectors and even power seats.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/business/china-us-export-controls.html?unlocked_article_code=1.K08.qzu2.yGYMUCkd6edC&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare",

        "selftext": "Alright, looked into **CoreWeave (CRWV)**. It's an \"AI Hyperscaler\".. gives GPU (Nvidia) for AI stuff. Stock went nuts since IPO (like 300% up) \u00a0\n\n**Quick Take:** CRWV: Big AI growth, Nvidia likes them. BUT huge debt, only 2 big clients (MSFT, OpenAI), and weird deals with Nvidia & Applied Digital where they invest in each other.\n\n**The Good:**\n\n* **AI Demand:** Selling GPU power for AI. Revenue shot up: $229M (2023) to maybe $8B (2025 est).Q1 2025 rev $981.6M, +420% YoY.\u00a0\n* **Nvidia Favored?** Gets Nvidia's new GPUs (GB200s) early. Nvidia invested, owns \\~7%.\u00a0\n* **Huge Contracts:** $10B Microsoft deal (MSFT is 72% of Q1 rev!).\\~$16B from OpenAI.\u00a0\n* **Stock Surge:** Stock jumped big after IPO from AI hype & news.\u00a0\n\n**The Bad:**\n\n* **Massive Debt:** Over $12.7B raised (equity/debt) by end 2024, liabilities >$18.8B Q1 2025. Interest could be $2B+/year.S-1 said \"material weaknesses in internal control\". Not great. \u00a0\n* **No Profit:** Big revenue, still big losses. Net loss $863M (2024), $314.6M (Q1 2025).\u00a0\n* **Few Customers:** MSFT is 72% of revenue. OpenAI other main one. Risky. \u00a0\n* **Nvidia Reliance:** All GPUs from Nvidia. If Nvidia has issues, CRWV does too. \u00a0\n\n**The Weird Loops:**\n\n* **Nvidia:**\n   * Nvidia investor (\\~7% stake).\u00a0\n   * CRWV buys all GPUs from Nvidia. So NVDA invests, CRWV buys NVDA chips. \u00a0\n   * NVDA *did* pay CRWV for services ($320M deal 2023).Now NVDA says not a customer, and Q1 rev from them <10%. So NVDA invests -> CRWV buys NVDA GPUs -> NVDA *used to* pay CRWV. Circular. \u00a0\n* **Applied Digital (APLD):**\n   * CRWV has \\~$7B, 15yr lease deal with APLD for data centers.\u00a0\n   * CRWV also has warrants for \\~5.5% of APLD. So CRWV is big APLD customer AND investor. \u00a0\n\n**So?**\n\nIs CRWV a smart play with AI giants, or a debt bomb waiting to go off if partners, debt, or AI hype fails? They're racing to make cash from contracts to pay debt & upgrade GPUs before tech gets old.\u00a0\n\nWhat u think? Big win or big fail?\n\n*(NFA, my summary, do ur own DD.)*",

        "selftext": "# Introduction\n\nTempus is a technology company advancing precision medicine through the practical application of artificial intelligence in healthcare. ***With one of the world\u2019s largest libraries of multimodal data, and an operating system to make that data accessible and useful***, Tempus provides\u00a0AI-enabled\u00a0precision medicine solutions to physicians to deliver personalized patient care and in parallel facilitates discovery, development and delivery of optimal therapeutics. The goal is for each patient to benefit from the treatment of others who came before by providing physicians with tools that learn as the company gathers more data.\n\n**The company's focus is on developing Intelligent Diagnostics, using AI to personalize laboratory tests for more insightful results.**\n\nTempus AI's business model is built on three main product lines:\n\n**Genomics:** This involves providing next-generation sequencing (NGS) diagnostics, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) profiling, molecular genotyping, and other anatomic and molecular pathology testing. These services are offered to healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, researchers, and other third parties.5\n\n**Data and Services:** Tempus AI leverages its Genomics product line to create a de-identified database that is then commercialized to pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners.4 This data is used to support drug discovery and development through two key products:\n\n**Insights** (licensing and analysis of de-identified records) and **Trials** (matching patients to clinical trials).\n\n**AI Applications:** This product line focuses on the development and provision of algorithm-based diagnostics, software as a medical device, and clinical decision support tools. Revenue from AI Applications is currently reported within the Data and Services line item due to its immateriality.\n\nTempus AI believes that its position as both a healthcare provider and a technology company provides a significant advantage in the realm of precision medicine. The company emphasizes the importance of technology, investing heavily in its Platform to ensure efficient data generation, ingestion, and structuring. However, Tempus AI acknowledges the inherent risks and challenges associated with AI, such as accuracy, bias, data privacy, and cybersecurity. The company is also actively engaged in managing the legal and regulatory complexities surrounding AI in healthcare.\n\nA substantial majority of Tempus AI's genomic testing focuses on clinical applications, with oncology serving as the primary disease area. This emphasis on clinical oncology testing is evident in the significant revenue generated by the company from these services. Further solidifying its position, Tempus AI actively seeks to secure reimbursement for its oncology tests from both commercial payers and government programs like Medicare. The company has made progress in increasing average reimbursement rates for NGS tests in oncology, acknowledging that this aspect remains crucial for future growth and profitability. This widespread adoption of Tempus AI's oncology genomic testing services by physicians and hospital systems fuels a continuous influx of invaluable patient data. This data forms the cornerstone of the company's **\"walled garden\" data strategy**\u2014a key competitive advantage that provides Tempus AI with a unique and expansive dataset for analysis and innovation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis discussion will describe how Tempus AI will be a world leading health agentic AI because of its following moat:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Walled off data.** Data outside public domain so no other AI can train on it.

This extensive, de-identified database is a key asset that provides the company with a significant competitive advantage, or \"moat,\" in the healthcare data market.\n\nHere's how this data exclusivity contributes to Tempus AI's moat:\n\n**Data Acquisition:** Tempus AI primarily obtains patient data through its Genomics product line, where it performs next-generation sequencing (NGS) diagnostics and other molecular pathology testing for healthcare providers, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies This direct involvement in the testing process allows the company to capture valuable patient data at its source.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Data Structuring and De-identification:** Tempus AI has developed a proprietary technology platform and operating system, referred to as its Platform, which structures and de-identifies the data collected through its Genomics product line1.... This process ensures the data is usable for research and commercialization while complying with privacy regulations.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Data Commercialization:** The de-identified database is then commercialized through Tempus AI's Data and Services product line, specifically its Insights and Trials products. Insights involves licensing de-identified datasets to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for drug discovery and development6.... Trials focuses on matching patients to clinical trials based on their genomic and clinical data7.\n\n**Limited Data Sharing:** Tempus AI's data licensing agreements typically grant limited, non-exclusive licenses to its customers, restricting their ability to share the data with other parties8.... This controlled access to the data helps to preserve its value and exclusivity.\n\nThe **limited access to Tempus AI's data by other AI companies creates a significant barrier to entry in the market**. Competitors would need to replicate the company's extensive data collection and structuring efforts to develop comparable products.\n\nTempus AI also recognizes the importance of **continuously expanding its database** to maintain its competitive edge2.... The company actively works to:\n\n**Acquire New Customers:** Tempus AI's sales force focuses on building relationships with physicians and hospital systems to promote the adoption of its Genomics testing services10.\n\n**Expand Partnerships:** The company seeks to expand collaborations with existing customers to increase data flow and access to more diverse patient populations10....\n\n**Explore New Disease Areas:** Tempus AI is actively expanding its business beyond oncology into other disease areas, such as neuropsychiatry and cardiology12.... This expansion will further enhance the diversity and value of its database.\n\nHowever, Tempus AI also acknowledges **potential challenges** to its data-driven business model\n\n**Data Access and Privacy:** The company's reliance on healthcare providers and other third parties to obtain patient data in a compliant manner poses a risk. Failures in data privacy compliance could affect Tempus AI's ability to use and commercialize the data.\n\n**Competition for Data Sources:** Tempus AI faces competition from other companies and research institutions for access to valuable patient data.\n\n**Evolving Regulations:** The regulatory landscape surrounding patient data privacy is constantly changing, potentially impacting the company's ability to collect, use, and share data.\n\nOverall, Tempus AI's walled-garden approach to patient data provides the company with a substantial competitive advantage in the healthcare data market. However, the company must navigate the complexities of data access, privacy, and evolving regulations to maintain its data moat and continue its growth trajectory.\n\n# Investment Powerhouses Buy Into TEM\n\n# Softbank and Larry Ellison Involvement with Health Agentic\n\n\n\nLarry Ellison has describes how he foresees part of the 500B in AI infrastructure being built being used for health Agentic.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/21/trump-ai-openai-oracle-softbank.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/21/trump-ai-openai-oracle-softbank.html)\n\nThis vision closely aligns with Tempus AI business model.\u00a0 Moreover, Softbank CEO, is also an investor in Tempus.\n\n[https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20240627](https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20240627)\n\n# Nancy Pelosi and her Husband have call options in TEM\n\n\n\nPeople with close ties to the President and the President\u2019s vision for AI in America have deep interests in Tempus AI\n\n# Growth\n\nTempus AI has shown significant growth year over year.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TEM/financials/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TEM/financials/)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTempus AI presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its unique position at the intersection of two high-growth sectors: **healthcare and artificial intelligence**.

        "selftext": "Sable Offshore Corp.\n\nI've been working on this for a few days, and I wanted to share. \n\nBackground: Santa Ynez Unit was an asset owned and operated by Exxon since the late 1960s, and was Exxon's most productive US asset producing between 10-20 million barrels of oil per year at a low cost of production of about $16 a barrel. Exxon was forced to shut down production since June 2015 due to a pipeline leak of 2,400 barrels of oil into the Pacific Ocean (Exxon Valdez was 10 million gallons for comparison). Exxon was unable to resume production due to California regulations (footnote at bottom). This is where Sable comes in. Sable purchased ExxonMobil\u2019s Santa Ynez Unit assets for $643 million, with a PV-10 of $10B. Sable has since made considerable regulatory progress and is expected to begin hydrotesting the Pipeline in January 2025 in advance of a potential restart of production in q1 2025. Sable must pass a Federal court ordered consent decree which which includes granting of waivers by the Office of the State Fire Marshal (OSFM) which has outlined 6 steps for Sable to complete before being able to start operations. Per OSFM, Sable is now on steps 5 and 6 which are deferred maintenance and a startup plan which OSFM has provided a detailed outline for anyone interested. Sable initially met obstacles from Santa Barbara County but settled with Sable to avoid a lawsuit due to loss of income which could bankrupt the county (more below). California State Fire Marshal Daniel Berlant approved a key pipeline-corrosion-control plan submitted by the Sable and granted safety waivers on December 17. The approval by the fire marshal starts begins a 60-day review by a federal hazardous materials agency. If the agency has no objections, the waiver will take effect in mid-February.\n\nThe California State Lands Commission is currently processing applications to reassign four leases in state waters from ExxonMobil, the previous owner of the Santa Ynez Unit (SYU), to Sable. State Lands has no timeline in mind for this decision, said Sheri Pemberton, their spokesperson; however, the SYU may restart without these lease assignments.\n\nAsset: Santa Ynez Unit is three offshore platforms located in Federal waters north of Santa Barbara, California with 112 wells (90 producers, 12 injectors, 10 idle); in shallow water of 900-1200ft. Sable has a substantial resource base with 646 million barrels equivalent of oil and a PV-10 of $10B.\n\nThesis:\n\nOwnership thinks it can bring production up to at least 10 million barrels in 2025 (28,000 barrels a day), and production up to 20 million barrels a year by 2028 while having minimal long term capital expenditures of about $150M per year with maintenance capex of about $30M per year. With improvements in drilling technology over the past decade, production could possibly be up to 30 million barrels a year. With oil priced at $70/b, 10 million barrels of oil would imply annual EBIT of $400 million and potentially up to $1.2B of EBIT based on increased production capacity on $70/b oil. This is a cash flow yield ranging between 20-63% given the current market cap is $2.0B and an enterprise value of $2.5B. \n\nCalifornia oil production currently stands at 283,000 barrels per day, so Sable would be a moderate boost to California supply which currently still gets most of its oil from Middle East suppliers along with Canada and Alaska due to consumption of >4 million barrels per day. Given California's increasing reliance on foreign oil (will also lose a lot from Alaska in the next couple years) a supplier in state is becoming increasingly necessary. Furthermore, Sable is operating under 16 federal offshore leases. California has limited jurisdiction. With a pro-oil production administration coming into office, this should provide further assistance toward operational success.\n\nManagement plans to institute aggressive shareholder return program:\r\n\u2012 Target fixed quarterly dividend of $1/share with a $2.50/share upside\r\n\u2012 Opportunistically repurchase shares with excess cash\r\n\u2012 Maintain conservative leverage profile by aggressively paying down debt\n\nBuffett and Munger's thesis on Occidental Petroleum is investing in a business with known large oil reserves (in the case of Occidental their reserves in Permain Basin), having minimal capex, and returning maximum cash flows to shareholders. Most oil companies don't operate this way historically. However, Occidental and now Sable are focused on limiting capex and returning maximum value to shareholders. \n\nChairman/CEO:\nJames C. Flores is the CEO and Chairman of Sable Offshore: -Leading Flores & Rucks, Inc. in 1994 \n-Chairman and CEO of Plains Resources Inc. in 2001 \n-Chairman, CEO, and President of PXP, which was acquired by Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. in 2013 \n-Vice Chairman of FCX and Chairman and CEO of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC until April 2016 \n\nFlores has extensive experience in the industry and his family spent their own money to own approximately 20% of the company, so they have a huge incentive for the success of this business.\n\nCurrent balance sheet:\n288M cash\n344M in current assets\n\n259M in warrant liabilities \n814M Senior Secured Term Loan\n1.3B in total liabilities \n\nValuation:\n\nBear cases: If production is not resumed by January 1, 2026, the terms of the asset acquisition with ExxonMobil Corporation would potentially result in the assets being reverted to ExxonMobil Corporation without any compensation to Sable which would be a large loss of capital. A drop in long term oil prices to $60/b without increasing production past 10M annual barrels, $28/b total operating cost, and $50M in maintenance capex would provide 105M in annual free cash flow but given the current $1B in net debt, the valuation would be hard to determine, certainly <$1B.\n\nBase case: $285M in annual free cash flow ($70/b oil on 10 billion barrels annually and $26/b total costs with 16.4% royalty) and rising to 20M barrels by 2028 for 634M in FCF for a $6.27 billion valuation $70.32/share.\n\nBull case: 285M in FCF in 2025 growing to $1.5 billion in annual free cash flow by 2030 ($100/b oil on 35m barrels annually with $20/b total costs on $30M maintenance capex by 2030 with 16.4% royalty). $13.58B current valuation. Price $152.30/share.\n\nRisks:\n\n1. Regulatory hurdles. While significant progress has been made, Sable has still not officially cleared regulatory hurdles required to begin operation.\n\n2. California political environment. There is a reason oil companies abandoned California. There is a known hostility toward the fossil fuel industry. \n\n3. Sable is leveraged to the price of oil. A global drop in oil prices could severely hurt cash flows. \n\n4. Ownership execution. While management is experienced in the G&E sector, they still have no track record with Santa Ynez.\n\nCatalyst:\n\n1. Clearing regulation is the single biggest hurdles. If Sable can begin operations, this company probably goes up >50% to >$30/share.\n\n2. Proving operations. If management can deliver on their expectations of $1/quarter dividend then the stock should be >$40/share which is almost a double.  \n\nEdited January 10, 2025: \n\nFootnote 1: ExxonMobil submitted several proposals to the Santa Barbara County including one to truck oil from its offshore facilities to refineries in Santa Maria and Kern County and another to install 16 new safety valves on the existing pipeline. The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors denied ExxonMobil\u2019s trucking proposal in March of 2022 and couldn\u2019t take action on the safety valves due to a tie vote. The ruling was upheld by a federal court in 2023. However, Exxon was already in the process of selling Santa Ynez asset with the effective purchase price to Sable of January 1, 2022. It is hard to determine exactly why Exxon appears to exit California operations prior to a ruling from Santa Barbara County or a federal court was made. Within the consent decree, one of the conditions to resume operations was that the previous pipeline operator (Plains All American) needed to be compliant enterprise wide which could mean the new operator would also need to be compliant enterprise wide. Furthermore, Exxon incurred about $80 million a year in costs to maintain the non-producing assets. The U.S. last December approved a requirement that California's offshore platforms be removed upon retirement, and owners are not allowed to leave the infrastructure in the ocean. It would cost Exxon hundreds of millions further to decommission their asset. However, given the regulatory progress Sable has made, it is not unreasonable to think Exxon would reconsider taking back the assets if production is not resumed by January 1, 2026.\n\nFootnote 2: The most recent financial guidance calls for 40-50 million of maintenance capex (workover and ESP), with $70-80 million in rig & facilities refurbishment which should be completed by 2027. Workover Capex will decrease to about $30 million annually while development drilling Capex for new wells will be about 120 million annually through 2034. Exxon averaged $130M in capex the 2 years prior to closing in 2015 at this site. It is a bit unclear what the true maintenance cost is for this site. \n\nFootnote 3: It seems to me CCC doesn't have any actual power once their cease and desist order expires in February and probably can't stop production. Having said that, the CCC is notoriously difficult to deal with and are known for delaying projects and being very heavy handed.  I haven't found anything specific about whether Sable needs permits from Fish & Wildlife, but I could plausibility seeing them being necessary. Sable submitted an Integrated Contintency Plan to Fish and Wildlife waiting for approval, but I haven't been able to find anything else. \n\nFootnote 4: CEO Jim Flores has played a central role in building a number of large oil and gas companies over the years prior to Freeport\u2019s acquisition of Plains. Flores holds degrees in petroleum land management and finance from Louisiana State University, and has more than 25 years of experience in the oil and gas industry. Before heading Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC as the company\u2019s chairman and CEO, James Flores headed PXP.  During Flores ten-year tenure, PXP saw production and proved reserves grow 420% and 174%, respectively.\n\nFootnote 5: Sable guides for Lease Operating Expense\t of $17.00-$19.00 in 2025 with Gathering, Processing & Transportation costs of $2.50-$3.50 and Administrative\tcosts of $4.50\u2012$5.50. Total production costs of $24-28/b. I suspect this number is conservative by management and given the efficiency improvements they can make, lifting costs can get as low as $10-15/b with total expenses being maybe as low as $17-22/b.\n\nFootnote 6: Santa Barbara Department of Planning and Development eventually conceded that it \"does not have jurisdiction over Pacific Pipeline Company\u2019s (\u201cPPC\u201d) installation of 16 new safety valves based on a 1988 ruling Celeron Pipeline Company of California v. County of Santa Barbara given the valves are required by state law, is related to the operation of an interstate pipeline, and is one of more feet underground. SB acknowledged OSFM and PHMSA have sole authority over the construction and operation of the pipeline. Finally, SB approved the transfer of ownership and permits to Sable in September 2023.\n\nFootnote 7: The reason I think Sable can grow from baseline of 15 million barrels a year to 30+ million because there are currently 90 producing wells with an additional 10 idle wells and Sable has identified >100 additional infill development opportunities, which could double the number of wells and also more than double resource extraction by adding 354 million barrels of oil equivalent. In addition, Sable can add Electric Submersible Pump (ESP) on existing wells to improve efficiency. ",

I think recession concerns are overblown given the following:\n\n* Absolute levels of unemployment remain very low\n* Meeting inflation targets are important for encouraging discretionary spending for lower income populations so that buying power won't be continuously eroded and we can move past this tightening cycle\n* The Fed has the ability to reduce interest rates significantly if warranted\n* Reduction in mortgage rates will allow: (1) existing homeowners to reduce interest burden and increase discretionary spending and (2) stimulate big ticket purchases (e.g. cars, homes, etc.)\n* Reduced bond yields means equities become more attractive in comparison. In the short run, the carry trade has largely unwinded from its highs in July 2024 and further downside risk is less than before - [see chart here from ING](https://think.ing.com/articles/jpy-peeling-back-the-carry-trade-onion/).\n\n**META specific thoughts:**\n\n* **Earnings:**\n   * Just crushed earnings expectations, their advertising business continues to run strong with user base growth. They stated that they have seen early benefits from their CAPEX spend on AI (not sure if it reaches desired ROI yet however).\n* **Reasonable valuation in the short run:**\n   * Currently trading at \\~25 PE (TTM) and forward PE is \\~21 to 24 depending on EPS forecasts. [Source linked here](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/meta/forecast/). For context, Meta hit its lowest PE of 14 in December 2022 when people thought Meta wouldn't exist anymore due to ad spend concerns, apple privacy updates, and issues with facebook engagement.\n   * Compared to other tech companies investing in AI, Meta (along with Google) has one of the lowest P/Es with a comparable growth rate. Relative to its peers, its PEG ratio is lower as well. However, I think some of this difference is explained by its reliance on ad spend which is cyclical and less resilient in downturns.\n* **Long term bets:**\n   * Meta has invested in long term bets in AI and Virtual reality which have yet to pay off and are considered a cost burden.\n   * For example, in their recent earnings call, they've talked about using AI stand-in personas to help influencers and small businesses answer questions to followers. If they become the \"small business or personal\" AI, then they can deepen relationships with users and monetize in ways beyond ads through reoccuring services revenue. Reoccuring revenue and proving monetization of AI will give it a boost in EPS given investors value this type of revenue more.\n   * I believe Meta is trying to move away from reliance on ads and provide value to users in ways that cannot be pulled away as easily (similar to other SaaS companies)\n* **Spending Risks:**\n   * CAPEX is large which has a future drag on EPS, but I think they can scrap their VR initiatives if needed if cost efficiency is required.\n   * If AI doesn't work out, EPS growth will be harmed in the outer years (assuming near term growth is not expected to be fueled by AI).\n* **Economic Risks:**\n   * Short term dependence on ad spend which is cylical and impacted during recessions\n   * Chinese companies spending a lot on Meta for ads - this might go away\n   * I think given interest rates are coming down - hopefully any softness will be alleviated quickly.\n\n**TLDR:** Short term business is reasonably valued and forward valuations aren't priced for explosive AI monetization. This results in upside both from an EPS and P/E perspective if there is no prolonged economic downturn and especially if new AI products show early chutes of monetization. Would appreciate any thoughts/challenges to this from other investors.",

At current prices the stock would trade at 17.6x operating income.\n\nMETA's earnings are stellar and this is despite this massive money-losing segment. If the bet turns out correct, huge upside to earnings. If it turns out to go nowhere, well, you get a natural boost from not throwing money into a black hole. Zuckerberg has a history of excellent capital allocation given the success of this company. Hopefully he is correct on this. (I'm skeptical of VR)\n\nAlso, it's interesting to point out: people were critical of META doing buybacks in 2021 before the stock had collapsed. The highest stock price META had achieved before the crash was ~$380 in September '21. Today the share price is ~$490, or ~30% higher. If you call that 3 years between then and now, that's a roughly 9% annualized return. But we can actually look at their actual buying price.  [From this source](https://x.com/borrowed_ideas/status/1819028343280599550), the average buy price in 2021 was $330, which comes out to ~13% annualized return.\n\nSo the buybacks during seemingly bubble territory turned out to be decent capital allocation in the end. The S&P 500 is only about ~20% higher than it's peak valuation, so those buybacks were market-beating.\n\n(Now consider the buybacks in 2022 at $173 average, before the 182% rally to today's share price...)",

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [US Treasuries Fall on Signs That Trump Will Dilute April Tariffs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-24/us-treasuries-fall-on-signs-that-trump-will-dilute-april-tariffs)\n\nThis has resulted in a market bounce and overall means that markets will likely NOT be as impacted by tariffs as they were expecting. \n\nThe tariff game Trump is playing reminds me of that scene from the office: \"You have no idea the physical toll three vasectomies have on a person! Snip Snap! Snip Snap! Snip Snap!\" -Michael Scott. \n\nAnyway back to the watchlist. \n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- Seen a significant bounce in TSLA due to the news of the lessened (supposedly) future tariffs\u2014interested in seeing if we can break above $260 at open; otherwise, not interested and likely still will be negatively biased. This might actually be reacting a little positively due to BYD's blowout earnings. BYD reported $107B annual revenue for the year and are close to TSLA's profit! Mainly concerned in the long run about margin compression due to pricing cuts, increased competition in the EV space, macro headwinds, and of course, Elon making fork sculptures in the White House but no one appreciating them. \n\n[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\\- MicroStrategy buys 6,911 more of the underlying, now holds over 506k, currently at 2x premium. Nothing too interesting to note beyond the typical upwards move from whenever MSTR announces a buy of the underlying. We've bounced slightly off the lows, but worth noting that the underlying is also rose from news that Trump might use his gold holdings to buy more. I always keep in mind MSTR's heavy dependence on underlying performance, regulatory scrutiny, and volatility, of course. Related tickers to watch on this are RIOT and COIN/HOOD.\n\n[**LUNR (Intuitive Machines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d)\\- Reported strong Q4 and FY24 results. Q4 revenue of $54.7M (+80% YoY) and FY24 revenue of $228.0M (nearly 3x YoY).\n\nBacklog reached $328.3M (+22% YoY), with **projected positive run-rate Adj. EBITDA by year-end**. Overall backlog seemed to be the second most important factor, signifies that there is future revenue and they are far more financially stable than anticipated and even profitable by year end! I have a very small position long. Going to bail if we break below $7 but overall I think there are many tailwinds that can help LUNR. **L**UNR's main risks are execution risk tied to lunar missions (beginning of this month saw the stock fall close to 50% in a single day), contract delays, reliance on government funding, and high R&D intensity with limited margin buffer/no defined return. Also watching RKLB on this. \n\n[**AZEK (The AZEK Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AZEK&p=d)\\- James Hardie to acquire AZEK in a cash/stock deal valued at $8.75B (including debt). AZEK holders to receive $26.45 cash + 1.034 JHX shares, totaling \\~$53/share (as of premarket prices)**.** These hybrid stock/cash acquisitions can fluctuate in price because of how the acquirer pays with their own stock. Typical M&A risks apply such as integration risk, housing market softness, FX exposure (James Hardie also trades in Australia IIRC), regulatory risk, etc.\n\n**Earnings:** [**OKLO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKLO&p=d)",

        "selftext": "This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nWatching the typical market/volatility stocks in addition to the tariff play stocks.\n\nNews: [China says there are no trade negotiations with the US over Tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tariff-negotiations-trump-481ff4402f5c34776ffcb8ced4c8ae42)\n\n[**F (Ford)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)**,** [**GM (General Motors)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&p=d)**,** [**STLA (Stellantis)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=STLA&p=d)\\- President Trump announced the possibility of increasing the existing 25% tariff on cars imported from Canada, aiming to \"reduce reliance on foreign car imports and promote domestic auto manufacturing\". This news happened afterhours yesterday (which is why all the car companies had a weird spike at the close). This is a rehash of the 25% tariff on all imported cars which was announced ahead of 'Liberation Day', so I don't think this should ultimately shouldn't have a massive effect on these stocks unless there are additional tariffs. 25% tariffs on imports of automobiles/automobile parts have been known for a while, so at this point I'll wait to see how car companies react at the open. The highest risk at the moment are retaliatory tariffs from Canada.\n\n[**INDA (India ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INDA&p=d)\\- Pakistan has suspended all trade with India, closed its airspace to Indian airlines, and rejected India's claims regarding a Kashmir attack, escalating tensions between the two nations. The geopolitical tension between the two countries has been going on for close to 100 years, watching to see if there's more escalation between the two countries.\n\n[**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&p=d)\\- American Airlines reported Q1 earnings with an EPS of -$0.59 vs. -$0.69 expected and revenue of $12.6B vs. $12.5B expected. The company withdrew its FY outlook and provided weak Q2 guidance based on current demand trends. Interested in $9 level. Overall bearish but no position. AAL has fallen close to 50% since February, so I'm mainly interested to see if there is any chance of economic turnaround. There are some knock-on effects from tariffs due to fuel costs/economic prosperity of travelers for discretionary spending. Risks are typically continued persistently weak demand and operational disruptions (further plane accidents).\n\n[**ZIM (ZIM Integrated Shipping Services)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ZIM&p=d)**,** [**SBLK (Star Bulk Carriers)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SBLK&p=d)**,** [**MATX (Matson, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MATX&p=d)\\- Flexport (a supply chain logistics platform) reported a 60% decline in ocean freight bookings from China to the U.S. since new tariffs took effect, leading carriers to cancel a quarter of sailings and reroute capacity to other trade lanes. Overall more of a swing trade for the long term rather than a day trade, interested primarily in MATX. The shipping industry is experiencing significant disruptions due to trade policy changes; we'll likely see earnings affect a ton of these stocks and I'm interested if they give outlook during earnings.\n\n**Earnings:** [**GOOG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d), [**TMUS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TMUS&p=d), [**GILD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GILD&p=d)",

Announces that profit could fall by $2B or more due to tariffs and lower EV demand.\n\n**Technicals:** Pretty much broke the $10 level it's been trading around since August, watching to see if it'll sell off more by the open. Highly/infinitely liquid.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The entire automotive industry is challenged by tariffs. F guided lower for 2025.\n\n**Risks:** Obviously these are one of the bigger movers from Mexico tariffs (most cars are assembled in Mexico then shipped to the US).\n\n**Related Tickers:** GM, TSLA, STLA.\n\n**Offhand Comments:** Ford's outlook reflects the broader industry's apprehension about geopolitical factors affecting operations and profitability. Interesting to see how other car companies react to earnings as well.\n\n**Ticker:** [**ARM (Arm Holdings)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARM&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** ARM reported EPS of $0.39 vs. $0.34 expected. Revenue of $983 million vs. $959M expected. Buoyed by Deepseek ban news, most likely as well.\n\n**Technicals:** Was down roughly 8% after earnings, but seems to be somewhat recovering after Deepseek news.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Semiconductor sector is experiencing heightened demand, especially after PLTR's comments that the AI train will never stop. We're seeing growth in data center applications, the main driver of semis purchases.\n\n**Risks:** Despite strong performance, Arm's lowered full-year revenue forecast has led to a 6% drop in its shares.\n\n**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC.\n\n**Ticker:** [**RBLX (Roblox Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Roblox Corporation reported earnings with an EPS of -$0.33 vs. -$0.46 expected. Revenue of $988.2M vs. $967.2M expected.\n\n**Technicals:** $50 is the clear level here, note that earnings were released premarket rather than aftermarket yesterday. Seems to be a massive overreaction selloff (but has recovered somewhat).\n\n**Risks:** IIRC Roblox isn't profitable yet- they're focusing on growth/revenue over profits, but most of their costs are outside their control (platform fees like the Apple store, developers, infrastructure for trust/safety for minors).\n\n**Related Tickers:** EA, TTWO.\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has temporarily suspended its API service top-ups due to server resource constraints. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to ban DeepSeek's chatbot application from government-owned devices over data security concerns.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The AI industry is under increased scrutiny regarding data security and geopolitical tensions but that's grown more laissez-faire under Trump. DeepSeek's service suspension and potential U.S. government ban helps American chip makers and NVDA especially, due to their continued dominance.\n\n**Risks:** Deepseek getting banned will likely lead to greater reliance on American AI chatbots, spurring growth in American semis manufacturers.\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM.\n\n**Offhand Comments:** (I am currently long).\n\n**Ticker:** [**SWKS (Skyworks Solutions)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWKS&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.57 expected. Revenue of $1.07B vs 1.07B expected. Reports $2B stock buyback plan.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching the $60 level, we've had a brutal fall from $90->$60. If we get closer I'm interested in some small bounce depending on volume/size of the move.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SWKS supplies some of the chips for Apple's iPhone, and their iPhone sales haven't done too well recently- thus this has a knock-on effect by affecting SWKS's sales.\n\n**Risks:** SWKS projected a revenue decline for the mobile segment and issued a lower profit forecast. They stated they anticipated a \"mid-to-high teens decline in mobile.\"\n\n**Offhand Comments: A lot of the firms that manufacture parts for the iPhone are linked in performance, especially if the iPhone is the main source of their sales- would be interesting to formulate some trading ideas from that.**\n\n**Related Tickers:** QCOM, AVGO, TXN.\n\n**Earnings today:** [**AMZN**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&p=d).",

Secretary Lutnick announced yesterday \"Tariffs compromise announcement will likely come tomorrow\", so will be on the lookout for that.\n\nNews: [Trump Hails Tariffs as US Economy Barrels Into Trade Wars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-to-tout-tariffs-unveil-energy-mineral-projects-in-speech)\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)**,** [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)**,** [**SMH (Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)**,** [**SOXL (3x Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SOXL&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Trump has called for an end to the CHIPS Act Subsidy Program (instead preferring tariffs).\n\n**Technicals:** Short biased. Obviously this takes away a lot of investment in semis companies. Extremely negative catalyst but unlikely it will get repealed due to how much bipartisan support it had.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The CHIPS and Science Act gave $280B in new funding to boost domestic research/manufacturing of semis in the US, and also aimed to strengthen supply chain resilience against China and widely considered to be a success because it spurred the development/dominance in the semis sector in America.\n\n**Risks:** If this gets repealed, we're likely going to see a pretty large pullback in the semis. Obviously this is dependent on what the tariffs Trump touts will do as well. [I wrote a little more about my take on a different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j437g9/trump_calls_for_end_to_52_billion_chips_act/) but overall more of the same (I think it's a terrible idea).\n\n**Ticker:** [**GM (General Motors)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&p=d)**,** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)**,** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is considering granting relief from the recently imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\n**Technicals:** We've seen all three stocks (GM especially) make gains due to this announcement, will watch at open for volume.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The automotive industry in US/Canada/Mexico involves the most economic/manufacturing cooperation in the USMCA, they're the most obvious beneficiaries of this potential catalyst.\n\n**Risks:** If they don't actually give relief, then will likely pullback- cars are one of the most affected products of tariffs and pretty much every car company has spoken about tariffs on their earnings calls.\n\n**Ticker:** [**IBIT (IBIT)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBIT&p=d)**,** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**,** [**HOOD (Robinhood Markets)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that Trump plans to grant the main biggest CC a \"unique status\" within the Bitcoin reserve strategy, which will be unveiled at the White House Crypto Summit on Friday.\n\n**Technicals:** We've seen the underlying spike close to 8-9% since yesterday, watching $90K level. Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.\n\n**Risks:** Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday. I personally see this more of a \"buy on hype\" kind of catalyst, unless there's an announcement of something extremely bullish I'm not sure how much more this will move the needle.\n\n**Ticker:** [**HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HII&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Trump has announced initiatives aimed at strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry to counter China's dominance, spoke about the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding and the introduction of special tax incentives.\n\n**Technicals:** None that I'm particularly interested in, this is a longer-term play.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China produces over half of the world's merchant vessels, this is more of a play to reduce reliance on foreign-shipping.\n\n**Risks:** There's a chance that this will never happen, Trump tried to create a \"Cybersecurity Department\" in his first term but that was never formally created and we kept those duties spread out between the FBI/DHS/NSA. But we also have the Space Force so... stay tuned.\n\n**Earnings:** [**MRVL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRVL&p=d), [**VEEV**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VEEV&p=d), [**ZS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ZS&p=d), [**MDB**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MDB&p=d)",

        "selftext": "This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!\n\nI am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.\n\nThe potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nYesterday was eventful, to say the least. Tariffs on Mexico/Canada are delayed, but we still have tariffs on China, and tariffs have been promised by Trump on the EU.\n\nNews: [As Trump Tariffs Take Effect, China Retaliates With Trade Measures Against U.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-tariffs-news?unlocked_article_code=1.uU4.ps2-.DRzgfM1GnN9i)\n\n**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.14 vs. $0.11 expected. Revenue of $828 million vs. $777 million expected. Management highlighted the power of AI and their sizable contracts, citing the nature of the AI war being winner-take-all.\n\n**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.\n\n**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic/aggresive in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned with current government leaders.\n\n**Related Tickers:** MSFT, GOOGL, IBM, AMZN\n\n**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Chinese AI company DeepSeek is reportedly preparing to switch to domestic GPUs to circumvent NVDA chip restrictions. DeepSeek has bypassed NVDA CUDA for certain operations, utilizing the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) language instead. Additionally, on February 2nd, DeepSeek, in collaboration with SiliconFlow and Huawei Cloud, launched DeepSeek-R1/V3 inference services on Huawei's Ascend AI chips. Huawei is also promoting its new Ascend AI processors to Chinese groups considering \"inference\" as an option.\n\n**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were \"supposed\" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the \"standard\" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).\n\n**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.\n\n**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM, TSM\n\n**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/(oil stocks, car stocks, etc).**\n\n**Catalyst:** U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, aiming to address issues related to drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs effective February 10, including a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine vehicles.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The imposition of these tariffs marks a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tension and more volatility to come through Trump tweets- we might see a trade war again (sigh) like we did in 2019. Not 100% sure if agricultural machinery will affect stocks like DE but will look into it.\n\n**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU, TCEHY, PDD\n\n**Offhand Comments:** There are going to be retaliation investigations against companies operating in America, INTC and GOOG have recently been announced as under investigation by China. But it's very important to remember which companies have a presence in China and which don't- for example, GOOG search hasn't worked in China since 2010 lol.\n\n**Ticker:** [**GRAB (Grab Holdings Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRAB&p=d)\n\n**Catalyst:** Grab Holdings Ltd. is considering a takeover of its Indonesian rival, GoTo Group, at a valuation of approximately $7 billion.\n\n**Technicals:** Watching $5 level, no bias. I'm not 100% sure if there's an actual \"acquisition\" share price for GoTo but will keep eyes peeled for that acquisition premium.\n\n**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The potential merger represents a significant consolidation in SEA's ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Mergers typically streamline operations and reduce competition, leading to improved profitability for the combined entity.\n\n**Risks:** The proposed merger may face regulatory hurdles, including antitrust concerns, which could delay or derail the deal. Standard M&A obstacles.\n\n**Related Tickers:** UBER, LYFT\n\n**Earnings today:** [**AMD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d), [**GOOG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d), [**MAT**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MAT&p=d), [**SNAP**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNAP&p=d)",

        "selftext": "Alibaba missed top and bottom line expectations for the June quarter of 2024 as it continues to face headwinds in its core e-commerce business amid rising competition and a cautious Chinese consumer.\n\nShares of Alibaba fell around 3.49% at 06:58 a.m. in premarket trade in the U.S.\n\nHere\u2019s how Alibaba did in the June quarter versus LSEG estimates:\n\nRevenue: 243.24 billion Chinese yuan ($34.01billion) versus 249.05 billion yuan expected.\n\nNet income: 24.27 billion yuan versus 26.91 billion yuan expected.\n\nRevenue was up 4% year-on-year, while net income dropped 29% year-on-year. Alibaba said the net income fall was \u201cprimarily due to a decrease in income from operations\u201d and \u201cincrease in impairment\u201d from its investments.\n\nAlibaba has been looking to reignite growth after a tumultuous 2023, when it carried out its largest-ever corporate structure overhaul. This was followed by high-profile management changes, with Eddie Wu taking over the reins as chief executive in September.\n\nThe e-commerce giant has been grappling with a cautious Chinese consumer, along with increased competition from rivals such as JD.com and Temu owner PDD.\n\nSince taking over the reins, Wu has been trying to get Alibaba\u2019s core China e-commerce business back on a stable footing. It\u2019s currently going through a transition phase where the company is planning to put more focus on third-party merchants selling via its platforms \u2014 Taobao and Tmall \u2014 in China, while reducing reliance on its direct sales business.\n\nWu has previously said the company intends to release new monetization features for its e-commerce platforms that should return the Taobao and Tmall business back to growth toward the latter half of 2025.\n\nIn the June quarter, sales from the Taobao and Tmall group, which represents Alibaba\u2019s China e-commerce business, fell 1% year-on-year to 113.37 billion yuan.\n\nMeanwhile, Alibaba\u2019s overseas online shopping businesses, such as Lazada and Aliexpress, continue to be a bright spot, with sales in the international e-commerce division up 32% year-on-year.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/alibaba-shares-dip-3percent-after-quarterly-earnings-miss-expectations-despite-cloud-acceleration.html",

                "body": "u/Bossie81\n\nI have a few questions:\n\n1. How is it that IBRX's accumulated deficit of $3.2 billion is more than half of Soon-Shiong's net worth, if he didn't deliberately saddle it with debt (I'm not saying he did; I'm just asking)?\n2. If IBRX only has enough cash and cash equivalents to fund operations through at least 12 months, doesn't that mean a share dilution is very likely in the near future? Wouldn't IBRX be \"cutting things a bit close\" if they don't do it within the next 3 months?\n3. The stock price is lower today than it was when the FDA approval was given. What does this mean for sales? Does it - for example - mean that other drugs are being preferred, over Anktiva? Does it mean that Anktiva's efficacy has been exaggerated, since it's not effective on its own but has to be taken alongside BCG?\n4. Which other drugs are competing with Anktiva in the treatment of NMIBC, and how do their sales compare with those of Anktiva?\n5. Are there any official dates or timelines by which UK approval is expected?\n6. You say his plane has been at Heathrow Airport for this month. Is it likely that he is pushing for UK approval, so he can then announce some shares dilution?",

Trials are extremely expensive,  I believe 505k - 150k per participant., depending on the type of drug/treatment.\n2. Yes. Share dilution is possible.  However, it is my opinion the will partner to create liquidity. Soon owns 80% of the stock,  so he has in interest too.\n3. Look at Akebia, Iovance,  Coherus, Xfor and others that had PDUFA/approval.  Approval means nothing,  IBRX was in the luxury position of being able to ship 2 weeks after approval. Unique. However, the market still needs to be informed, trained, insurance deals covered.  An approval, as with the given examples,  are in indication of future value. Especially when it does not concern Big Pharma.\n4. Keytruda and Opdivo (I believe).  If you look at Opdivo   wiki, you can see a approval path - I think  Anktiva has the same timeline.\n5. UK is my guess. Not fact.  It is simply logic.  The fastest to obtain.\n6. UK approval, in my opinion,  will go with a partnership.  I do not see how they can not. If they do not partner,  they will need to dilute. With Bio stock anything is possible.  You have to be willing to see red.  A partner can bee in many forms, but if this occurs there will be a big investment (my guess 500,000,000 minimum) and hefty milestone payments for each indication.",

        "selftext": "**If you stick with the first two of Buffett's investment tips over the past several weeks, then you are likely to become one of the beneficiaries of today's turnaround.**\n\n**So how well did you do?**\n\n**What stocks do you think Buffett or you should consider with these principles?**\n\n# Buffett's Investment Tips:\n\n**1. Wait...Then Pounce:**\n\nGiving the stock time to achieve a reasonable valuation, then moving when the market corrects\n\n**2. Stay the Course:**\n\nResist panicking at this point and selling your holdings when they falter...and at some point, they will.\n\n**3. Pick Businesses, Not Stocks:**\n\nWeigh and analyze the business behind a stock. Try to focus on businesses you understand and of which you have some knowledge.\u00a0\n\n\"Another priceless Buffett advisory comment is that you should plan to own a stock for at least 10 years, if not longer, keep in mind that a business will have time to evolve. \"If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes,\" he said in his 1996 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.\"\n\n# Buffett's six-step investment approach:\n\n**1. Company Performance:**\n\nROE (Return on Equity) = (Net Income \u00f7 Shareholder\u2019s Equity) X 100 from the past five to 10 years to analyze historical performance\n\n**2. Company Debt:**\n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\n**3. Profit Margins:**\n\nCalculated by dividing net income by net sales. Investors should look back at least five years for a good indication of historical profit margins.\n\n**4. Is the Company Public?**\n\nBuffett typically considers only companies that have been around for at least 10 years.\n\nValue investing requires identifying companies that have stood the test of time but are currently undervalued.\n\nThe value investor\u2019s job\u00a0is to determine how well the company can perform in the future.\n\n**5. Commodity Reliance:**\n\nAny characteristic that's hard to replicate is what Buffett calls a company\u2019s \u201cprotective moat,\u201d giving it a competitive advantage. The wider the moat, the tougher it is for a competitor to gain\u00a0market share\n\n**6. Is It Cheap?**\n\nDetermine a company\u2019s\u00a0intrinsic value\u00a0by analyzing several business fundamentals, including earnings, revenues, and assets.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/071801.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/071801.asp)",

        "selftext": "Trump\u2019s latest trade policies are hammering the markets\u2014S&P 500 down \\~9%, Nasdaq off \\~12%\u2014and it looks like he\u2019s doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he\u2019s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?\n\nThe **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:\n\n\u2705 **Tariffs as leverage** \u2013 forcing trade partners into more \u201creciprocal\u201d deals\n\n\u2705 **USMCA review (2026)** \u2013 questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly\n\n\u2705 **Hardline stance on China** \u2013 blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements\n\nHis strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**\u2014all of which are starting to bite.\n\nNot every company is hurting\u2014some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump\u2019s protectionist approach. Trump\u2019s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g \n\n* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits\n* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel\n* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power\n* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs\n* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge\n* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump\n* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners\n\nCompanies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g\n\n* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk\n* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins\n* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs\n* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production\n* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs\n* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers\n* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders \n\nAre you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?\n\n  \nTrump\u2019s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they \u201cimprove border security\u201d and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.\n\nThe problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can\u2019t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",

The other $23 billion is from the company\u2019s investments in\u00a0new plants and site expansions\u00a0since 2020, which has helped\u00a0ease supply shortages\u00a0of its popular drugs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis represents the largest pharmaceutical expansion investment in U.S. history,\u201d Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said at the event. \u201cWe\u2019re making these investments ... to prepare for the demand we anticipate for future pipeline medicines across our therapeutic areas.\u201d\n\nShares of the company rose more than 1% on Wednesday.\n\nThree of the future U.S. sites announced Wednesday will manufacture active ingredients in medications, such as tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly\u2019s obesity drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro.\u00a0Ricks noted that there is a \u201creal gap in supply chain in the U.S. as it relates to active ingredient availability in our country.\u201d\n\nThe fourth site will extend the company\u2019s global manufacturing network for future injectable therapies, he added.\n\nEli Lilly has not decided on where\u00a0the\u00a0four\u00a0new U.S.\u00a0sites will be located, Ricks said. The company will be accepting location submissions through March 13 and will announce decisions on new sites in the coming months.\n\nEli Lilly said the four new sites will create more than 3,000 jobs for workers such as engineers and scientists, along with 10,000 construction jobs as the plants are built. The company\u2019s other U.S. plants include sites in North Carolina, Indiana and Wisconsin.\n\nThe new investments aren\u2019t solely dedicated to Eli Lilly\u2019s current and future obesity and diabetes treatments. The company is charting its future beyond Zepbound and Mounjaro, with hopes to deliver drugs from its broad pipeline of products for\u00a0cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u00a0and other conditions.\n\nRicks said the company is optimistic about its pipeline across therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic health, oncology, immunology and neuroscience.\n\nStill, the new investments build on the success of Zepbound and Mounjaro, which share dominance of the booming market for so-called GLP-1 drugs with\u00a0Novo Nordisk\u2019s weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic. Some analysts expect the global obesity drug market to be worth\u00a0more than $150 billion annually\u00a0by the early 2030s, making it critical for both companies to maintain their share as other drugmakers scramble to join.\n\nDuring the event, Ricks took a shot at cheaper compounded versions of its injectable drugs, saying \u201cAmerica faces a growing threat from an influx of counterfeit and compounded medications.\u201d\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s efforts to boost the supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro aim to ensure that eligible patients are safely accessing those branded treatments instead of cheaper compounded versions. Patients flocked to those unapproved copycats when the branded drugs were in short supply, or if they didn\u2019t have insurance coverage for the costly treatments.\u00a0\n\nThe FDA has since\u00a0declared\u00a0the shortage of tirzepatide over, which will essentially bar many compounding pharmacies from making copycats.\u00a0\n\nHassett said the issue also \u201cdisturbs the White House\u201d because offshore producers of copycat drugs are \u201cthreatening lives in the U.S.\u201d\n\nRead More:\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/eli-lilly-to-invest-27-billion-in-new-us-manufacturing.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/eli-lilly-to-invest-27-billion-in-new-us-manufacturing.html)\n\n",

If these two situations play out. One very large, fast growing and huge potential having industries has a large gap waiting to be filled. Cloud computing. The largest cloud computing provider in Europe is OVH Groupe. Here are the numbers:\n\nMarketcap: 1.5B  \nAnnual Sales: 1B  \nSales growth 10% of which the cloud computing segment has a growth of 15%  \nOpearating cash flow: 370M  \nCAPEX: 340 (for expansion in capacity)  \nFree cash flow positive with 25M\n\nThus it trades at a price to operating cash flow of 4.8, while Amazon and Goolge trade above 3x that amount. Of course I'm taking operating cash flow as a measure because they are nearly investing everything back into assets that have a return on investment.\n\nLast year they announced a 350M share buy back program. The only thing I'm having trouble with is their service and product. I have never used it and don't know too much about it even after a bit of research. But considering their financials are great and the macro's could provide a huge tailwind, this is looking promising. I have been 100% cash since February 20th and have bought 10% yesterday into OVH Groupe. I'm thinking of buying more but am careful due to it being a small cap and not knowing the management and service provided well. Maybe other can chime in on what they know.",

        "selftext": "[What could stop the NVDIA frenzy?](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/08/26/what-could-stop-the-nvidia-frenzy)\n\n# What could stop the Nvidia frenzy?\n\n# Two contradictions could stymie the AI chipmaker-in-chief\n\nIF today\u2019s stockmarkets\u00a0have their version of the great wildebeest migration, it is the stampede of the Nvidia bulls. Wall Street is no Serengeti, and Jim Cramer\u2019s high-pitched narration no match for the dulcet tones of Sir David Attenborough. But in other respects investors\u2019 headlong rush into the American chipmaker\u2019s shares has been every bit as enthralling a spectacle.\n\nGalloping sales of Nvidia\u2019s artificial-intelligence (AI) processors have lifted its market capitalisation from $350bn at the start of 2023 to $1trn, then $2trn, and then, this summer, $3trn. In June it overtook Microsoft, an\u00a0AI-zealous software giant believed to be the biggest buyer of its chips, as\u00a0[the world\u2019s most valuable firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/06/20/nvidia-is-now-the-worlds-most-valuable-company). It proceeded to lose that title\u2014and $900bn in value\u2014amid the recent stockmarket panic, only to claw back most of its losses in the past few weeks. As the firm prepares to report its latest results on August 28th just about everyone expects another blow-out quarter. \u201cHow much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?\u201d Mr Cramer asked rhetorically on his\u00a0CNBC\u00a0show last week, referring to Nvidia\u2019s boss. These days the Nvidia bear appears to be an endangered species. Or, as Sir David might whisper, \u201cNot an\u00a0*Ursus nvidiaensis*\u00a0in sight.\u201d\n\nFor every hedge fund that trims its stake in the company, another seems to do the opposite. Of the 74 Wall Street analysts who cover Nvidia and are tracked by Bloomberg, 66 advise buying more of its shares; none suggests selling. Their average price target for the stock one year from now implies a market value of around $3.5trn. James Anderson, a veteran tech investor who was an early backer, teases that Nvidia could be worth $49trn in a decade, a shade more than the total value today of the\u00a0S&P\u00a0500 index of large American firms. All it would take is consistent annual sales growth of 60% at current operating margins of 60% or so, plus some plausible assumptions about cashflow. (Mr Anderson\u2019s current employer, Lingotto, is owned by Exor, the biggest shareholder of\u00a0*The Economist*\u2019s parent company.)\n\nInvestment bankers at Jefferies, Goldman Sachs and\u00a0UBS\u00a0project that Nvidia\u2019s yearly revenues will double this year, to over $100bn, grow by as much as half in 2025 and by double digits until at least 2027. By then its operating profit could exceed $150bn\u2014a third more than Apple, tech\u2019s most successful money-spinner, managed last year. The numbers are getting so big, so fast, that this alone should give the bulls pause. As they catch their breath, they might wish to ruminate on two contradictions lurking in Nvidia\u2019s long-term growth story.\n\nThe first concerns its main supplier. Nvidia\u00a0[designs chips](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/02/27/why-do-nvidias-chips-dominate-the-ai-market)\u00a0but does not produce them. That falls to\u00a0[TSMC](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/04/11/tsmcs-american-chipmaking-plans-grow-25bn-more-ambitious), a Taiwanese contract chipmaker that dominates the market for the cutting-edge silicon that goes into\u00a0AI\u00a0servers. As demand for these has rocketed, Nvidia has gone from one among many of\u00a0TSMC\u2019s clients to probably its second-biggest behind Apple. If it is indeed \u201ccustomer\u00a0B\u201d, one of two that represent at least 10% of\u00a0TSMC\u2019s revenues and must thus be disclosed in regulatory filings, it spent $7.7bn with\u00a0TSMC\u00a0last year, up from $5.5bn two years earlier. Given that most of Nvidia\u2019s purchase commitments of $19bn for 2025 are likely to end up with\u00a0TSMC, it could soon eclipse the current \u201ccustomer\u00a0A\u201d, which handed the Taiwanese firm just shy of $18bn in 2023.\n\nEven as Nvidia\u2019s and\u00a0TSMC\u2019s fates become more entwined, however, their product cycles are diverging. Earlier this year Mr Huang vowed to launch a new and improved\u00a0AI\u00a0chip every year, rather than every couple of years.\u00a0TSMC\u00a0is therefore in a mad rush to expand capacity, pledging to invest up to $32bn this year and possibly more in 2025. But it still needs at least 18 months to erect a new factory. And because these can cost $20bn a pop, careful discussions with clients typically start a year or two in advance. It is unclear how Nvidia\u2019s accelerated timeline fits in with\u00a0TSMC\u2019s more measured pace of decision-making. In an early sign of trouble, Nvidia has delayed shipments of its latest chips, called Blackwell, by a couple of months owing to technical kinks.\n\nNvidia\u2019s reliance on\u00a0TSMC\u00a0also highlights the second tension in the bulls\u2019 case. Because the manufacturer controls the volume and efficiency of production, the only way for Nvidia to ensure that it meets investors\u2019 bullish expectations for sales is to raise prices. A Blackwell chip will cost 20-25% more than the earlier generation, which was twice the price of the one before. Each chip is more powerful than the last, so the cost per unit of computing power is probably declining. But not fast enough for customers.\n\nIn August Andy Jassy, chief executive of Amazon, whose cloud-computing arm is a big user of Nvidia chips, acknowledged that he had \u201cheard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance\u201d. His company is investing in its own designs. So are Google, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla.\u00a0[AMD](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/31/could-amd-break-nvidias-chokehold-on-chips), a rival chip-designer, has gone from almost no\u00a0AI-chip sales in 2022 to a forecast $5bn this year. On August 19th it said it would buy\u00a0ZT\u00a0Systems, a server maker, helping it to compete with Nvidia\u2019s end-to-end offering. Chinese tech champions such as Huawei, barred by American sanctions from procuring top-end Nvidia gear, may forge breakthroughs that could do to Nvidia\u2019s market share what Chinese competitors like\u00a0BYD\u00a0did to Tesla\u2019s in electric cars.\n\n# Exit pursued by a bear\n\nAssuming a killer app eventually emerges\u2014which it hasn\u2019t yet\u2014generative\u00a0ai\u00a0is unlikely to become widely used unless it gets much cheaper; a ChatGPT\u00a0query can cost seven times more to answer than Google search. Nvidia may soon have to choose between lowering prices to support its growth or maintaining prices to protect its profit margin. For now Nvidia bulls think they can have it both ways. The whiff of irrational exuberance may become too overwhelming for\u00a0*U. nvidiaensis*\u00a0to resist.\u00a0\u25a0",

The rideshare giant reported record-breaking numbers in active riders and total rides, while substantially improving its financial position through increased revenue and robust cash flow generation.\n\n# STRENGTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n**Excellent revenue, EBITDA and Cash Flow growth**\u00a0\n\n* **Gross Bookings**: Reached $4.1 billion, marking a 16% year-over-year increase\n* **Revenue**: Hit $1.5 billion, showing substantial growth of 32% year-over-year\n* **Net Loss**: Posted $(12.4) million, including a $36.4 million restructuring charge\n* **Adjusted EBITDA**: Achieved $107.3 million, up from $92.0 million in Q3'23\n* **Free Cash Flow**: Generated $242.8 million, a significant improvement from $(30.0) million in Q3'23\n\n**Solid Operational Achievements**\n\nThe company set new records in its core operational metrics:\n\n* Reached 24.4 million Active Riders (9% YoY growth)\n* Delivered 217 million Rides (16% YoY growth)\n* Maintained strong driver engagement with record driver hours\n\n**Strategic Initiatives In Autonomous Vehicles**\n\nLyft announced significant partnerships in the autonomous vehicle space, positioning itself for future growth:\n\n* Formed alliances with Mobileye, May Mobility, and Nexar\n* Plans to launch autonomous vehicle service in Atlanta by 2025\n\n**Strategic Partnership with DoorDash**\n\n* Established collaboration with DoorDash, the leading U.S. local delivery platform\n* Introduced exclusive benefits for DashPass members using Lyft services\n\n# WEAKNESSES AND CHALLENGES\n\n* Secondary player to Uber (UBER) in the rideshare market, only 30% market share compared to Uber\u2019s 70%.\n* Doesn\u2019t have the secondary revenue stream of Uber Eats to absorb fixed costs\n* Smaller market share and geographic footprint\n* Limited brand recognition internationally\n* Heavy reliance on incentives to attract/retain drivers and riders\n* High customer acquisition costs\n* Competitive pressure on pricing\n\n**Wall Street seems to like it as well**\n\n\u201cWe think the strong after-hours move is deserved,\u201d Sanderson adds, and think the results will ease concern about Lyft\u2019s ability to grow profitably. \u201cBut management\u2019s 15% multi-year \\[gross bookings\\] target will still be a debate, as will the company\u2019s position for autonomous vehicles.\u201d\n\n\u201cEfficiencies are driving EBITDA ahead of expectations, and the profitability of the rides business model shined, even through increased investment into rider/demand-based incentives,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Nowak added, raising his FY25/26 adjusted EBITDA estimates by 9% and 2%, respectively, contributing to a higher price target of $18 from $16, previously.\n\nBofA Securities also lifted its price target, now at $19, as the company has \u201cseemingly limited incremental share losses, focusing on core customers and commuters that are still growing order frequency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a Buy rating on Lyft as tailwinds from mobility/transportation recovery in urban areas are outweighing risk factors like driver wage inflation, inflation\u2019s impact on consumer travel, and competition risk from Uber and new autonomous entrants,\u201d BofA\u2019s Michael McGovern and Justin Post said in their research note.\n\n**Continuing to accumulate for 3-5 years.**\n\nLyft has a long way to go, but the first and second quarter of adjusted operating profits in a row and strong cash flow generation suggest that it is a serious competitor to Uber.\n\nI had recommended and started buying Lyft in October around $13-$14, calling it an attractive GARP (Growth At A Reasonable Price), and a very reasonable valuation compared to Uber, which is unlikely to have a monopoly in the ride-sharing market.\n\nLyft deserves a seat at the table and with excellent Q3 results and raised guidance it looks even more compelling. Sure, there was a massive bump from $14 to $17. post earnings but the valuation is still attractive at 1.1x sales for 12-15% sales growth and at 17x earnings for a 15-17% grower.\n\n  \n",

        "title": "Yeti is undervalued despite tariff threats",
        "selftext": "Here's my Investment breakdown on Yeti's future and the key points applicable. Let me know what you all think\n\n**Macro Overview:**\n\n* **Macroeconomic Challenges and Tariff Risks:**\u00a0There is much uncertainty about potential tariff increases on Chinese manufacturing goods. Yeti relies on Chinese production, which could impact profit margins if increased tariffs become a reality. This situation may require Yeti to enact price increases for consumers In response, to offset costs. Yeti is actively diversifying its supply chain, aiming to reduce its dependence on China.\n* **Competitive Landscape**\u00a0Yeti operates in a fiercely competitive market. Major competitors include brands like\u00a0Stanley,\u00a0Hydro Flask,\u00a0RTIC Outdoors,\u00a0S'Well and\u00a0CamelBak. Macroeconomic conditions could intensify competition as consumers seek value-oriented options with pricing being of the utmost importance. If tariff threats become reality, costs will increase for consumers. This change will instantly impact how consumers are willing to spend.\n* **Economic Downturn and Consumer Spending:**\u00a0Yeti is heavily dependent on discretionary consumer spending.\u00a0Economic slowdowns or recessions\u00a0would reduce demand for its high-end products, like coolers and drinkware. Inflationary pressures and rising interest rates in 2025 may continue to squeeze disposable income.\n\n**Thesis:**\n\n* **Strategic Acquisitions:**\u00a0Yeti acquired two separate companies in 2024.\u00a0Mystery Ranch\u00a0is one of them. It designs and manufactures durable load-bearing backpacks, bags, and pack accessories. The acquisition was valued at approximately $36.2 million funded via cash on hand. The second company is\u00a0Butter Pat Industries, a company that specializes in premium cast iron cookware. This acquisition cost approximately $48.5 million aimed to enhance Yeti\u2019s capabilities in the cookware category. Both acquisitions helped to fuel ambitious new categories in which Yeti released new products or further enhancements in. Yeti has shown they are willing to spend cash on hand for extra growth. They can choose to do so again in the future with a large cash position over $280 million.\n* **Strong Balance Sheet and Financial Health:**\u00a0Yeti\u2019s balance sheet remains strong. There is a 10% increase in assets and a decrease in long-term debt. The company maintains a high cash-to-debt ratio of 3.55. The company\u2019s low debt load, coupled with a significant cash reserve, supports strategic opportunities. These include acquisitions and share buybacks. This financial strategy reinforces Yeti\u2019s stable financial position. It enhances the company\u2019s ability to weather economic uncertainties.\n* **DTC & Retail Growth**: Yeti has experienced significant growth in its direct-to-consumer approach. In all three quarters of 2024 Yeti has seen growth with 8.2% in Q3 alone. This expansion allows Yeti to shift strategic focus on building direct relationships with customers. It reduces reliance on third-party retailers and increases profit margins in the process. To complement this growth, Yeti is expanding their retail presence with flagship retail locations. These locations serve as experiential hubs where customers can engage with the brand.\n* **International Expansion**: International growth of over 30% indicates significant growth opportunities for the future. While it is still a small part of total sales, this growth is in many ways still in its infancy. As expansion and brand awareness continue, the international market can return a much larger share of total sales. Yeti\u2019s investments overseas have been highly rewarding. The company has seen four consecutive quarters of over 30% growth. This indicates successful market penetration and diversification\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n* The tariff concerns whether overblown or not are a real concern. Fierce competition from rivals continues to play an important factor in the battle for who has the most popular product. Yeti boasts an attractive valuation with their P/E significantly\u00a0below their 5-year average\u00a0from 36.6 to now 16.09 and a strong balance sheet. The company shows encouraging growth with enticing international expansion. This makes Yeti worth keeping an eye on at the least. Despite this, the stock has been largely flat for a year while earnings continue to outperform analyst projections. With new product offerings, Yeti showcases their strong brand reputation for premium products and further growth.\n\n\\*I do not have a position in Yeti ",

        "title": "XPEL: Analyzing Growth Potential in the Automotive Market",
        "selftext": "Here\u2019s my condensed analysis of XPEL: FYI: I focus on uncovering companies with strong growth potential and sharing my insights.\n\n**Note:** All hyperlinks will lead you to direct source material \n\n**Disclaimer:** I **DO NOT** own shares of XPEL at the time of writing\n\nI would love to hear from the community and have a in-depth conversation from ya'll. Thank you & enjoy!\n\n# Macro Overview:\n\n**Electric Vehicle Growth**\n\nThe U.S. EV market is projected to show annual growth of 10.54% from 2025-2029, resulting in a market value of $156.3 billion by 2029 [according to Statista.](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/united-states) Unit sales alone are projected to reach 2.32 million units by 2029 as well. Consumers now have significantly more choices when shopping for an electric vehicle. They can choose from offerings by [Tesla](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/), [Ford](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/), [GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM/), [Honda](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HMC/), Hyundai, and many others.\n\nEV's often have unique aesthetic and maintenance needs that typically have high-quality protective films and coatings. The growth in consumer adoption of EV's coincides with Xpel products, particularly on the impact in the aftermarket. EV owners value vehicle preservation. This creates a growing market share for XPEL'S products. These products also include heat-reducing window films that indirectly enhance battery performance.\n\n**Aging Vehicles**\n\nThe average car or truck on the road in the U.S in 2024, was more than 12.6 years old, a new record according to [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/fuel-for-thought-average-age-vehicles-2024.html#:~:text=Vehicles%20on%20the%20road%20are,by%20two%20months%20over%202023.). Consumers now choose to keep cars longer than they used to. This is largely because of the increases in new vehicle prices. As these older vehicles age, the demand for general maintenance and preservation are more-likely to rise.\n\nCar price increases have climbed for four consecutive months, according to [Kelley Blue Book data](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/after-4-straight-months-price-increases-new-car-now-costs-nearly-50000). As of December 2024, the average price of a new vehicle was $49,740, the second-highest level ever recorded. Economic uncertainty and higher costs can discourage new purchases. This situation favors repairs and maintenance of existing vehicles as the fleet continues to get older before replacement.\n\n**Technological advancements**\n\n[Self-healing films](https://www.xpel.com/products/paint-protection-film/ultimate-plus?srsltid=AfmBOopjFd4lU0Io05gEI-r8EsK9Z7gIDE7DRjI1mI7yEhQAFqPDeofN) from XPEL and competitors [3M](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MMM/), [Eastman Performance Films](https://www.eastman.com/en/who-we-are/locations/fieldale-va-usa), and [STEK Automotive](https://www.stekautomotive.com/) were released much earlier. They have recently gained traction as consumers want paint protection film to protect their vehicles. Self-healing films use polymer capable of automatically repairing minor scratches and abrasions when exposed to heat. As vehicles on the road become increasingly older, the demand for reduced effort in maintaining a vehicle's exterior will increase. Vehicle owners will likely seek easier maintenance solutions with minimal effort that repel against water, dirt, and scratches more easily. Consumers and manufacturers are increasingly adopting self-healing films. People who want to protect their older vehicles find XPEL appealing. It is also chosen to keep luxury cars in pristine condition.\n\n# Investment Thesis:\n\nXPEL is a compelling investment with an attractive growth story in the automotive sector. It is supported by a strong brand presence, international expansion growth, and financial strength. With high expectations, investors should take notice in the premium valuation risks apparent. Long-term growth is certainly compelling but there are clear short-term headwinds including macroeconomic uncertainties that require careful monitoring.\n\n* **Product Diversification:** XPEL is widely known for their paint protection films. These films contribute to 70% of total Q3 sales and grew by 2.7%. Still, products like their window film and ceramic coatings have outperformed with growth of 20.6%. [Non-automotive products](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_presentations/2024/11/Q3-2024-XPEL-Investor-Presentation.pdf) like home & office window films, antimicrobial film, and niche surface protection film also out-performed by 11.6%. Together, both segments contributed 30% to total sales. Impressive growth outperformance though has largely been a significant reason for overall revenue growth in recent quarters.\n* **International Expansion:** U.S. sales are the largest contributor to total revenue, accounting for 57.2% of the total and reaching $64.6 million in Q3, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9.4%. Despite the reliance on U.S. sales, International sales continue to outperform. Canada is the second largest contributor at 12.8% of revenue with growth of 25.7% to $14.4 million. All international markets saw growth except for the third largest market which is China. China saw a significant decline of -11.6% to just $9.06 million. The decrease was primarily attributed to XPEL's distributor working through excess inventory levels. With only a weighting of 8% of total sales, the negative growth did not hurt overall sales significantly. While XPEL faced challenges in China as well as minor growth of 4.1% and 1.4% in Europe and the U.K, strong international performance lead to record revenue.\n* **Strategic Partnerships:** XPEL has established multiple strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. Recent collaborations with brands like [Tesla](https://lp.xpel.com/tesla-window-film), [Kia](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), exclusive [Rivian](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_news/XPEL-and-Rivian-Expand-Collaboration-With-New-PPF-and-Window-Film-Program-2024.pdf) supplier partnership, [BMW](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), and [Team Penske](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2024/07/10/xpel-partners-with-team-penske-to-protect-indycars-and-drivers/) have been formed. These collaborations, including with service providers like [Tint World](https://www.tintworld.com/news-media/news-and-press/industry-leaders-tint-world-and-xpel-announce-partnership/), have strengthened market presence. Brand visibility and revenue growth have also increased as a result. The Tesla partnership in particular is of major importance due to their dominance in the EV market. These recent collaborations integrate XPEL's wide array of products into solutions for high-profile vehicles and events. The partnerships with Tesla and Rivian are particularly significant. They expand their reach into the electric vehicle market that continues to rapidly grow in the U.S. and internationally.\n\n# Risk Factors:\n\n* **Reliance On Chinese Distribution:** [Potential tariff threats to China](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-importers-rush-goods-china-trump-tariff-threat-looms-2025-01-15/) from a new administration will significantly impact XPEL if enacted. If new tariffs are applied, XPEL will be faced with increases in far materials leading to higher production costs. With the U.S market as the largest source of revenue at 57.2%, passing on further costs to consumers would likely reduce demand. Most importantly, reliance on one distributor could lead to supply chain constraints due to an over-reliance on one company. Price increases or delayed deliveries would harm relationships and hurt XPEL's brand.\n* **The Culper Research Short Report:** On October 19, 2023, [Culper Research issued a short report](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/cc91fda7-4669-4d1b-81ce-a0b8d77f25ab/downloads/Culper_XPEL_10-19-2023.pdf?ver=1733419998410) sending XPEL's stock retreating -17.3% from $51.51 per share to $42.61. A notable accusation was XPEL's understated reliance on Tesla. [XPEL responded](https://ppfmag.com/short-seller-targets-xpel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) by stating Tesla represented just 5% of 2023 revenue. Secondly, Culper believes XPEL is concealing a massive risk. Their primary supplier, \"Entrotech, Inc\", has formed a [joint venture with PPG Industries](https://news.ppg.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/PPG-launches-paint-films-solutions-for-automotive-and-industrial-customers/default.aspx) on May 23, 2023. Lastly, Culper's claim as seen below, would have massive repercussions for XPEL if they are correct.\n* **Additional Culper Info:** The validity of Culper's claims on XPEL and others have been [called into question many times](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/827876/000166357721000030/ex99_1.htm) for self-benefiting public statements. What we do know for sure is the joint venture with PPG Industries is in fact truthful. The extent of which XPEL will become obsolete on the other is a highly questionable take. For some reason, Culper did not mention that XPEL stands out due to their DAP software. It is not because of the PPF raw material. Hence, XPEL would know exactly how much material and company their products were installed on. These allegations were made in 2023. XPEL has continued to show strong growth. The company has not skipped a beat.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nXPEL offers an attractive growth story in the automotive industry. This growth is supported by their strong market position and international expansion. The company also has a diverse product portfolio and strategic partnerships. A P/E ratio of 23.98 certainly wouldn't be viewed as cheap by any measures. Still, their P/E is significantly below their five-year average P/E of 41.6. Long-term growth remains compelling with the expectation of double-digit growth in the next two years.\n\nNonetheless, there are near-term headwinds. Sure, XPEL has displayed a history of growth, but near-term macroeconomic uncertainties regarding tariff concerns are worth monitoring. XPEL must consider how to react to such challenges since their distributor is based in China. For the reasons noted above, we still believe XPEL is a compelling BUY. It offers long-term sustainable growth, strategic partnerships, international expansion, and a strong balance sheet.",

My point was that with the average car age on the road being 12.6 years, consumers have been taking more steps in preserving their vehicles due to the increased costs in replacing it. PPF is not just for your entire car which can be expensive. I have two friends that have older sports cars, one went with 3M and the other with XPEL as they were tired of having bumps and scratches on their cars. They were much more inclined to have PPF installed as they have zero interest in trading them in",

        "selftext": "Riding the MSFT Rocket \ud83d\ude80\u00a0\n\nAlright, here\u2019s 2 cents on MSFT\u00a0\n\n**Current Play**\u00a0\n\nMSFT is hanging out at $427.87, flirting just below its recent peak of $433.60. The 50-day moving average is chillin' at $414.55, while the 200-day is holding down at $395.67. Volume\u2019s spiking, and you know what that means someone's loading up heavy!\u00a0\n\n**Analyst Chatter**\u00a0\n\n**Analysts are bullish on Microsoft:**\u00a0\n\n* Goldman Sachs reaffirmed their \u201cbuy\u201d rating with a target of $460.\u00a0\n* Morgan Stanley is rating it \u201coverweight,\u201d targeting $450.\u00a0\n* JP Morgan set a $455 target, taking a neutral stance.\u00a0\n* Barclays raised their target to $470, maintaining a \u201cbuy.\u201d\u00a0\n* Credit Suisse is holding steady with a $445 target.\u00a0\n\nOverall, 30 out of 35 analysts recommend a \u201cbuy,\u201d with an average target around $460. The general sentiment is bullish, focusing on Microsoft\u2019s advancements in AI and cloud computing.\u00a0\n\n**Financial Pulse**\u00a0\n\n**Microsoft\u2019s financials are rock solid:**\u00a0\n\n* Earnings Per Share came in at $11.01, beating expectations.\u00a0\n* Revenue: $56.2 billion, up 11.3% year-over-year. Big boy numbers.\u00a0\n\n**Key ratios to note:**\u00a0\n\n* Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.40.\u00a0\n* Profit Margin: 33%.\u00a0\n* Return on Equity: 35%.\u00a0\n\nThese figures highlight Microsoft\u2019s robust growth and profitability.\u00a0\n\n**Insider Moves**\u00a0\n\n**There\u2019s been some notable insider trading:**\u00a0\n\n* Satya Nadella, CEO, sold 59,907 shares in May, likely cashing in on gains.\u00a0\n* Amy Hood, CFO, sold 20,000 shares. Total insider sales have reached about $40 million in the past quarter.\u00a0\n\nDespite these sales, insiders still hold significant shares, signaling continued confidence.\u00a0\n\nInstitutional Maneuvers\u00a0\n\n**Big institutional players are bullish:**\u00a0\n\n* BlackRock added 1.2 million shares.\u00a0\n* Vanguard Group increased their stake significantly.\u00a0\n* Renaissance Technologies boosted their position by 5%.\u00a0\n* T. Rowe Price now holds $6.5 billion worth of MSFT shares.\u00a0\n\nThese moves show strong institutional confidence in Microsoft\u2019s future.\u00a0\n\n**Major News and Tech Developments**\u00a0\n\n**Several key developments are pushing Microsoft forward:**\u00a0\n\n**AI and Cloud Expansion:** Microsoft is aggressively expanding its AI and cloud capabilities. They\u2019ve introduced Copilot, an AI-driven tool within Microsoft 365, which automates routine tasks and provides advanced analytics. This tool is expected to enhance user productivity significantly.\u00a0\n\n**OpenAI Partnership**: Their deepening partnership with OpenAI is a major catalyst. Integrating advanced AI models from OpenAI into Azure positions Microsoft as a leader in AI-as-a-service. They\u2019ve also launched ChatGPT Enterprise, offering secure and scalable AI solutions for businesses.\u00a0\n\n**Quantum Computing:** Microsoft\u2019s investment in quantum computing through Azure Quantum is promising. This technology is expected to tackle complex problems more efficiently than classical computing, potentially revolutionizing fields like logistics, cryptography, and pharmaceuticals.\u00a0\n\n**AI Hardware Advances:** Microsoft is working on a custom AI chip, Athena, to enhance AI applications\u2019 performance across their cloud infrastructure. This should reduce reliance on third-party chips and lower costs.\u00a0\n\n**Cloud Services Growth:** Azure\u2019s growth continues, driven by new enterprise customers and expanded services in data analytics and cybersecurity. Microsoft\u2019s cloud services are pivotal for the digital transformation of businesses worldwide.\u00a0\n\n# Apple\u2019s Flop\n\nApple just had an epic fail, folks. Their AI event was a total disaster, and it\u2019s got people rethinking their game plan. Here\u2019s the tea:\n\n* **Lackluster AI Unveil:** Apple tried to flex their new AI features, but it was a major letdown. They barely brought anything new to the table. The crowd reaction was like, \u201cSeriously, Apple? That\u2019s it?\u201d\n* **Tech Flops:** The live demo was a nightmare. Siri couldn\u2019t handle basic commands without lagging or outright failing. Imagine trying to show off your new tech, and it glitches right in front of everyone. Cringe city.\n* **Market Reaction:** Investors weren\u2019t having it. Apple\u2019s stock took a 3% dive today as people dumped shares faster than you can say \u201cAI fail.\u201d Wall Street\u2019s questioning whether Apple can even hang in the AI race now.\n* **Missed Opportunities:** Apple didn\u2019t announce any major AI collaborations or breakthroughs, leaving the impression that they\u2019re playing catch-up instead of leading the charge.\n* **Consumer Backlash:** Social media is roasting Apple\u2019s presentation, with memes and complaints about how underwhelming it was. Not the kind of viral you want.\n\nLooks like Microsoft is poised to steal the AI crown while Apple scrambles to get their act together. With MSFT\u2019s solid AI strategy and Apple tripping over their own feet, this is a prime time to bet on Microsoft pulling ahead.\n\n**My Strategy**\u00a0\n\n**Technical Setup:**\u00a0\n\n* 50-Day Moving Average: $414.55.\u00a0\n* 200-Day Moving Average: $395.67.\u00a0\n\n**Entry Points:**\u00a0\n\n* Short-Term: I\u2019m looking to enter around $420.00, which aligns with support and offers a solid risk/reward ratio.\u00a0\n* Long-Term: If it drops to the 50-day MA at $414.55 or below, it\u2019s a strong buy for long-term holding.\u00a0\n\n**Exit Strategy:**\u00a0\n\n* Short-Term Gains: I\u2019m targeting an exit around $460.00, in line with average analyst targets.\u00a0\n* Long-Term Hold: I\u2019m aiming for a higher exit around $470.00, which aligns with Barclays\u2019 more bullish target.\u00a0\n\n**Risk Management:**\u00a0\n\n* Monitor Financial News: I\u2019ll keep an eye on AI and cloud computing updates and any new tech releases.\u00a0\n* Adjust Stops: I\u2019ll raise the stop-loss level as the stock price rises to protect gains.\u00a0\n\n**The Bottom Line**\u00a0\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s push into AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing, combined with strategic partnerships and new tech developments, positions it well for growth. With entry points around $420.00 and exit targets between $460.00 and $470.00, MSFT looks set for solid gains. I\u2019ll stay updated on financial and tech news to maximize the potential from this trade.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s to making smart moves! \ud83e\udd42\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",
