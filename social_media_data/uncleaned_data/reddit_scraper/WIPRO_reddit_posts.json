        "selftext": "India has historically trailed the US and China when it comes to AI investment \u2014 just $21.8bn over the past decade compared to $455bn in the US and $92.7bn in China. But the government\u2019s new $1.2bn IndiaAI strategy suggests that's starting to change, with the plan including building a domestic LLM and making 10,000 GPUs available to startups and researchers.\n\nWe've explored some of the top IT companies: Infosys is working on 400+ AI projects, TCS just crossed $30bn in annual revenue, partly thanks to AI-led deals. Wipro says AI is now central to almost every client conversation, and it's locked in over $5bn in large deals this year.\n\nDo you think this shift is enough to create a real tailwind for Indian IT over the next few years?",

        "selftext": "Investing in large-cap companies like Reliance, Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and ITC may not yield multibagger returns. For significant gains, consider small-cap, micro-cap, and select mid-cap stocks. Let\u2019s explore why and how these investments can be more rewarding.\n\nHow Does a Stock Become a Multibagger?\nLow Price and Low Market Capitalization (Mcap):\nA stock is low-priced when it has a low Mcap, often due to existing negatives or concerns in the market.\nMarket participants tend to overlook these stocks because of these perceived negatives, keeping their prices low.\nThe Investment Strategy\nIdentifying Potential Multibaggers:\n\nAs investors seeking multibagger returns, our goal is to identify and invest in stocks that the market is not currently favoring.\nOnce the negative aspects are resolved, the stock\u2019s value can significantly increase.\nExample:\n\nConsider a small-cap stock in the pharmaceutical sector, such as Laurus Labs. Initially, it may have faced issues with regulatory approvals, keeping its price low. Once these hurdles were overcome, the stock saw substantial growth, becoming a multibagger.\nThe Common Misconception\nExpecting Perfect Fundamentals at Low Prices:\n\nIt is unrealistic to find a stock priced at 20 with perfect fundamentals. Such stocks will naturally have some negatives.\nLarge-cap stocks with a Mcap of 10,000 crores or more have often already delivered significant returns. Expecting them to become multibaggers from this point is impractical.\nExample:\n\nInfosys, a leading IT company, has a high Mcap and has already provided substantial returns over the years. Expecting it to continue delivering multibagger returns is unrealistic.\nThe Potential of Smaller Mcap Stocks\nSmaller Mcap Stocks Have Higher Growth Potential:\n\nStocks with a Mcap of 200 crores can grow to 2,000 crores, providing a tenfold return.\nSimilarly, a stock with a Mcap of 500 crores can grow to 5,000 crores, offering significant returns.\nExample:\n\nConsider a company like Avanti Feeds, which had a lower Mcap but expanded its business significantly, leading to multibagger returns.\nUnderstanding Market Saturation\nSaturation Point and Valuation:\n\nAfter a certain Mcap, a stock\u2019s growth potential diminishes, making it harder to achieve multibagger status.\nStocks with Mcaps above 10,000 crores require extraordinary growth to become multibaggers, which is challenging.\nExample:\n\nTata Motors, with a high Mcap, would need exceptional growth in sales and profitability to double or triple its value, which is less likely compared to smaller companies.\nSimple Rules for Stock Market Success\nBuy Less Discussed Stocks:\n\nInvesting in under-the-radar stocks can yield high returns as they are often undervalued.\nBuy Underowned Stocks:\n\nStocks with low institutional ownership may have greater growth potential once discovered.\nLook for Multibagger Prospects:\n\nFocus on companies with the potential for significant growth rather than those that have already delivered high returns.\nAvoid Stocks That Are Already Multibaggers:\n\nStocks that have already provided substantial returns may have limited future growth.\nConsider Mcap:\n\nAlways evaluate the Mcap to understand the potential for future growth. Stocks with lower Mcaps generally have higher growth potential.\nBy following these guidelines and focusing on small-cap, micro-cap, and promising mid-cap stocks, investors can build a portfolio with the potential for multibagger returns. Remember, the key lies in identifying undervalued opportunities and being patient as these stocks realize their growth potential.",

And I am looking to invest some more in the IT companies.\n\nI went ahead and checked PE and P/B ratios of few major IT players in India - TCS, LTI, Happiest Minds, HCL, Mphasis, Persistent, TechM\n\nInterestingly, Wipro has considerably less PE(26.52) and P/B(3.94) ratios as compared to the companies quotes above.\n\nSo, Is Wipro a good buy and what is the reason for low valuation?",

There are many other better IT stocks out there in cheap valuation, and when the IT sector moves up Wipro will be left behind. This is my analysis, it is the best time to accumulate IT stocks.

However i entered market in September as an equity investor, started with 12L worth of stocks, they  reached 9L, took loss and finally today booked final loss of 90K.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2ac8m4i8mle1.png?width=2574&format=png&auto=webp&s=9baf9a640657e3cb7ee1d9cc63f6a62427b27876\n\nand these are my futures positions as of 10:46 AM today:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlcg6zgw8mle1.jpg?width=1023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4abd4aa2fb2c6ba928b7a3a74c5f9bfa9531f70\n\n  \nPoint being:\n\nPeople who are asking you to hold, think about it. The fall of market from September till now and in order to make some profits (if you invested after September, 2024) you first need to get NIFTY up at September levels to break even and then further up to make some profit.\n\nNow i only hold 1 Gold ETF and the way I see the market, its going to bleed. As a short seller even 1 day of bleed is a day of immense returns.\n\nThere are many new investors sitting on huge loses with confused mind. My POV is, if you need money, take loss, if you can learn shorting then take loss and short however if that is your 'non active' money which you don't care for then let it be there however I don't think should listen to people who use the word 'average it', average of - is the -.\n\nAnother point of making this post is, to keep my action today on records permanently so 1 year from now I can look back and conclude on this decision.\n\nMoney freed from above stock sales is reinvested as 'shorting' in VOLTAS MAR FUT and HERO MOTOCOP MAR FUT (up by 4k at this moment)\n\nThanks for reading.

You can buy 4 shares and assuming the bank goes god mode and produces 100% returns a year for 3 years which isn't gonna happen the stock would then be trading at 7.6k per share. So your 9k becomes 30k. In 3 years. You can earn that money through internships over your college years with the right skill in whatever field you choose. \n\n\nIn a more realistic scenario. Let's say you buy 1 stock at 1.9k. The stock falls to 1.7k. You buy another share. The stock drops to 1.5k. You buy 2 more. Now you're out of capital to average down and you're at the mercy of the market. Overtime the stock will go up but you're not gonna double your money in 3 years.\n\n\nYou can solve this liquidity issue by having more capital. You can have more capital if you make good money. To make good money you need a high paying job. To get a high paying job you need to up your skill. You can buy far more quantity and consistently plan to average down every month after payday if you have a job that pays well. \n\n\nOh and I almost forgot. When you finally make that profit you'll be paying 12.5% of that profit to the government as tax after the brokerages, security tax, gst etc. So keep tabs on the market learn a thing or two from it but try to build or improve your skill in whatever field.",

Even the recently shining PSU bank stocks like SBI, PNB, etc even after posting amazing quarterly results with least historic NPAs, the fund is not interested in buying fresh quantities rather quitting them aggressively.

That's why start SIP regardless of where market is. If it goes down you buy more. Take profits in what the INDEX gives hence you're buying NIFTY 500 or NIFTY 250 broad market fund so you buy little of all companies. Debt fund helps hedge against stock market uncertainty/depression and so does gold fund.\n\nConsistently, top university research has shown broad market instruments like ETF, MF that follow index REGULARLY beat fund managers or individual stocks.

        "selftext": "# \n\nHey r/IndianStockMarket, let's talk about why AI could be bad news for Indian IT stocks like TCS, Wipro, and Infosys.\n\n# A Story from the Past: BlackBerry\n\nRemember BlackBerry phones? In 2007, they were huge. The iPhone had just come out, but BlackBerry was still doing great. Their stock price was going up.\n\n[BlackBerry Share Price picked in 2017\\(at time of Iphone launch\\)](https://preview.redd.it/v863wurei3ed1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=225c092b60a145b99e4c52143b9c558ff22eacc3)\n\nBut a few years later, BlackBerry was in trouble. The iPhone and Android phones took over.\n\n[USA Market Share of RIM vs Android vs iPhone](https://preview.redd.it/kddcesfii3ed1.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=de7423046cd1f0c0ad2fdb239ed1911779dc2077)\n\nThe lesson? Big changes in tech don't always happen right away. They start slow, then suddenly everything changes.\n\n# AI is Coming for IT Jobs\n\nI think something similar is happening now with AI in the IT world. Right now, IT stocks look good. Companies are hiring, and things seem great.\n\nBut AI is getting really good at doing IT work. Imagine this:\n\n1. A company tells an AI what they want their software to do.\n2. The AI writes the code and tests it.\n3. Humans just check the AI's work and make small changes.\n\nThis could mean less work for IT companies.\n\n# Why This is Bad for Indian IT Stocks\n\nCompanies like TCS, Wipro, and Infosys make money by providing lots of IT workers. But what if clients don't need as many workers because of AI?\n\n1. Clients might hire fewer people from these companies.\n2. These companies might have to lower their prices to compete with AI.\n3. It's hard for big companies to change how they work quickly.\n\n# What to Watch For\n\n1. Look at how fast companies start using AI for their IT work.\n2. Check if IT companies are hiring less or letting people go.\n3. See if these companies are making less money per worker.\n\n# What This Means for Investors\n\nThe change won't happen overnight. But when it does, it could be big.\n\nYou don't need to sell all your IT stocks right away. But it might be smart to start investing in other types of companies too.\n\nWhat do you think? Is AI a real threat to Indian IT stocks?\n\n*Remember: This isn't financial advice. Always research before making investment decisions.*",

                "body": "As someone working day-in-day-out with GenAI, it's not replacing anything or anyone.\n\nIt is, however, changing the way companies contract work significantly.\n\n\nEdit: \n\nBefore you read the rest of it, I want to say, I'm excited about AI but in a positive manner. It's going to change the kind of problems we solve and the complexity and nature of it. It's a great space to be in.\n\n\nSince I see a lot of people raising similar points in my replies.\n\n- Can it replace things?\n\nYes. \n\n- Will it? \n\nTo some extent yes, but it's not nearly as catastrophic as some people are assuming.\n\n- Will it cause layoffs?\n\nWe saw a whole wave of layoffs irrespective of the advancements in GenAI. The only significant thing it impacts in the short-term is companies' abilities to build long-term contracts; clients are more tech-aware in the 2020s and everyone's looking for efficiencies on the \"$ spend-to-people employed\" ratio. \n\nLess with more - that's going to be the game for the rest of this decade. So more than layoffs, we will see \"slowdowns\" in hiring but that too in small phases at best.\n\n- What about AGI?\n\nAGI, while it may happen, is not going to get adopted so easily. Replacing humans in the context and scale of what GenAI is attempting to do will be met with a lot of resistance from a policy and regulatory pov.\nWe're already seeing this in some instances, there are a few individuals and companies that are either taking their content offline or are aiming to bring in a new path of licensing that prohibits AI companies from training their models on said data.\n\n- A factor that people are not taking as seriously as they should. Cost.\n\nAI companies are eating a lot of cost right now. And while it's safe to assume that \"technology advancements\" over the next 8-10 years will bring down this cost automatically, it's still an assumption.\n\n- Growth Curve\n\nAI has sort of plateau-ed (for the lack of a better word), the growth path hasn't been an exponential curve as we saw when it went from gpt-3 to 3.5 to 4.\n\n- Will it replace service based companies?\n\nYes and no.\n\nFor the \"yes\" part of the answer - it's goign to make lives easy for people, a lot of the trivial work you do is going to get delegated to AI, now if that was the only thing you did as a job then sure you'll get replaced.\n\nThe \"no\" part of the answer - context is tough. Codegen and GenAI tend to process problems in a stateless manner and often lack the broader context of what you're trying to do. While the demos for these tools look great, the reality is often not as rosy.\n\nMoreover, natural language is flawed as an input mechanism so make of that what you will.\n\n- How do I figure what's going on with AI?\n\nTry to judge AI as a solitary entity. \n\nIf you hear about AI greatness from people who work in AI and people who are bound to _gain_ from AI - Altman, Nadella, or any investor for that matter - then that's a biased POV.\n\nWe saw Devin getting launched but the hype around it is well and truly dead until they come with v2.0\n\nSame with RabbitOS - turns out, it's android and selenium under-the-hood.\n\nListen to podcasts but don't form an opinion based on it.",

But that's very different from the work these tech companies do. \n\nNote - I am bullish on the Technology. But AI as we have in 2024, is still far from replacing coders.

As it was in peak, more people enrolled in same domain and created a higher supply than demand. Hence salaries got saturated and number of vacancies as well. With time even internal flows got automated for tech portings. \n\nSame pattern i am observing in IT. On top of that now AI will make engineer more efficient hence less engineers per projects. Just take an example of twitter, elon managed with less number of engineers. And this is without any AI. \n\nIf this happen, many other sectors might be affected as i think indian growth could stagnant (If india do not pick on manufacturing quickly)",

Don\u2019t just jump in for quick gains or name driven investment sort of things.\n\nIf you're serious about returns, look into large-cap stocks or rising companies with solid fundamentals\u2014like consistent profit growth, low or no debt, no promoter pledging, etc. Use tools like Screener.in for basic fundamental analysis and latest news.\n\nA good starting point is comparing the P/E ratio with peer companies in the same sector (Open the stock on screener you will see below all peer with basic numbers, each to make a choice). If it\u2019s significantly lower than industry median, the stock might be undervalued (but always dig deeper\u2014don\u2019t rely on just one metric).\n\nKeep an eye on market sentiment and try to buy on dips if you believe in the company\u2019s long-term potential. Timing + conviction matters. See people were happy buying tata moters on 1000\u20b9 but nobody like to buy it on \u20b9600 now..\n\nIf you're new to all this, I'd highly recommend the Zerodha Varsity app to understand market basics\u2014it\u2019s free and beginner-friendly.\n\nAlso, consider starting with index mutual funds or ETFs if you\u2019re not ready to pick individual stocks yet. Way less stress, and you still get market exposure. (Example- Icici next50 ETF)\n\nAnd yeah\u2014don\u2019t forget about charges and taxes. Every trade has brokerage, STT, and capital gains tax (15% short-term, 10% long-term over \u20b91L).\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to learn, but start slow, stay consistent, and don\u2019t invest based on hype. \ud83d\ude4c",

        "selftext": "Finally made my first 5 digit profit, been trading small quantities for over 1.5 years alongside my freelancing job\n\nNot a new trader, been trading for over 2 years now but was trading with 50k-1L capital and used to withdraw my profits from time to time. Always traded options for swings(max total value never more than 8-10k) and max 2 good swing setups a week. Everything else intraday, risk no more than 700-800 rs per trade and target 1:2/1:3. Intraday I mostly trade as per the trending sectors, and then selecting the stocks which have moved less compared to the other stocks and enter those.\n\nCapital used for today\u2019s trades is approx 1.2L, was planning not to deploy more than 1L but market was trending so deployed slightly more.\n\nHave been reading a lot of posts here everyday which describe how it\u2019s almost impossible to make money trading. Just want to let everybody know, that it\u2019s not impossible, but the learning curve is VERY steep. And by the time most people reach the end of this curve, they\u2019ve blown up multiple accounts, and also end up destroying the other MOST important thing, which is their mindset.\n\nSo please remember, always start small. Take more swings and wait patiently for your setups to form. Risk very little in intraday as market doesn\u2019t trend everyday, atleast not all the sectors. Some will trend daily but you need to get the flow right, which again takes a lot of time. Risking and making less intraday is crucial, which lets you ride your swings fully. 5-6 days like today and I can make a 6 figure income, which I\u2019d say at my level is extremely good\n\nAnd also, having a source of income alongside trading gives you a peace of mind. Not forcing you to take the substandard setups/trades. \n\nIf you be disciplined, less greedy and fully focused on what you do, the money eventually comes. Stop focusing on daily/weekly results and be fully in sync with the process. There is indeed light at the end of this tunnel, provided you don\u2019t stray from the correct path :) ",

Zaggle has over aggressive revenue recognition policies and also seems to be capitalising costs. \n2. The nature of business of Zaggle is confusing. Is it a SaaS business or merely a middleman that sells prepaid cards and profits from its transactions?\n3. Esop policies prior to the IPO doesn't inspire confidence.\n\nAll these are the reasons why I am bearish on Zaggle. Ofc I maybe totally wrong.",

Thanks to VCs. So you can't make such gains. But its possible that many stocks will erode money.\n\nMutual funds are best to invest, not stocks. If you think you are more intelligent than worlds top minds - the fund managers then you can invest.\n\nNow sectorial mutual fund also exist. Nifty only fallen 10%-15% why people crying because they think they are more intelligent than top stock market analyst and invested in stock. In india, any stock can disappear anytime. Ask people invested in satyam, Unitech. That were part of Nifty. One scam and it disappeared. Thousands of such companies are de listed on stock market.
