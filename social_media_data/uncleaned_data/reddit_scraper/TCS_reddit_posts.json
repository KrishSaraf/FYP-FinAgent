And I just analyzed 4 pop giants and here is what i just found out from simple scan of QoQ result.\n\nThe Trend is Immensely helpful over the numbers. Beacuse using tht you can discriminate the ***nature of business of the stock***.  \n\n* **TCS** - Consistent business without much of seasonality or cyclicality\n* **Dmart** - Consistent business with some seasonality. Has to run its business at very low margin\n* **HAL** - Much of seasonality & and may be little cyclicality in business. JFM Quarter is good !\n* **VBL** -   Much of seasonality in business. AMJ Quarter is good !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vkvh75uoljd1.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=0033a0dacc316e3ac254a87680cb37d61f0ca4df",

But the government\u2019s new $1.2bn IndiaAI strategy suggests that's starting to change, with the plan including building a domestic LLM and making 10,000 GPUs available to startups and researchers.\n\nWe've explored some of the top IT companies: Infosys is working on 400+ AI projects, TCS just crossed $30bn in annual revenue, partly thanks to AI-led deals. Wipro says AI is now central to almost every client conversation, and it's locked in over $5bn in large deals this year.\n\nDo you think this shift is enough to create a real tailwind for Indian IT over the next few years?",

        "selftext": "Investing in large-cap companies like Reliance, Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and ITC may not yield multibagger returns. For significant gains, consider small-cap, micro-cap, and select mid-cap stocks. Let\u2019s explore why and how these investments can be more rewarding.\n\nHow Does a Stock Become a Multibagger?\nLow Price and Low Market Capitalization (Mcap):\nA stock is low-priced when it has a low Mcap, often due to existing negatives or concerns in the market.\nMarket participants tend to overlook these stocks because of these perceived negatives, keeping their prices low.\nThe Investment Strategy\nIdentifying Potential Multibaggers:\n\nAs investors seeking multibagger returns, our goal is to identify and invest in stocks that the market is not currently favoring.\nOnce the negative aspects are resolved, the stock\u2019s value can significantly increase.\nExample:\n\nConsider a small-cap stock in the pharmaceutical sector, such as Laurus Labs. Initially, it may have faced issues with regulatory approvals, keeping its price low. Once these hurdles were overcome, the stock saw substantial growth, becoming a multibagger.\nThe Common Misconception\nExpecting Perfect Fundamentals at Low Prices:\n\nIt is unrealistic to find a stock priced at 20 with perfect fundamentals. Such stocks will naturally have some negatives.\nLarge-cap stocks with a Mcap of 10,000 crores or more have often already delivered significant returns. Expecting them to become multibaggers from this point is impractical.\nExample:\n\nInfosys, a leading IT company, has a high Mcap and has already provided substantial returns over the years. Expecting it to continue delivering multibagger returns is unrealistic.\nThe Potential of Smaller Mcap Stocks\nSmaller Mcap Stocks Have Higher Growth Potential:\n\nStocks with a Mcap of 200 crores can grow to 2,000 crores, providing a tenfold return.\nSimilarly, a stock with a Mcap of 500 crores can grow to 5,000 crores, offering significant returns.\nExample:\n\nConsider a company like Avanti Feeds, which had a lower Mcap but expanded its business significantly, leading to multibagger returns.\nUnderstanding Market Saturation\nSaturation Point and Valuation:\n\nAfter a certain Mcap, a stock\u2019s growth potential diminishes, making it harder to achieve multibagger status.\nStocks with Mcaps above 10,000 crores require extraordinary growth to become multibaggers, which is challenging.\nExample:\n\nTata Motors, with a high Mcap, would need exceptional growth in sales and profitability to double or triple its value, which is less likely compared to smaller companies.\nSimple Rules for Stock Market Success\nBuy Less Discussed Stocks:\n\nInvesting in under-the-radar stocks can yield high returns as they are often undervalued.\nBuy Underowned Stocks:\n\nStocks with low institutional ownership may have greater growth potential once discovered.\nLook for Multibagger Prospects:\n\nFocus on companies with the potential for significant growth rather than those that have already delivered high returns.\nAvoid Stocks That Are Already Multibaggers:\n\nStocks that have already provided substantial returns may have limited future growth.\nConsider Mcap:\n\nAlways evaluate the Mcap to understand the potential for future growth. Stocks with lower Mcaps generally have higher growth potential.\nBy following these guidelines and focusing on small-cap, micro-cap, and promising mid-cap stocks, investors can build a portfolio with the potential for multibagger returns. Remember, the key lies in identifying undervalued opportunities and being patient as these stocks realize their growth potential.",

Persistent Systems also faced substantial losses, with its stock dropping around 6%. This sell-off was largely influenced by global market trends, particularly the disappointing earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia, which triggered a ripple effect across international markets, including India.\n\nThe broader market sentiment was also negative, with the Sensex falling over 1,000 points and the Nifty dropping below the 22,300 mark. This broad-based sell-off affected multiple sectors, including auto, metals, and banking. Factors contributing to the decline include global economic uncertainty, profit booking across markets, and the impact of Nvidia's earnings report. Despite these challenges, the IT sector remains a crucial component of India's economy, though ongoing global uncertainties pose significant risks.",

So you can allocate on your own through your own account and family account or just invest 7 this year and after march you can invest more to save on TCS. \n\nI have been investing in US/ europe/ china/ Taiwan and i use that same strategy of having my own account and my family accounts. To avoid TCS and reduce tax liability on my returns. \n\nEtf is not the best way to invest globally because the underlining assets are traded on a daily basis and huge transaction cost happens which is not reflected by ETF.( read terry smith investing for growth and he has dedicated 2 chapters on etf and how these managers burn our money and on face of it you will see that the fee is low but transaction fees are hidden and not shown) that erodes 2-3% of your capital yearly just as transaction fees and if you compound that for 10 years its around 50% of your money which you could have made by just buying directly  and performing better than etf.",

        "selftext": "I moved to Pune in 2018 and lived near the Persistent System office. I used to pass through their building, and It may sound funny but one of the reasons to check the company was because I liked their office names. I started investing in the PPFAS mutual fund and the persistent system was one of the top holdings. I bought shares worth 45K in 2018. Sold 1/3rd in 2021 and again in 2022 to get advantage of 1 lakh LTCG tax-expectation. Also bought TATA elixir during the same period and sold it when it became 2X.\n\nI did make some money but after seeing the further growth I promised myself that I would never sell  \nunless there is something seriously wrong with the companies I am holding. Have not sold a single stock since March 2022, Remaining 15k of the persistent system is now 2.60 lakhs (17X) in 6 years. I have HDFC Bank, ITC, Persistent System, Arman Finance, Maruti, Titan, ICICI Bank, TCS, and NMDC in my portfolio.\n\nI know my XIRR (22%) may not be impressive in today\u2019s scenario but I would suggest don\u2019t sell your  \nwinner for a small gain. If you are holding good companies, there is potential it could be 25X or 50X in the long term. Also, think what difference it will make to your wealth if u even make 5k in 6 months on a 10k investment. It will surely make a difference if u make 2.5 lakh from 10k. \u00a0\n\nEdit: Corrected Typo of the year of sell.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm pretty new to trading and usually invest in large-cap stocks but in small amounts. Recently, I wanted to learn about shorting stocks. For those who don't know, it's when you sell a stock at a high price and then buy it back at a lower price, and your profit is the difference.\n\nSo, some days ago, I decided to short 1 share of TCS and ended up making a profit of \u20b95. I was excited until I saw the Equity Contract Note from Zerodha the next day. I couldn\u2019t believe the number of charges on such a small profit.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n* **Pay in/Pay out obligation:** \u20b95.00\n* **Taxable value of Supply (Brokerage):** \u20b9(2.58)\n* **Exchange transaction charges:** \u20b9(0.29)\n* **Clearing charges:** N/A\n* **CGST (@9% of Brok, SEBI, Trans & Clearing Charges):** N/A\n* **SGST (@9% of Brok, SEBI, Trans & Clearing Charges):** N/A\n* **IGST (@18% of Brok, SEBI, Trans & Clearing Charges):** \u20b9(0.52)\n* **Securities transaction tax:** \u20b9(1.00)\n* **SEBI turnover fees:** \u20b9(0.01)\n* **Stamp duty:** N/A\n* **Net amount receivable/(payable by client):** \u20b90.61\n\nAfter all these deductions, I was left with a whopping \u20b90.61 from my \u20b95 profit \ud83d\ude11 . Let that sink in. The taxes and fees ate up almost everything.\n\nHow do people manage to make any real profit with all these charges? It feels really discouraging for someone who's just trying to learn and make a little money.\n\nAny tips for a beginner like me to handle these fees and still come out ahead? Or is this something we all just have to deal with?\n\nThanks for listening.\n\n[Contract note from zerodha](https://preview.redd.it/bbvdbzz9bogd1.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=e37ae238a7c7fbb6537a69781e7f08392757481f)",

        "selftext": "Bharti Airtel @ 1021- I think, eventually Airtel will beat Jio as they have control of the middle-class to upper-middle-class market due to their much better customer service, and the Middle Class of India is growing rapidly. Airtel also did a great job expanding into Africa, so they can repeat the same processes in other regions of Africa and maybe South America.\n\nTata Power @ 388 - Renewable Energy will have to be the future as AI uses extreme amounts of energy. Tata Power is the best stock to take advantage of this as they continue building more plants around India and partnering with different states to invest in renewable energy. The company also holds the highest number of EV charging stations which I think will be extremely useful in the next decade. The management is also good.\n\nKNR Infra @ 249 - I wanted to invest in the infra sector as that's where the government spending is. KNR has good fundamentals and finishes projects ahead of time, they also have relatively low debt.\n\nLemon Tree Hotels @ 117 - My newest Investment. All the hotels and reviews of the company are generally positive. (4.5 stars) They provide fairly affordable hotels for upper-midscale, midscale, and economy segments where there is relatively low competition in India. The company also aims to heavily increase its number of rooms & hotels by 2028. I had a good experience visiting two of their hotels. \n\n  \nKPIT Tech @ 1366 - Even though many think it's overvalued, I disagree. It's basically the only Indian company doing heavy R&D on Autonomous vehicles and AI-related automobiles. The company also has expanded into 13 other countries where it can leverage the higher incomes and facilities to develop new patents.\n\n  \nTCS @ 3526 - I don't have much invested in this as I only did to investnifty50 companies, I have also put in L&T  and ICICI.\n\n  \nI'm a relatively young investor and tried to research as much as possible to invest, these are the summary of my research. I have put in almost 9 lakh combined (not all is my money). I am willing to invest for 15 to 20 years unless anything unordinary happens and don't really have a target price. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n ",

Don't buy all in one shot, start a weekly/monthly investment plan. This helps unit cost averaging.\n\n3. Go with roughly this breakdown but slightly adjust based on your risk factor: 70% BROAD market etf or mutual fund. 20% Gov of India debt fund/etf, 10% metal fund/etf.\n\nEx: MOTILAL OSWAL NIFTY 500 ETF. Buys top 500 biggest companies but also includes mid and small cap companies. \n\nWhy?\nBecause we don't time the market, it's always a losing bet, especially for long term investing. That's why start SIP regardless of where market is. If it goes down you buy more. Take profits in what the INDEX gives hence you're buying NIFTY 500 or NIFTY 250 broad market fund so you buy little of all companies. Debt fund helps hedge against stock market uncertainty/depression and so does gold fund.\n\nConsistently, top university research has shown broad market instruments like ETF, MF that follow index REGULARLY beat fund managers or individual stocks. Long time in market, and buying close to the WHOLE market will keep your money growing. Don't be an idiot that tries to 10x money overnight.

When I did this, I was not aware that STP is not allowed via liquid fund into the S&P fund. I came to know about the addendum after a few days when I wanted to start the STP. Should I do a daily SWP (I don\u2019t know if this is possible) from the liquid fund into my personal account and from there start daily SIP into the S&P fund. The liquid fund will generate more return than\u00a0 savings bank interest. Or, should I just withdraw one shot and start daily SIP?\n\n\n\n\\> I had a conversation with Motilal Oswal representative and he informed me that more than 7 lakh investment in S&P fund in a financial year will attract 20% TCS.

Eventually, taxpayers had to claim for the TCS as a separate refund during the ITR.\n\nThis year, one of the amendments in the latest Budget is allowing employers to adjust the TCS against the TDS. Employees can now declare their TCS to the employer, allowing the tax adjustment accordingly.\n\nDoes it make the investment in foreign funds (Mutual funds or Direct Equity) little bit attractive now, since after the adjustment the in-hand monthly salary would be increased as they don't have to wait till the end of the financial year?",

This decline was led by major IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which reached a 52-week low, and Tech Mahindra (TechM), which fell by approximately 6%. Persistent Systems also faced substantial losses, with its stock dropping around 6%. This sell-off was largely influenced by global market trends, particularly the disappointing earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia, which triggered a ripple effect across international markets, including India.\n\nThe broader market sentiment was also negative, with the Sensex falling over 1,000 points and the Nifty dropping below the 22,300 mark. This broad-based sell-off affected multiple sectors, including auto, metals, and banking. Factors contributing to the decline include global economic uncertainty, profit booking across markets, and the impact of Nvidia's earnings report. Despite these challenges, the IT sector remains a crucial component of India's economy, though ongoing global uncertainties pose significant risks.",

The model outputs SQL queries in response to natural language questions like:\n\n- \u201cWhat was the net_profit of INFY on 2021-03-31?\u201d\n- \u201cWhat\u2019s the 30-day moving average of TCS close price on 2023-02-01?\u201d\n- \u201cShow me YoY growth of EPS for RELIANCE.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s 100% offline \u2014 no APIs, no cloud calls \u2014 and ships with a DuckDB file preloaded with the dataset. You can paste the model\u2019s SQL output into DuckDB and get results instantly. You can even add your own data without changing the schema.\n\nBuilt this as a proof of concept for how useful small LLMs can be if you ground them in actual structured datasets.\n\nIt\u2019s live on Hugging Face here:  \n**https://huggingface.co/StudentOne/Nifty50GPT-Final**\n\nWould love feedback if you try it out or have ideas to extend it.

Similarly, Persistent Systems has been gaining relative momentum recently. On the other hand, Wipro and TCS are showing signs of losing momentum, although both are still maintaining positions above key benchmarks.\n\n**Lagging Quadrant:** Mphasis, currently in the lagging quadrant, is demonstrating strong momentum and may soon transition to the improving quadrant. Tech Mahindra (Tech M) some uptick in momentum but can underperform the benchmark in the near-term.  HCL Tech is underperforming the benchmark and it losing momentum Within IT basket, HCL Tech remains the weakest stock in terms of momentum and relative strength.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/el1h1wu4gf3e1.jpg?width=1664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=caa793a65e4025dfac99cccc2ac39b62a35bbcd9\n\n",

This decline was led by major IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which reached a 52-week low, and Tech Mahindra (TechM), which fell by approximately 6%. Persistent Systems also faced substantial losses, with its stock dropping around 6%. This sell-off was largely influenced by global market trends, particularly the disappointing earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia, which triggered a ripple effect across international markets, including India.\n\nThe broader market sentiment was also negative, with the Sensex falling over 1,000 points and the Nifty dropping below the 22,300 mark. This broad-based sell-off affected multiple sectors, including auto, metals, and banking. Factors contributing to the decline include global economic uncertainty, profit booking across markets, and the impact of Nvidia's earnings report. Despite these challenges, the IT sector remains a crucial component of India's economy, though ongoing global uncertainties pose significant risks.",

However, what investors will closely watch is the commentary regarding its future outlook. \n\nDemand for air travel is set to pick up from fiscal year starting April 1, driven by the addition of new airports in Delhi and Mumbai. Foreign brokerages Citigroup and Morgan Stanley seem as optimistic, if not more, than local analysts regarding India\u2019s equity market.\n\nThe cost of hedging foreign-exchange risk in Indian assets has climbed to its highest level in more than two years, as speculation mounts that authorities might be easing their iron grip on the rupee.

Assume I have exhausted all the 7L limit.\n\n\nBtw, no limit for judges, babus, mp, mla on gold and land.\n\nThe sons, grandsons of government job holders who claim to be middle class, but in reality they are educated, raised  using the pension, salary, bribe, of their parents and grandparents, who were and are horrible unproductive, and are totally useless for India aren't net positive tax payers. So please don't pretned to be a middle class tax payer when your dad gets to get your grandmother treated at any hospital for free and you get to study in kv for free.\n\n\n\n\n\nReal issue of the post: \n\n\n\nLet's say I want to invest 100$ per month in Tesla for Next 5 years.  I will have to earn at least 175$ per month.\n\nCount INCOME TAX AND TCS.\n\nThe RBI will retur me after 9 to 18 months the 25$ it took away from me.\n\n\nI want to then re invest that 25% into tesla, guess what. I pay again 20% TCS to the RBI, on the returned 25$.\n\n\n\n\nSo the RBI has a continuous stream of incoming dollars from me, without taking any risks.\n\n\nWhen I sell tesla after 10 years, the RBI again makes 15 to 21% as taxes on the gains.  \n\nThe RBI never gets any loss either, you can't carry forward losses in your investment in Tesla.\n\n\n\nThe Gaslighting:\n\n\nThe way the system is set up: \n\n\nI have 1Lakh Rupees, I want to buy Tesla stock, I will get dollars of 79000 only to buy Tesla.  ( TCS charges).\n\n\n\nHowever, \n\nThe entire 1Lakh was converted into dollars, the 20% dollars were taken away by the RBI.\n\n\nRead it again.\n\n\n\nThe RBI tells you that TCS will returned back to you in INR terms, ie 20% of the INR amount you wanted to be converted.\n\n\nBut the value of the 20% INR into dollars is taken away by the RBI.\n\n\nEverytime you buy Tesla, rbi keeps 20% in DOLLAR terms with themselves.\n\n\n\nHow does it matter to you?\n\n\nWhen you ask your own money back after 9 to 18 months, \n\n*You will be  returned the  INR amount*.\n\n\nYou lost Tesla opportunity, you lost INR interest, you lost dollars, and you will again pay 20% of the 20% which was returned back to you, and you will obviously be able to fetch lesser dollars in those 20 than you would have 18 months back.\n\n\n\nPeople loose \n\nInterest amount, + 1 % currency depreciation rate.\n\n\n\nNow imagine how much the RBI is making by trading dollars.  Well, no need to imagine, uph can look it up officially on their websites.\n\n\n\nThe RBI literally takes away the dollars you bring via your job, exports, and gives it to the sons and daughters of their own cabal to party lavishly abroad.\n\n\nThey are able to get away with such a trick because people only care about reservation and reservation,  nothing else. The opposition has no interest in questioning the government on this.\n\n\n\n\nI want to know, how do I point it out to US department of commerce and WTO, so that proportionally equal measures are employed on US companies,.US CITIZENS, by taking away 20% of their capitals when they want to invest in Indian markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "\nWe refuse to give money to rent seekers, non innovative doing, exploiting, wage compressing, pf blocking, insurance denying, companies like Infy, RIL, etc..\n\n\n\nHere is how The RBI has been screwing with people like me since 2020.\n\n\n\n1 - They banned Indmoney,  SBM bank. \n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2023/01/23/india-central-bank-orders-sbm-local-unit-to-stop-outward-remittance-transactions/\n\n\n\n\nThe reason they give is that the RBI can only print rupees, not dollars, which they consider junk currency. How dare a common person refuse to become a bagholder of non-innovative Indian companies!\n\n\n\n2 -\n\nThey barred mutual funds from investing in overseas markets. Most of the gains made by PPFS mutual funds are due to IEX, CDSL, Google, and rupee depreciation.\n\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/mf/mf-news/ppfas-mutual-fund-stops-fresh-inflows-in-flexi-cap-fund/articleshow/89223892.cms\n\n\nReason : \n\nHow will the sons-in-law of Sitaraman and Gadkari get dollars for their weddings? Who will pay for the foreign trips, sabbaticals, and study tours of worthless government officers, judges, and consultants?.\n\n\n\n\n3 -\n\nThey removed indexation from debt mutual funds in March 2023. This means all mutual funds investing in companies that don't pay bribes to government officials, MPs, and MLAs will be taxed at 33%.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-removes-long-term-tax-benefits-debt-mutual-funds-source-2023-03-24/\n\n\n\nReason: \n\nHow will the sons, daughters, and cousins of tax-concealing, bribe-seeking, bribe-giving traders do MBA abroad? The shop owner is paying zero taxes, employing 14-year-old children on the shop floor, claiming all deductions, and underreporting profits.\n\n\n4 -\n\nThey banned a very specific type of mutual fund in March 2024, which invests in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq via cheap ETFs like VOO, VTI, QQQ, and QQQM.\n\nhttps://www.businesstoday.in/mutual-funds/story/sebi-asks-amfi-to-stop-accepting-fresh-inflows-in-overseas-etfs-from-april-1-422416-2024-03-21\n\n\n\nThis was the *cheapest* way to invest in U.S.  markets for normal people like you and me.\n\n\n\n\nBut they have not banned mutual funds that don't buy cheap ETFs but buy stocks and have *VERY HIGH EXPENSE* ratios.\n\nBut they are banning you from following the most common advice given by Warren Buffett: keep buying VOO or VTI forever and you'll outperform almost everyone else.\n\nThink about it.\n\nBlackRock is coming and is going to launch a mutual fund for foreign markets. How dare the citizens of India access the U.S. market via a cheap mutual fund investing in cheap Vanguard VOO?\n\nDo they care about you when you invest in crypto? Hell no. They want the dollars to send their children abroad.\n\nThat's why they put a 20% TCS on every dollar conversion you do. If you buy $100 of Tesla stock per month, you need to earn $175 per month (around $50 for income taxes, $25 for TCS).\n\nIf you even dare to ask for a return in income tax, they reject any claims by opening reassessments of previous years. This means for every $100 SIP in Tesla or Amazon, they will keep taking $70 forever, every month, always.\n\nThe RBI is directing all this. Their sons and daughters want to be a better class of Indians abroad. They don't want 'cattle class' Indians doing MS and MBA abroad. That's why they are gatekeeping by depreciating the rupee and blocking every access of the common man to dollar-based companies.\n\nRemember, they want investment from Tesla in India so the land bank they grabbed from farmers using insider information can be overvalued, but they will behead anyone who invests in Tesla by using the Black Money Act.",

I used to pass through their building, and It may sound funny but one of the reasons to check the company was because I liked their office names. I started investing in the PPFAS mutual fund and the persistent system was one of the top holdings. I bought shares worth 45K in 2018. Sold 1/3rd in 2021 and again in 2022 to get advantage of 1 lakh LTCG tax-expectation. Also bought TATA elixir during the same period and sold it when it became 2X.\n\nI did make some money but after seeing the further growth I promised myself that I would never sell  \nunless there is something seriously wrong with the companies I am holding. Have not sold a single stock since March 2022, Remaining 15k of the persistent system is now 2.60 lakhs (17X) in 6 years. I have HDFC Bank, ITC, Persistent System, Arman Finance, Maruti, Titan, ICICI Bank, TCS, and NMDC in my portfolio.\n\nI know my XIRR (22%) may not be impressive in today\u2019s scenario but I would suggest don\u2019t sell your  \nwinner for a small gain. If you are holding good companies, there is potential it could be 25X or 50X in the long term. Also, think what difference it will make to your wealth if u even make 5k in 6 months on a 10k investment. It will surely make a difference if u make 2.5 lakh from 10k. \u00a0\n\nEdit.

This surge was primarily fueled by the building construction and infrastructure sectors, which together account for 43% of copper consumption and contribute approximately 11% to the GDP. \u200b[Link](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/coal/copper-demand-in-india-rises-13-in-fy24-infra-and-building-sectors-drive-growth/116147769?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Import Statistics**: India imported approximately 363,000 tonnes of refined copper cathodes in the last fiscal year, primarily from Japan. Despite domestic production of 555,000 tonnes, the country still faces a supply gap due to growing demand. \u200b[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/adani-smelter-expansion-will-cut-indias-refined-copper-imports-government-says-2024-12-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Key Sectoral Contributions**:\n   * **Building Construction**: Demand increased by 15% year-on-year, driven by the growing use of copper wiring and cables in construction projects.\n   * **Infrastructure Expansion**: The infrastructure sector saw a 14% year-on-year growth in copper demand, particularly in the transmission and distribution of electricity.\n   * **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: The transportation sector experienced a 41% year-on-year surge in EV sales, significantly boosting copper demand.\n   * **Net-Zero Transition Technologies**: Copper demand associated with renewable energy systems and EVs rose by 27% year-on-year, highlighting the metal's critical role in India's energy transformation. \u200b[Link](https://www.bigmint.co/insights/detail/india-copper-demand-soars-by-13-y-o-y-in-fy24-driven-by-growth-in-key-sectors-606970?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Domestic Production and Strategic Investments**\n   * Hindustan Copper Limited hold mine lease of 80% of India's copper reserves.\n   * HCL used to be the only vertically integrated copper company. however they have moved away from refining and smelting. HCL is now focused on selling Metal in Concentrate(MIC).\n   * HCL has signed MOU with Hindalco(india's largest refined copper producer) for selling copper concentrate.However, the copper mined in india is said to be of inferior quality.\n   * Refined copper capacity had reduced earlier due to closure of vedanta plant in tuticorn(4ook tone per year). However, Kutch Copper(Adani Enterprises) will increase the total production of refined copper by 0.5m tons soon.\n* Kutch copper are sourcing the metal concentrate from Chile.\n* Govt of india has removed custom duty on import of Copper concentrate.\n* Tight supplies have inflated the price of the metal. Treatment and refining charges are now in negative. RC/TCs which are major revenue source for smelters are now in negatives.\n* As price of copper is highly sensitive to geopolitical movement, any movement by trump will affect the Kutch copper. Hindalco has safegaurded itself from geopolitical tensions.\n* Adani Group has recently ventured into the cables and wires sector through a joint venture (JV) named **Praneetha Ecocables Limited (PEL)**. This JV was established in March 2025 between **Kutch Copper Limited (KCL)**, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises, and **Praneetha Ventures Private Limited**.\n* Havells on other hand is integrated with HCL and Hindalco.\n* Kutch copper is becoming vertically integrated with entire adani ecosystem.\n* Higher copper concentrate price is actually bad for refiners because their RC/TC take a hit.\n* Hindalco has most stable supply chain but not much domestic capacity(copper concentrate mined domestically)\n* Adani Kutch copper is most setup for success as they can battle the short supply through GoI induced long term contracts with chilean govt, further vertica integration of copper products and byproducts like sulpher(fertilizers) will reduce its dependence on TC/RC.\n* Copper cathode imports recorded a sharp decline in December and January, after the QCO notified by the Ministry of Mines came into effect on December 1, 2024. it requires the exporter to have BIS certificate, the quality control is more sceintific than the London Metal Exchange, a total of nine foreign suppliers have been certified under the BIS\u2019s copper cathode standard covered by the QCO \u2013 including six from Japan, two from Malaysia, and one from Austria.\n\nShort - fertilizers, cables once the Kutch copper becomes operational.\n\nLong- Hindalco on assumption that it will report good earnings for Q4, due to reduced imports, global market conditions, earnings are reported before kutch plant starts operations. and offcourse Adani Ent.",

They have a growing and youthful population, and their infrastructure and energy consumption are also on the rise. It seems that quite a few investors are eyeing India for its potential growth. (source: The Bid: Is India the next global grothw powerhouse?).\n\nDoes anyone here have experience with the Indian market? Any advice or recommendations before I dive into. I have listed out some potential companies and there is an EFT (iShares MSCI India FTE run buy BlackRock).\n\nI have losted out some potential stocks with chat GPT:\n\t1.\tReliance Industries Limited (RIL) - Reliance continues to be a dominant force in India\u2019s energy, retail, and telecommunications sectors. With its massive investments in digital services and clean energy, Reliance is poised for long-term growth.\n\t2.\tTata Consultancy Services (TCS) - As one of the largest IT services companies in the world, TCS continues to benefit from the global demand for digital transformation services.

This means that people have no clue what you mean by LRS and lakhs and etc. \n2. I suggest you look for ETFs listed on the BSE or NSE that closely track one of the US treasury bill ETFs like IEF and TLT. \n3. I'm not Indian so I have no clue how things work over there but here in Korea there are ETFs listed on the KRX that follow TLT like [this](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/KRX-476760/technicals/) one. If there are any listed on the NSE or BSE, they should have a similar name and contain words such as T-Bond\" and \"USA\". \n4. If you do find such an ETF, do check the holdings of the ETF to see that they are actually holding US gov bonds, you can do this with Yahoo finance under the tab called \"holdings\"",
