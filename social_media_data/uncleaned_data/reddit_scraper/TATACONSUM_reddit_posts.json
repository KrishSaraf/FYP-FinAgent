        "selftext": "Hi Reddit Family,\n\nA bit of context about myself:\n\nI come from a humble background, without any financial inheritance or prior knowledge of investing. I\u2019ve worked hard to support my family and am currently responsible for my parents and others close to me. At 28, Single and working full-time, I started investing around 2-3 years ago with no prior experience, learning through Reddit, YouTube, and books.\n\nMy focus is on long-term growth, with a goal of reaching 1cr before I turn 30. Achieving this would provide me with a sense of financial security and peace of mind.\n\nTreat me someone who is eager to learn but lacking good network or friends to guide me through these decisions. Your advice would mean a lot to me.\n\nCurrent status of my monthly investment :\n\n* Nifty 50 SIP - Monthly (20k) \n* Nifty next 50 SIP - Monthly (20k) \n* Additional stocks investment - (10k)\n\nSpecifically, I would appreciate your thou/ghts on the following:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e16bz91ij9rd1.png?width=2396&format=png&auto=webp&s=4334e3b3534e987a3f6dfd43a79276fe249d52dd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vlwt7e1ij9rd1.png?width=1910&format=png&auto=webp&s=f136b5c1c098fed073443b724f031b77f6cb83c4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4oh9dc1ij9rd1.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1b772a3e523dd79b61e5aac351ff972f6b3c7da\n\n1. How do you eval/uate my current port/folio, and what improvements could I make?\n2. What actions or strategies should I focus on to potentially reach 1cr before 30? Additionally, how much more investment would be necessary to achieve that goal, currently investing around \\~50/month?\n3. I will be receiving a bonus of approximately 8L next month, what would be the best strategy to invest it wisely?\n\nThank you for your time and expertise. Happy to hear your thou/ghts on how I can improve my approach and avoid common mistakes :)",

With a portfolio already at \u20b940 lakhs, you would need to invest about \u20b92 lakh per month via SIP to meet your financial goals.\n\nI suggest you avoid chasing higher returns by taking unnecessary risks, like investing in penny stocks or derivatives for short-term gains. These can lead to significant losses over time. Instead, focus on consistently growing your capital. Regular investments in mutual funds, combined with a little exposure to stocks (if you understand them), can be a more sustainable way to create wealth. Aim for a 15-16% CAGR as your target rather than running after speculative returns.",
