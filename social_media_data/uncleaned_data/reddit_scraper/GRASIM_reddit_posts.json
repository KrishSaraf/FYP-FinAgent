        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

Will this be the perfect time to start buying Zomato and JioFin shares?\n\nAlso, Asian Paints is facing hard times due to the competition from Grasim and a similar story for many NIFTY50 companies that have reported a decline in revenue/profits. Which companies from NIFTY50 (top 5, top 10, etc) are considered best to invest in right now considering the recent and previous quarters' earnings, growth potential, and other similar factors?\n\nOn the same note, what are the NIFTY50 stocks to avoid, at least for now?",

        "selftext": "Just a advice. \n\nI am not a trader but I made some good money in HAL future, in past two week..\n\nThe stock pe is great and company prospects are strong long term. \n\nIn Future. Just buy one lot , and sell one lot daily. \n\nThe stock has daily movement upto 100 rs. It always crashes from top and rises up from bottom. I don't know the reason but it's happening every day, since I started.\n\nAll you have to do is to squeeze 20, 30 rs profitable trades. \n\nI am an equity investors and hate everything about future and options.\n\nBut instead of timing the market, I like bring down my cost of acquisition down. \n\nAnd i realised, fno is great tool, to reduce my average cost of acquisition.\n\nIn intraday, on hal September future.  if I am wrong and market crashes, I wil be happy to take delivery by September end, and be a bag holder. \n\nBecause for me equity is like land, I wil never sell Untill I need the money.\n\nI always assume everything i buy may crash. \n\nSo this advise is for long-term investors. \n\nSuppose you want to hold hal 300 shares for long term. \n\nI would recommend give it a try in fno market. And take delivery if you are wrong.\n\nI bought hal at 4800. I was wrong and it went down to 4500 twice. So don't take stocks advise from me, I am terrible. I am a pure finance freak, but terrible at chart analysis. I neither beleive in it, nor do think it has any indicator just your imagination.\n\nBut, after a day I started swing trade on HAL future, with intention to take delivery if I am wrong. \n\nAfter all good or bad calls, without any chart reading. \n\nCost of hal shares acquisition is now at 3600. \n\nMy goal with swing trades is not make money, just bring my acquisition cost down. \n\nI know market will crash, and HAL will crash too. \n\nBut all i want is to bring down my acquisition cost. \n\nSo if you like the idea, give it a try. \n\nDon't trade it for profits. Just focus on bringing the cost of acquisition down.\n\nI would love to do chart reading and technical analysis. But neither i understand it, believe in charts nor do I have the time all day, to pursue it.\n\nMy strategy is simple. I take 2 to 4 lots, which I can afford to take delivery if I am completely wrong. I buy around 10:30, i sell above 50 rs, I don't trade intraday for profits or keep stop loss. I repeat the cycle twice in a day, that's all the time I have for stock market. \n\nThis won't work permanently  and  i don't know if I am right. But it is working for me. I thought I should share with you. \n\nFno is a curse, I won't advice anyone.. the only reason I trade in September future is because, I need a month's time to arrange Money for delivery. Because I trade with assumption I am wrong. My only concern is my acquisition cost. Bringing it down gives me joy.\n\nI never plan to sell anything, or buy for short term. \n\n60000 crore was lost Last year in future and options.  So i don't want to encourage that behaviour. This advice is only for people who want to hold HAL for long term. If you are wrong, you have to take delivery after 2 months, if you are right, you bring down your cost everyday. \n\nI have tried this with Sriram finance, grasim, srf. I had average success. Nothing to be proud of or worth my time. As I am not full time trader. But in HAL it's just magical. \n\nI have never shorted any share i listed here. I don't bet on nifty or stock  crashing. Not because of morals, but because of simple maths, market and stock goes up every year. So it's easier for me to profit, when it goes up, then to predict everyday when it will go down. \n\nYou can use reverse strategy if you are seller or bear. It works both ways. But i wanna be wrong if HAL goes down, rather then being right about it. \n\nI am open to learn. If I am wrong.  You won't hurt my feelings, you can speak your mind. If this is stupid advice. \n\nTo trigger you guys more, I don't understand nifty or trade in benchmark index. Because for me company i like, is more important then index. I want hal, sriram finance, srf, grasim to do better. Many others which I can't list. Because they are extremely good buisness imo, i would love them to succeed! \n",
