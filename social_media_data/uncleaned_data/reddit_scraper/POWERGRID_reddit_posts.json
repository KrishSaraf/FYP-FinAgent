        "selftext": "   Power Grid Corporation of India (POWERGRID) is a dominant player in the Indian power transmission sector. Here's a summary of its strengths to help you decide on investing:\n * Strong financial performance: Powergrid has a healthy track record of profitability and dividend payouts.\n * Monopoly position: The company enjoys a near-monopoly position in the interstate power transmission segment in India.\n * Government backing:  Being a government-owned company, Powergrid benefits from a certain degree of stability.\nHowever, there are also some factors to consider:\n * Limited growth potential: The company's growth might be limited due to its already established network.\n * Regulatory environment: The power sector is subject to government regulations, which can impact profitability.\nOverall, Powergrid is a relatively low-risk investment option with a steady dividend yield. However, its growth potential might be limited. Consider your investment goals and risk tolerance before making a decision.  Financially, POWERGRID maintains solid fundamentals. For 2024, the company reported net income of \u20b9155 billion and sales of \u20b9458 billion, with projections for 2025 indicating growth to \u20b9160 billion in net income and \u20b9472 billion in sales. The company also offers a dividend yield of around 3.8% to 3.88%, making it attractive for income-focused investors \n\n",

        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

The stock has broken its support level and closed below it, signaling a bearish sentiment. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.\n\nAdditionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance. What is your opinion?",

        "selftext": "We all know that **PFC (Power Finance Corporation),** is in the spotlight with the upcoming budget session due to focus on energy & power sector. Also since ***Bernstein*** has already ***pointed out*** why this stock is a ***good pick fundamentally***, I will simply reiterate those points: (i) trading a low price-to-earnings ratio of 9x as compared to industry average of 31x, and (ii) India is likely to add 300GW of power generation capacity in the next six years (whereas India added 100GW of power generation capacity in the last six years) so PFC's business is also likely to grow.   \n  \nBernstein's ***price target is 650*****,** but the ***current market price is only at 550*** levels! \n\nNow comes the most interesting part - option data shows over 60 lakh+ call options have been sold at strikes 550 and 560! On the other hand futures open interest data shows that around 5 crore future contracts were sold between 25-28 June, when PFC was trading below 500 levels and out of which only around 50-70 lakh contracts have been squared off. That's a sea of shorts who will be forced to cover their positions by buying the stock if the price moves upwards towards Bernstein's target of 650!\n\nLets also look at the chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v13gej5tuabd1.jpg?width=2541&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f77d6d71ed6fe06bd3f1b07f754b72322d632022\n\nIt looks like PFC has broken the middle of this rising channel, tested the middle as the support, and has rise again. Also we can see that every time this channel's middle is broken in the upwards direction, the top of the channel has been tested. The only immediate resistance that I can see is at 560, but once that is broken, there seems to be no resistance up until Bernstein's target of 650. So it seems plausible that more short covering is about to happen isn't it?  \n\n\n**Disclaimer: This ain\u2019t financial or investment advice, it\u2019s just a few observations. Remember to do your own research. \ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udcaa**",

So i would be getting good profit from \"fractions of stocks\" like Unilever/SBI/Reliance who have survived this 20 year ride.  , so ultimately i would be receiving very less profit when i redeem in 2024 as valuations of All other stocks has reduced too much \n\nI know my theory is incorrect, but please explain how it works actually",

The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.\n\nAdditionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance.",

Again, not a Covid investor myself, but the assumption that risks are necessary for market-beating rewards is not a sane theory. You can, and should, aim to beat the markets at your ideal risk appetite, and then compare the risk-reward against your beta when benchmarking. This is, in essence, the efficient market hypothesis.\n\n2. Red and green hota rehta hai. Good that you're enjoying tropical paradise abhi, and congrats on the same. But Bees is just a basket of stocks, and nothing more than that. It's not inherently bad, it's like trading on an index-linked ETF when you don't have a clear picture about the constituents, but like the theme.

Examples would include APPL at IPO, NVDA 5 years ago, or AMZN. \n\nWhat I\u2019m currently thinking is anything nuclear, utilities (mainly electricity/powergrid), cyber security, and space exploration/tourism. I saw the run up in ASTS and figured it was a good time to start dipping my hands into some companies that have solid outlooks. I have also made significant gains on NVDA during the bull run, and subsequent bear run (Jan 17th $8 Calls on NVDQ), and looking to buy the dip in any tech stocks. \n\nI\u2019m also 19 so I have time on my side when it comes to these picks.",

Takes like 1-2 decades for a plant to come on-line. Few companies really have the desire and capital to build them. SMRs need to be the play but progress on developing them has stalled. \n\nUtilities (my industry) is not a growth stock. It's a dividend stock that you keep in your portfolio to hedge against volatility and downturns. You also have to understand how utilities make money as they are a regulated industry. \n\nCyber security is the only good play you listed, but you really need to understand the technology and the current trends. Cyber spend also tends to the first thing to go out the window during hard financial times - which is chuckleheaded but whatever. \n\nSpace exploration...lol, no.
