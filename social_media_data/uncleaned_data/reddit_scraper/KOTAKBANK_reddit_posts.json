But a substantial sum out of this has been invested in the last 3-4 months.\n\nPoint is to review the portfolio / allocation etc. as it stands today - for the future. That is why I have provided current value of holdings (though invested sum can be calculated pretty easily). Past gains (especially %ages) are indicative of pretty much nothing as I have been irregular in buying and accumulating over the said period.\n\nWould love everyone's views and opinions. \n\nPS - discerning folks on here will be able to see Saurabh Mukherjea's influence but even more discerning (and sympathethic) folks will be able to see I am reducing the said influence now \ud83d\ude04\n\nLATE (AND LONG) EDIT - As rightly said in some replies, MF portfolio has some unnecessary over-complication. I'm slowly moving my inv from Axis ELSS to PP ELSS (as and when 3 year limit ends), so count one less fund. The two PP funds again I count as basically one big Flexi fund, so that's again one less fund. Small caps I don't feel comfortable with just one fund, and the universe is large enough to accommodate two funds. \nSo basically-\n\u2022one Largecap (Niftybees) \n\u2022one Flexicap (2 PPs + whatever's left of Axis)\n\u2022one Large & Mid\n\u2022one Midcap\n\u2022two Smallcaps\n\u2022one USA (where in fact if someone can suggest which should I actually invest in, anyway PP Flexi can't invest more in the US stocks). \n\n",

I usually wait for my stocks to hit a certain price before I take out the principal amount and the profit remains invested in the stock itself. I try to choose stocks with good fundamentals and have not consistently invested in a stock because I may not have the patience for it right now and also my capital is limited. I know no. of stocks are greater compared to the capital invested but some of my bets take more time to give returns and some are impulse decisions that I intend to cut down.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ld9hhon6nn7d1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c5879dcb970cdd0a5cf39ce40e3e0540a471655\n\nPlease give your valuable suggestions regarding the portfolio and the strategy I use. I am directing all my monthly savings to mutual funds as of now and have stopped putting any money directly in equity.",
