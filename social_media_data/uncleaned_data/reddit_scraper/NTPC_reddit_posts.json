        "selftext": "**1. Company fundamentals**\n\nNTPC Green Energy Limited is owned by NTPC Limited. It is India's largest power generation company. The company has a lot of positives such as:\n\n**Strong Parentage:**\u00a0Company is backed by NTPC Limited, a state-owned enterprise, which provides NTPC Green with financial stability and access to resources.\n\n**Company Growth:** NTPC Green Energy has seen a revenue growth rate of 46.82%, increasing from \u20b9910.42 crore in FY 2022 to \u20b91,962.60 crore in FY 2024. The profit after tax has been growing at a CAGR of 90.75%, increasing from \u20b994.74 crore in FY 2022 to \u20b9344.72 crore in FY 2024.\n\n**Government Support:** The Indian government's emphasis on renewable energy and\u00a0policies such as 24x7 power for all, Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, PLI schemes and multiple green energy schemes can benefit NTPC Green.\n\n2. **Issue size and split**\n\nThe size of the\u00a0IPO is Rs. 10000 crore and the\u00a0minimum investment is Rs. 14,904 for retail investors.\n\nThe NTPC Green Energy IPO is a\u00a0**purely fresh issue**, meaning there is\u00a0**no Offer For Sale (OFS)**\u00a0component.\u00a0This is a huge green flag since we know that all proceeds from the IPO will go directly to the company and will not be cashed out by existing promoters.\n\n3. **Brand name and experienced Management**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the company is a subsidiary of state-owned NTPC Ltd. The key management team is experienced and has good expertise in the power sector.\n\nThe management is led by CEO Mr. Rajiv Gupta, CFO Mr. Neeraj Sharma and company secretary Mr. Manish Kumar.\n\n4. **Valuation**\n\nNTPC Green is aiming for a valuation of around $12 billion, which is one of the biggest valuations in the renewable energy sector.\n\nThe company's PE ratio of 148 is higher than its smaller peers but is lesser than its bigger rival Adani Green Energy's PE ratio of 260. The valuation is considered reasonable, given the company's strong fundamentals, growth prospects, and the government's push for renewable energy.\n\n5. **Clear Use of Proceeds**\n\nThe\u00a0company proposes to use the proceeds from the IPO towards investment in the wholly-owned subsidiary, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (NREL), for repay\u00a0debts of subsidiary NTPC Renewable Energy and the remaining for general corporate purposes.\n\nWhile this may raise questions among investors, repayment of debts also comes with positives such as reduced loans, reduce in interest outflow for company and increase in profits after tax (PAT).\n\n6. **Strong underwriting team**\n\nReputable underwriters or investment banks backing the IPO signal credibility and thorough due diligence.\n\nThe book-running lead managers or underwriters to the issue are\u00a0IDBI Capital Market Services Limited, HDFC Bank Limited, IIFL Securities Ltd and Nuvama Wealth Management Limited. The issue's registrar is Kfin Technologies Limited.\n\n7. **QIB subscription**\n\nWhen the big players are subscribing in the beginning, without coming the last moment for filling the QIB quota, we can believing that QIBs are genuinely interested in the IPO and company. So observe the QIB subscription numbers throughout all 3 days of the IPO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nThis IPO is mostly positive, you can invest money according to your risk appetite.",

                "body": "Hey,\n\nNTPC Green Energy is launching a \u20b910,000 crore IPO, the third-largest of the year after Hyundai and Swiggy.\n\nBefore getting into the pros and cons of this IPO, let me give you a basic overview of this company.\u00a0\n\nNTPC Green Energy is India's fourth-largest solar energy player, following Adani Green, ReNew Power, and Tata Power. It is a subsidiary of NTPC and was established in April 2022 to consolidate NTPC\u2019s renewable energy assets. It focuses on solar and wind energy and works on large-scale projects for PSUs and Indian corporations.\n\nBy September 2024, they had an operational capacity of 3,300 MW across six states, secured contracts for 13,600 MW, and a project pipeline of 9,175 MW. That\u2019s over 26,000 MW of capacity in total.\n\nNow let\u2019s move into fundamentals\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sp274n959t1e1.jpeg?width=654&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e4d042f9a77b0d9fea90209a27c17f006685fc4\n\n\u00a0\n\nNTPC Green Energy, established in April 2022, has a short operating history.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s revenue grew significantly from \u20b9171 crore in FY23 to \u20b92,038 crore in FY24, a massive 1,094% increase.\u00a0\n\nProfits also rose from \u20b9171 crore to \u20b9345 crore, showing 101% growth year-on-year.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCash flow from operations surged from \u20b917 crore to \u20b91,600 crore, reflecting strong growth.\u00a0\n\nThe company boasts a high EBITDA margin of 89%, primarily because depreciation and interest are excluded from its calculation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHowever, its return on equity remains low at 5.5%, and the net debt-to-equity ratio is high at 2x as of March 2024.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNow, if I talk about its valuations, They are aiming for a valuation of around $12 billion, making it one of the biggest in the renewable energy sector. \n\nIts price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is 260, higher than Adani Green Energy\u2019s 173, and its price-to-book (PB) ratio is 10, slightly above the industry average. \n\nHowever, this valuation seems reasonable considering the company\u2019s strong fundamentals, growth potential, and the government\u2019s focus on promoting renewable energy.\n\nHow the company will use its proceeds?\n\nThe entire \u20b910,000 crore IPO is a fresh issue, so the funds will directly benefit the company. However, \u20b97,500 crore (75%) is earmarked to repay the debt of its subsidiary, NREL, which raises concerns about the company\u2019s dependency on borrowed funds.\n\nHere are some of the pros and cons of NTPC green energy:\u00a0\n\n**Pros**\n\n**Strong Parent Company:**\u00a0NTPC Green Energy is backed by NTPC, a leader in India\u2019s power sector, benefiting from its expertise and experience.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Growing Industry:**\u00a0Renewable energy is a fast-growing and essential sector for the future.\u00a0\n\n**Rapid Expansion:**\u00a0The company has over 3,300 MW operational capacity and a strong pipeline of around 22,800 MW, providing good growth potential.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Fresh IPO:**\u00a0The IPO is a fresh issue, meaning the funds raised will directly benefit the company and its shareholders.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Clean Track Record:**\u00a0The company has no major legal or liability issues.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Cons**\n\n**Limited History:**\u00a0NTPC Green Energy is relatively new, with just 2.5 years of operating history.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**High Debt and Low Returns:**\u00a0The company has significant debt and low return ratios, paired with high valuations.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0**Debt Dependency:**\u00a0Most of the IPO funds will be used to reduce debt, but high capital expenditure needs may keep debt levels high.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Revenue and Asset Concentration:**\u00a0Dependence on a few key suppliers, assets, and revenue sources poses risks.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo, while the company is in a high-growth sector with solid backing, the heavy debt and steep valuations make it worth considering carefully.",

Its shares shot up by 14%, and now the company is valued at a whopping $12 billion.\n\nWhy is this a big deal? Because it shows that investors are super confident about the future of clean energy in India. The company\u2019s IPO (when shares are sold to the public for the first time) was a massive hit, getting bids worth \u20b9154 billion (about $1.83 billion)\u2014more than double what was expected!\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just hype. NTPC Green Energy\u2019s numbers are strong:\n\nLast year, their profits almost doubled to \u20b93.45 billion.\n\nRevenue grew by 35% to \u20b919.63 billion.\n\nIndia is also playing big in the renewable energy game, with plans to invest $385 billion by 2030. NTPC Green Energy\u2019s success is a clear sign that this sector is full of potential and opportunities.\n\nWhat do you think? Could renewable energy investments like this shape India\u2019s future? Or is there still a long way to go? Let\u2019s discuss! \ud83c\udf31\u26a1",

The stock has broken its support level and closed below it, signaling a bearish sentiment. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.\n\nAdditionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance. What is your opinion?",

        "selftext": "Let the tears flow from the \"experts\" and institutional clowns \ud83e\udd21 who are panic-selling today. While Sensex tanked \\~750 points and Nifty kissed 23,226. The REAL INVESTORS are rubbing their hands like Thanos snapping half the universe. Here\u2019s why these \"crashes\" are a BLESSING:\n\n1.FOREIGNERS DUMPING SHARES? THANK THEM FOR THE DISCOUNT!\n\nFIIs sold \u20b91,327 CRORE worth of stocks post-Budget. Good riddance! These guys have been net sellers since October 2024, and now they\u2019re handing us CHEAP BLUE-CHIPS on a silver platter. Tata Steel, L&T, NTPC \u2013 all down 3-4%? I\u2019ll take your entire stock!\n\n2. TRUMP\u2019S TARIFF TANTRUM = BLACK FRIDAY SALE\n\n25% tariffs on Mexico/Canada and 10% on China? Global markets panicking? WHO CARES. This isn\u2019t 2018. The Modi govt\u2019s tax cuts (\u20b912.75L income = ZERO TAX) will unleash a CONSUMPTION BOOM for FMCG, autos, and durables. Maruti, ITC, Dabur at discounts? Load. The. Boat.\n\n3. MID/SMALLCAP BLOODBATH? PERFECT TIME TO BUY FUTURE MULTIBAGGERS\n\nBSE Midcap/Smallcap down 1-8%? Bharat Dynamics, JP Power, IREDA getting slaughtered? Yes, please! Retail investors with DIAMOND HANDS know corrections are where fortunes are made. Remember 2020? Exactly.\n\n4. \"BUT WHAT ABOUT RBI POLICY UNCERTAINTY!\" \u2013 STFU AND BUY\n\nThe rupee\u2019s at 87/USD, and RBI might cut rates? EVEN BETTER. Cheaper loans = more spending = auto, real estate, and consumer stocks \ud83d\udcc8. Weak hands are selling because they can\u2019t handle volatility. We feast on their fear.\n\n5. GOVT\u2019S \"LACK OF CAPEX\" IS A SMOKESCREEN\n\nSure, railway/defense/infra stocks dipped, but the Budget\u2019s \u20b9500Cr AI fund and MSME credit boost are LONG-TERM WINNERS. Paperhands crying about \"no capex\" don\u2019t understand strategic plays.\n\nCONCLUSION: This \"crash\" is a FIRE SALE for those with vision. The FII exodus and Trump\u2019s meltdown are clearing the path for retail investors to DOMINATE. Stay greedy, buy the dip, and let the panic-sellers fund your retirement.\n\n\u201dbUt heY iT\u2019s A bEaR mArKeT\u201d \u2013 \ud83e\udd13\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udeaa.\n\n(Disclaimer: Not financial advice.

Now that Modi govt. has settled there\u2019s finally room to focus on **long-term economic development** rather than **short-term election-driven policies.**\n\nNow govt. seriously have 2 choices--> **REDUCE TAXES TO PLEASE MIDDLE CLASS OR PRIORTIZE CAPEX.**\n\n**WHAT WILL MAKE MARKET RISE?**\n\n1. **AGGRESSIVE CAPEX spending**\n2. **AI AND GREEN ENERGY incentives, along with expansion in PLI will help companies of auto, semiconductor and electronics sectors.**\n3. **INFRA BOOST** \u2013 **More spending on roads, railways, and power benefits L&T, NTPC, Tata Power, cement & steel stocks.**\n4. **JUST NO CHANGES IN LTCG, STCG AND STT surely will be a plus for the market.**\n5. **A DECREASE IN PERSONAL TAXES will surely be loved by retail investors and as it will help in increasing the spending power of ppl, FMCG shares may see a rise.**\n\n**WHAT WILL MAKE MARKET STUMBLE?**\n\n1. **Hike CAPITAL GAINS or STT** \u2013 **Even a slight increase could be enough to drag the Nifty down by 1,000 points or more.**\n2. **Lack of Disinvestment Push- I've been listening to this since covid, especially for PSU Banks, like seriously they still have not come up with which banks to privatise. Though anything said abt this will make shares rise, nothing said may lead to PSU shares stumbling.**\n3. **High FISCAL DEFICIT & Borrowing** \u2013 **If capex spending is not backed by revenue growth, inflation concerns could spook the bond market and banks.**\n4. **Surprise GST Hikes on Key Sectors** \u2013 **Any increase in GST on luxury goods, autos, or FMCG could hit consumption stocks. And as we see in almost every budget how this affects ITC.**\n\n**The market is in a real imp position, and this budget could make or break the next bull run. If the government focuses on growth, investment, and market-friendly policies, we could finally see Indian markets catching up to global trends. But even one wrong policy move (especially on capital gains tax) could send the markets crashing.**\n\nPS- I'M NO EXPERT, and you may disagree with some of points and that's totally okay!!",

Try to invest in Tata, Mahindra, hdfc, etc. as you are beginner I will suggest you to only invest in companies that you have heard name of and know at least few things about their business",

For critical minerals NMDC, NALCO , vedanta already to compete and better equipped. Dividends will reduce from this year itself ( prediction ). People will tell coal is still need for powerplants yes we need but if coal is cheap internationally and we get high grade coal is better to import. coal india has no pricing power , it only fills Babu's pocket not retail investor pocket. Even Paragh Parik has divested huge amounts of coal india. Over all it is going to be a bad stock for shareholders not a value stock Thoughts?",

                "body": "Take a step back. There are three variables.\n\nInvestment = Dividend / Yield. \n\nIf you know any two, you can find out the third. We know Dividend is 20,000 a month. That is what you want. In other words, 2,40,000 a year. \n\nAnnual Dividend = 2,40,000\n\nLet's think of a company that pays a stable dividend that they will be able to pay month after month, for many years, without much trouble. Some people see ITC as a candidate. It pays a quarterly dividend of Rs. 3.44 every quarter. That is Rs. 13.76 a year per share. \n\nThe amount is not guaranteed but the management tries its best to maintain it. If the company has a good record over 30 years, it's likely to maintain it. \n\nSo if we collect Rs. 13.76 per share, what is the dividend yield?\n\nThat depends on the price at which you bought the share. Right now, the price is 482. If I bought it at this price, and ITC pays 13.76 to me every year, the yield is 13.76 / 482 = 2.85%\n\nLet's say we like it. So yield = 2.85%\n\n---\n\nNow we can calculate the investment needed for your purpose. \n\nInvestment = 2,40,000 / 2.85%\n= 84.21 Lakh\n\nThat is how much money you will have to invest.\n\n---\n\nIt might seem very expensive, and in my opinion, it is. There are a couple of ways of solving this. \n\n1. Find something other than ITC that pays a better yield. The problem is that there aren't too many things out there that can actually pay such a high yield for a long time without going bankrupt. Usually, people who promise such returns disappoint their investors eventually. \n\n2. Lower your expectations. If all you have is 10 lakh to invest, and you aren't willing to gamble your savings away, accept the smaller dividend payment. In the case of ITC, it would be 10 lakh x 2.85% = 28,500 a year. That is 2,375 a month. \n\n3. Don't buy ITC at 482. Buy it when it is cheaper. In 2020, it was trading at 170. The person who buys it at 170 gets paid the same dividend of 13.76 as the person who paid 482. But their yields are different because their purchase price is different. For the person who bought the stock at 170, the yield of 13.76 / 170 = 8%\n\nHow much investment would it take to get a dividend of 2,40,000 a year if the yield was 8%?\n\n2,40,000 / 8% = 30 lakhs\n\nThat is much better than 84.21.\n\nThe point is, the answer to your question depends on how much yield you can get from a safe asset? And companies don't make promises of a specific yield, but they try to protect the rupee amount. If you can buy the stock cheap enough, you can adjust the yield in your favor.\n\n---\n\nNestle pays a low yield from the perspective of those who bought it at Rs. 2,200. But the one who bought it for 200 certainly thinks the yield is very good.",

        "selftext": "I have currently have \u20b98,000 invested in stocks like Bajaj Housing Finance, NTPC Green, Ashok Leyland, and Motherson. Since my portfolio is mostly in housing, energy, and auto, I\u2019m looking to diversify into railways.\n\nAfter researching, I\u2019ve shortlisted RVNL, Titagarh Rail Systems, and Jupiter Wagons. All three have seen solid momentum recently, especially with the \u20b97,927 crore government investment in railway infrastructure. Jupiter surged about 11.82% in a day, Titagarh is expanding into new sectors, and RVNL, as a PSU, could be a stable pick.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n1. Which stock has the best long-term growth potential?\n\n\n2. Would a mix of all three be a better strategy?(I don't think so+ can't afford all:'')\n\n\n3. Any red flags I should watch out for?\n\n\nWould like to know your views",

Also they need to take debt as working capital sometimes interest on which is kind of high in other countries. So this is also a profit dent. These factors were volatile after trump administration came into power so these stocks got halved from their ATH. I think you won't regret buying these companies if you think these factors may get sorted in near future as if it touched their all time high again in next few months your investment would be doubled. I think RVNL is mote stable than these two as RVNL keep getting infrastructure projects by Indian railways.",

I like the mix of stability with blue-chip names like ICICI Bank, NTPC, and REC, balanced with growth plays such as Tata Motors and HAL. Diversifying across sectors like banking, defense, EV, and infrastructure is smart. One suggestion would be to keep an eye on market trends as you wait for the market to stabilize, since timing the entry can be tricky, and always be ready to adjust if the fundamentals change. It might also help to set aside a small portion for liquidity or unforeseen market moves.",

                "body": "### Portfolio Overview\nYou\u2019ve invested in 14 assets: 12 individual stocks, 1 sectoral ETF (Nifty SBI ETF), and 1 gold ETF (Gold Bees). Total allocation sums to 100%, so I assume this is your full portfolio. Here\u2019s the breakdown by sector/type based on your holdings:\n\n- **Energy/PSUs**: NTPC (6.64%), NTPC Green (9.28%), ONGC (6.97%), IOC (4.81%), IRFC (5.56%) \u2013 **33.26%**\n- **Finance**: SBI (7.66%), Manappuram (6.13%), Bajaj Housing Finance (2.55%) \u2013 **16.34%**\n- **Pharma**: Dr. Reddy\u2019s (5.82%), Natco Pharma (6.96%) \u2013 **12.78%**\n- **Auto**: Tata Motors (9.41%) \u2013 **9.41%**\n- **IT**: Wipro (7.23%) \u2013 **7.23%**\n- **FMCG**: ITC (4.87%) \u2013 **4.87%**\n- **ETFs**: Nifty SBI ETF (6.02%), Gold Bees (9.96%) \u2013 **15.98%**\n\n**Key Observations**:\n- Heavy PSU exposure (33.26%), especially energy-related (NTPC, ONGC, IOC, IRFC).\n- Diversified across sectors, but concentrated in a few stocks (e.g., NTPC Green, Tata Motors, Gold Bees each ~9-10%).\n- Current ETF allocation (Nifty SBI + Gold Bees) is ~16%, with intent to increase it.\n\n### Performance Context: Down 20% Since July 2024\nYou started investing in July 2024, and as of March 2, 2025 (8 months later), you\u2019re down 20%. Let\u2019s contextualize this:\n- **Market Trends (July 2024\u2013March 2025)**: The Nifty 50, a broad market benchmark, grew ~5-7% in this period (based on historical trends and assuming no major crash by March 2025). However, midcaps, smallcaps, and PSUs (where you\u2019re heavily invested) saw volatility\u2014some PSU stocks corrected 15-25% after a 2023-early 2024 rally.\n- **Your Portfolio**: A 20% loss suggests your picks underperformed the broader market, likely due to sector-specific declines or stock selection.\n\n**Is This Normal?**: For a beginner starting mid-2024:\n- Yes, it\u2019s possible. Markets don\u2019t always go up, and 2024 saw profit booking in PSU and midcap stocks after a multi-year bull run.\n- No, it\u2019s not ideal. A 20% drop against a flat-to-up broader market indicates some stock-specific or allocation issues.\n\n**Red Flags**:\n- **Wipro**: IT sector faced headwinds in 2024 (US slowdown, fewer contracts). Fundamentally weaker than peers.\n- **PSU Overweight (IRFC, NTPC, ONGC, IOC)**: 2024 saw PSU profit-taking after a 2023 boom\u2014your timing might\u2019ve coincided with this.\n- No glaring \u201cwrong\u201d stocks, but high exposure to volatile PSUs and midcaps likely amplified your loss.\n\n\n- **Current Volatility**: \n  - PSU-heavy (33%) and midcaps (e.g., Manappuram, Natco) are volatile\u201420% drop reflects this.\n  - Gold Bees (10%) and Nifty SBI ETF (6%) are stabilizers, but 16% isn\u2019t enough to offset stock-specific risk.\n- **Plan to Increase Nifty ETF & Gold**:\n  - **Nifty ETF**: Tracks Nifty 50, low volatility (~15-20% annualized), diversified across sectors. Increasing this (e.g., to 15-20%) balances your PSU tilt.\n  - **Gold**: Low correlation to stocks, hedges inflation. Boosting to 15% (from 10%) makes sense\u2014gold\u2019s uptrend in 2024 supports this.\n- **Suggestion**: Trim high-risk stocks (e.g., NTPC Green, Tata Motors\u2014your 9%+ bets) to fund ETFs. Aim for 20% Nifty ETF + 15% Gold (35% low-volatility assets).\n\n### My View on Your Portfolio\n- **Strengths**: Decent diversification (energy, finance, pharma, etc.), some defensive picks (ITC, Gold), PSU exposure taps government growth themes.\n- **Weaknesses**: \n  - Overweight PSUs (33%) at a volatile time\u2014your 20% loss likely stems from this correction.\n  - High single-stock bets (9-10% in Tata Motors, NTPC Green) amplify risk for a beginner.\n  - Wipro\u2019s underperformance is a weak link.\n- **Is Something Wrong?**: Not fundamentally\u2014your stocks aren\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d picks. The issue is timing (bought at peaks?) and allocation (too much in volatile segments).\n- **Normalcy**: A 20% drop in 8 months isn\u2019t rare for a stock-heavy portfolio in a corrective phase, but it\u2019s steeper than the market\u2014adjustments can help.\n\n\n### Recommendations\n1. **Rebalance**:\n   - Reduce NTPC Green, Tata Motors to 5-6% each.\n   - Exit or trim Wipro (swap for a stronger IT stock like Infosys if you want IT).\n   - Boost Nifty ETF to 15-20% and Gold Bees to 15%.\n2. **Hold Steady**: ITC, Dr. Reddy\u2019s, SBI, ONGC are solid\u2014don\u2019t panic-sell losses.\n3. **Learn Timing**: Use SIPs for ETFs to avoid buying at peaks.\n4. **Review**: Check your cost price vs. March 2025 levels\u2014share specifics if you want deeper analysis.",

Need your opinion on wether i made the correct choice or not? (Edited this line)\n\nHere's the list of stocks that i put a buying order for -\n\n* coal india - 20 shares, each for - 525\n* SBI - 10 shares, each for 810\n* ONGC - 50 shares, each for 323\n* NTPC - 40 shares, each for 407.55\n* Tata steel - 20 shares, each for 151.12\n\nI had some cash remaining in hand and saw some good dips on stocks that i had been looking at for a while and all of these had good fundamentals and were rated buy on indmoney and  [trendlyne](https://trendlyne.com/markets-today-loggedin/).\n\ni am doubtful about my impromptu buying and i know that this can cause a lot of issues for me in the future if i don't learn the discipline to control myself. How can i get better at this and not jump into every chance i see?",

So, they will have more value in Rs. according to this.   \nThey have mroe liquid to dump in this cheaper market. Similarly, the DIIs can double down on their prices giving more good risk-reward ratio in fundamentally good companies.\n\nThis will excite the retail investors to invest again pushing the overall index up to a new target 27K. Good swing trade opporutnites here.  \nVolume can be a good indicator for stocks where there is heavy buying. \n\nSome stocks are simply hitting UC from last 2-3 sessions. There is definite heavy buying for a good rally in coming months IG.\n\nViews can be wrong, if so correct me. Thanks",

Let\u2019s break it down stock by stock.\n\n\n### Stock-by-Stock Review\n\n1. **Varun Beverages Ltd (VBL)**  \n   - **400 shares @ \u20b9465.13** (Recent addition)  \n   - **Cost**: \u20b91,86,052  \n   - **Sector**: FMCG (Beverages)  \n   - **Thoughts**: VBL, the PepsiCo bottler, has been a strong performer historically due to its monopoly-like position in India\u2019s bottling market and expansion into new geographies. Your entry price of \u20b9465.13 seems reasonable (assuming this is adjusted for splits; VBL underwent a 2:5 split in 2023, so pre-split prices were higher). The FMCG sector tends to be defensive, and VBL\u2019s growth in snacks (e.g., Cheetos deal in Morocco) adds upside potential. Posts on X from February 2025 highlighted JP Morgan\u2019s bullish stance on VBL, suggesting optimism from institutional investors. Keep an eye on volume growth and input cost pressures (e.g., sugar, PET resin).\n\n2. **Clean Science and Technology Ltd**  \n   - **100 shares @ \u20b91,379**  \n   - **Cost**: \u20b91,37,900  \n   - **Sector**: Specialty Chemicals  \n   - **Thoughts**: Clean Science is a high-quality player in the specialty chemicals space, benefiting from the China+1 trend and strong margins. However, the chemical sector can be cyclical, and your entry at \u20b91,379 might be on the higher side if the stock hasn\u2019t rallied significantly since. Check its recent quarterly results\u2014margin compression or export slowdowns could explain any underperformance.\n\n3. **Jio Financial Services Ltd (Jiofin)**  \n   - **500 shares @ \u20b9233** (Recent addition)  \n   - **Cost**: \u20b91,16,500  \n   - **Sector**: Financial Services  \n   - **Thoughts**: Jio Financial, a Reliance spin-off, is a bet on digital finance and lending growth. At \u20b9233, your entry aligns with its early trading range post-listing in 2023. It\u2019s a high-potential but speculative pick, as its business model is still evolving. Inclusion in the NSE F&O segment in November 2024 (as per web data) could boost liquidity and volatility. Patience is key here\u2014monitor its progress in lending and tech-driven offerings.\n\n4. **Devyani International Ltd**  \n   - **505 shares @ \u20b9157**  \n   - **Cost**: \u20b979,285  \n   - **Sector**: QSR (Quick Service Restaurants)  \n   - **Thoughts**: Devyani (KFC, Pizza Hut operator) is another consumer-facing stock with growth potential tied to India\u2019s rising dining-out trend. Your \u20b9157 entry is decent, though recent block deals (e.g., Yum Restaurants selling a 4.4% stake at \u20b9153.5 in February 2024) might have pressured the price. JP Morgan\u2019s overweight stance on consumer stocks like Devyani (X post) is encouraging. Watch same-store sales growth (SSSG) and expansion plans.\n\n5. **HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd**  \n   - **110 shares @ \u20b9667**  \n   - **Cost**: \u20b973,370  \n   - **Sector**: Insurance  \n   - **Thoughts**: HDFC Life is a solid long-term pick in the underpenetrated Indian insurance market. At \u20b9667, your entry is close to its historical trading range. Insurance stocks can be slow movers but offer stability. Check its VNB (Value of New Business) growth and persistency ratios in recent quarters\u2014any dip could explain your portfolio\u2019s loss.\n\n6. **Laurus Labs Ltd**  \n   - **150 shares @ \u20b9466**  \n   - **Cost**: \u20b969,900  \n   - **Sector**: Pharmaceuticals  \n   - **Thoughts**: Laurus Labs has exposure to APIs, generics, and CDMO (contract development and manufacturing). The pharma sector has been volatile due to US pricing pressures and raw material costs. Your \u20b9466 entry might be near its 2023-2024 range, but if it hasn\u2019t broken out, it could be weighing on your returns. Look at its CDMO pipeline for future catalysts.\n\n7. **Central Depository Services Ltd (CDSL)**  \n   - **60 shares @ \u20b91,208** (Recent addition)  \n   - **Cost**: \u20b972,480  \n   - **Sector**: Depositories/Financial Infrastructure  \n   - **Thoughts**: CDSL benefits from rising demat accounts and market participation in India. At \u20b91,208 (likely pre-split; it had a 2:1 split in 2023), your adjusted entry might be lower. It\u2019s a steady, low-risk pick with monopoly-like traits. Recent additions to your portfolio suggest confidence in its growth\u2014check trading volumes and new account additions.\n\n8. **KFin Technologies Ltd**  \n   - **60 shares @ \u20b9852** (Recent addition)  \n   - **Cost**: \u20b951,120  \n   - **Sector**: Financial Services (RTA)  \n   - **Thoughts**: KFintech, a registrar and transfer agency, is a niche player riding the mutual fund and capital market boom. \u20b9852 is a bold entry, but JP Morgan\u2019s top pick status (X post) aligns with its growth story. It\u2019s a small but high-conviction position\u2014monitor its client additions and profitability.\n\n9. **Sona BLW Precision Forgings Ltd**  \n   - **50 shares @ \u20b9714**  \n   - **Cost**: \u20b935,700  \n   - **Sector**: Auto Components/EV  \n   - **Thoughts**: Sona BLW is well-positioned for the EV transition with its driveline components. \u20b9714 is reasonable if bought before its recent EV-driven rally. Auto ancillary stocks can be volatile with OEM demand\u2014check order wins and EV exposure.\n\n10. **AAVAS Financiers Ltd**  \n    - **20 shares @ \u20b91,454**  \n    - **Cost**: \u20b929,080  \n    - **Sector**: Housing Finance  \n    - **Thoughts**: AAVAS targets affordable housing, a resilient segment. At \u20b91,454, your entry is moderate, but NBFCs have faced interest rate sensitivity. Its small allocation limits its impact on your portfolio\u2014review asset quality and loan growth.\n\n11. **NTPC Green Energy Ltd**  \n    - **138 shares @ \u20b9108** (IPO)  \n    - **Cost**: \u20b914,904  \n    - **Sector**: Renewable Energy  \n    - **Thoughts**: NTPC Green\u2019s IPO listing in November 2024 was hyped, but your \u201c\ud83d\ude29\u201d suggests it\u2019s underwater (possibly trading below \u20b9108). Renewable energy is a long-term theme, but IPOs can be volatile initially. Hold on\u2014NTPC\u2019s backing and India\u2019s green push could drive recovery.\n\n#### Risk Factors\n- **Concentration**: VBL (21% of invested capital) and Clean Science (15%) dominate your portfolio. A dip in either could amplify losses.\n- **Volatility**: Jiofin, NTPC Green, and Laurus Labs are higher-risk bets due to evolving businesses or market sentiment.\n- **Market Context**: Indian stocks faced a four-month losing streak into January 2025 (Reuters), suggesting broader pressure. Your 5% loss is moderate in this backdrop.",

        "selftext": "New Delhi, Jan 10 (PTI) Investors' wealth tumbled Rs 12 lakh crore in three days of market slump due to uninterrupted foreign fund outflows and concerns over quarterly earnings.\n\nAlso, rising crude oil prices and a strengthening dollar index added to investors' pessimism.\n\nIn three days, the BSE benchmark Sensex tanked 820.2 points or 1.04 per cent.\n\nOn Friday, the 30-share BSE benchmark declined 241.30 points or 0.31 per cent to settle at 77,378.91. During the day, the benchmark gyrated 820.15 points between the day's high of 77,919.70 and low of 77,099.55.\n\nThe NSE Nifty dropped 95 points or 0.40 per cent to 23,431.50.\n\nThe market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms diminished by Rs 12,07,314.99 crore to Rs 4,29,67,835.05 crore (USD 5 trillion) in the three days.\n\nFrom the 30-share blue-chip pack on Friday, Indusind Bank, NTPC, UltraTech Cement, State Bank of India, Sun Pharma, Axis Bank, Tata Steel and Power Grid were among the major laggards.\n\nTata Consultancy Services jumped nearly 6 per cent after the IT services company reported an 11.95 per cent surge in the December quarter net profit to Rs 12,380 crore.\n\nDevarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities, said, \"Strong quarterly earnings from TCS drove the IT index up 3.4 per cent, helping the market withstand a sharp sell-off.\"\n\nHowever, despite broad gains across IT stocks, the Nifty fell for the third consecutive session, Vakil added.\n\nTech Mahindra, HCL Tech, Infosys and Bajaj Finserv were the\n\nother big gainers.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth Rs 7,170.87 crore on Thursday, according to exchange data.\n\n\"Domestic market sentiment remained subdued due to rising crude oil prices, driven by supply concerns, and a strengthening dollar index. Despite the IT sector's resilience following positive early Q3 results, broader indices bled due to uncertainties surrounding Trump policies and high valuations.\n\n\"Consolidation may persist in the near term, yet investors are closely watching the US non-farm payroll data today for further guidance, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.\n\nThe BSE smallcap gauge dropped 2.40 per cent and midcap index declined 2.13 per cent.\n\nAmong BSE sectoral indices, power tanked 3.07 per cent, utilities (2.86 per cent), realty (2.64 per cent), industrials (2.08 per cent), commodities (2.05 per cent) and consumer durables (1.98 per cent).\n\nBSE Focused IT jumped 3.17 per cent, IT (2.65 per cent) and teck (2.24 per cent) were the biggest gainers.\n\nAs many as 3,167 stocks declined while 827 advanced and 84 remained unchanged on the BSE.\n\n\"Markets continued its downward trajectory as the rupee dropping to new lows against the strengthening dollar has further dampened investors' sentiment. Amid concerns of subdued economic growth and expectations of a slowdown in the quarterly earnings, investors cut their bet on banking and mid & small cap stocks.",

The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.\n\nAdditionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance.",

I might add more if the correction is steep. \n\nTaMo is facing competitive intensity, but has done well so far, and has a good launch pipeline. The industry is struggling, so stay vigilant, and monitor sales, discounting, inventory levels, and competition. I'll put it on rank 2. Don't plan to add, and have gradually reduced my exposure by half in the last few months. \n\nZomato has growth, but for every unit of growth, it has 10 units of hype. And valuations are retarded.

        "selftext": "**1. Company fundamentals**\n\nNTPC Green Energy Limited is owned by NTPC Limited. It is India's largest power generation company. The company has a lot of positives such as:\n\n**Strong Parentage:**\u00a0Company is backed by NTPC Limited, a state-owned enterprise, which provides NTPC Green with financial stability and access to resources.\n\n**Company Growth:**\u00a0NTPC Green Energy has seen a revenue growth rate of 46.82%, increasing from \u20b9910.42 crore in FY 2022 to \u20b91,962.60 crore in FY 2024. The profit after tax has been growing at a CAGR of 90.75%, increasing from \u20b994.74 crore in FY 2022 to \u20b9344.72 crore in FY 2024.\n\n**Government Support:**\u00a0The Indian government's emphasis on renewable energy and\u00a0policies such as 24x7 power for all, Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, PLI schemes and multiple green energy schemes can benefit NTPC Green.\n\n2.\u00a0**Issue size and split**\n\nThe size of the\u00a0IPO is Rs. 10000 crore and the\u00a0minimum investment is Rs. 14,904 for retail investors.\n\nThe NTPC Green Energy IPO is a\u00a0**purely fresh issue**, meaning there is\u00a0**no Offer For Sale (OFS)**\u00a0component.\u00a0This is a huge green flag since we know that all proceeds from the IPO will go directly to the company and will not be cashed out by existing promoters.\n\n3.\u00a0**Brand name and experienced Management**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the company is a subsidiary of state-owned NTPC Ltd. The key management team is experienced and has good expertise in the power sector.\n\nThe management is led by CEO Mr. Rajiv Gupta, CFO Mr. Neeraj Sharma and company secretary Mr. Manish Kumar.\n\n4.\u00a0**Valuation**\n\nNTPC Green is aiming for a valuation of around $12 billion, which is one of the biggest valuations in the renewable energy sector.\n\nThe company's PE ratio of 260 is higher than its bigger competitor Adani Green Energy's PE ratio of 173. But the valuation can be considered reasonable, given the company's strong fundamentals, growth prospects, and the government's push for renewable energy.\n\n5.\u00a0**Clear Use of Proceeds**\n\nThe\u00a0company proposes to use the proceeds from the IPO towards investment in the wholly-owned subsidiary, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (NREL), for repay\u00a0debts of subsidiary NTPC Renewable Energy and the remaining for general corporate purposes.\n\nWhile this may raise questions among investors, repayment of debts also comes with positives such as reduced loans, reduce in interest outflow for company and increase in profits after tax (PAT).\n\n6.\u00a0**Strong underwriting team**\n\nReputable underwriters or investment banks backing the IPO signal credibility and thorough due diligence.\n\nThe book-running lead managers or underwriters to the issue are\u00a0IDBI Capital Market Services Limited, HDFC Bank Limited, IIFL Securities Ltd and Nuvama Wealth Management Limited. The issue's registrar is Kfin Technologies Limited.\n\n7.\u00a0**QIB subscription**\n\nWhen the big players are subscribing in the beginning, without coming the last moment for filling the QIB quota, we can believing that QIBs are genuinely interested in the IPO and company. So observe the QIB subscription numbers throughout all 3 days of the IPO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nThis IPO is mostly positive, you can invest money according to your risk appetite or wait until the day of listing if at all you feel that the listing is about to happen at a discounted price.",

The stock closed at 366.70 today which is almost 17% down from 440 (ATH) which it achieved on 30 September 2024.\n\nMy question now is what are the reasons for NTPC stock going down? \nWill it be a good buy for long term if it goes down even further (<350). Should it be bought then?",

The stock has broken its support level and closed below it, signaling a bearish sentiment. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.\n\nAdditionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance.",

        "title": "Top 10 Indian Company News - 2025-04-24",
        "selftext": "Here's a summary of the top 10 most important news items concerning Indian publicly listed companies from today's exchange circulars:\n\n1.  **Jubilant Agri:** Ordered by the High Court of Karnataka to deposit \u20b94 Crore by June 9, 2025, in an ongoing dispute with Shivashakthi Builders. This deposit is a condition for staying a money decree of \u20b98 Crore awarded to Shivashakthi Builders. This event has a potential to negatively affect the fundamentals of the company.\n\n2.  **Suzlon Energy:** Secured a 378 MW wind energy project order from NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL). Suzlon will supply 120 S144 Wind Turbine Generators (WTG) for a project in Karnataka. This order reinforces Suzlon's position in India's renewable energy transition.\n\n3.  **Orient Cement & Ambuja Cements:** Rukmani Birla Educational Society, Shri Jagannath Educational Institute, Shri Venkateshwara Educational Institute, Sri Govinddeo Educational Institute, Calcutta Hospital Institute, Calcutta Medical Institute, Shri Lakshminarayan Educational Institute and Shri Hari Om Educational Institute sold their stakes in Orient Cement to Ambuja Cements via off-market transfers. Ambuja Cements acquired a total of 9.97% stake in Orient Cement from these educational institutes.\n\n4.  **Tata Communications:** Incorporated a new wholly-owned step-down subsidiary in China, 'TC (Shanghai) Network Services Company Limited', to provide telecommunications and digital services. This expansion allows Tata Communications to directly cater to the growing demand in China.\n\n5.  **Tata Communications:** Stake in its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, NetFoundry Inc., diluted from 100% to 11.49% after NetFoundry Inc. secured funding through the issuance of new shares to venture capital firms SYN Ventures & LDV Partners. This will directly affect the revenue of Tata Communications due to reduced ownership.\n\n6.  **Aurobindo Pharma:** Eugia Pharma Specialities Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary, received USFDA approval for Dasatinib Tablets, targeting a $1.8 billion market. This approval allows Caplin Steriles to enter this market, potentially increasing revenue and profitability.\n\n7.  **Apollo Pipes:** Allotted 2,000,000 Fully Convertible Warrants to KITARA PIIN 2401, a non-promoter entity, at Rs. 550 per warrant. This allotment will increase the company's paid-up equity share capital to Rs. 46,04,82,060 on a fully diluted basis. This increase in equity base is likely to affect the earnings per share of the company.\n\n8.  **Lupin Diagnostics:** Achieved 100% NABL accreditation across all its greenfield labs. This accreditation should improve the revenue of the company as more patients and doctors are likely to prefer the services of the company.\n\n9.  **Optiemus Infracom:** Optiemus Unmanned Systems (OUS), a wholly-owned subsidiary, launched four new advanced drones for defense, surveillance, and reconnaissance and partnered with Taiwan-based Avix Technology. This development is likely to positively impact the company's revenue streams by expanding its product portfolio and tapping into the growing demand for indigenous defense solutions.\n\n10. **Rajesh Power Services:** Secured new orders worth \u20b91,116 Crores from government and institutional clients for power transmission and distribution projects in Gujarat. This significant order inflow is expected to positively impact Rajesh Power Services' revenue stream.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is based on exchange circulars submitted by companies on NSE and BSE as of 2025-04-24 and is intended for informational purposes only.
