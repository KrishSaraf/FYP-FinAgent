I\u2019ve worked hard to support my family and am currently responsible for my parents and others close to me. At 28, Single and working full-time, I started investing around 2-3 years ago with no prior experience, learning through Reddit, YouTube, and books.\n\nMy focus is on long-term growth, with a goal of reaching 1cr before I turn 30. Achieving this would provide me with a sense of financial security and peace of mind.\n\nTreat me someone who is eager to learn but lacking good network or friends to guide me through these decisions. Your advice would mean a lot to me.\n\nCurrent status of my monthly investment :\n\n* Nifty 50 SIP - Monthly (20k) \n* Nifty next 50 SIP - Monthly (20k) \n* Additional stocks investment - (10k)\n\nSpecifically, I would appreciate your thou/ghts on the following:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e16bz91ij9rd1.png?width=2396&format=png&auto=webp&s=4334e3b3534e987a3f6dfd43a79276fe249d52dd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vlwt7e1ij9rd1.png?width=1910&format=png&auto=webp&s=f136b5c1c098fed073443b724f031b77f6cb83c4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4oh9dc1ij9rd1.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1b772a3e523dd79b61e5aac351ff972f6b3c7da\n\n1. How do you eval/uate my current port/folio, and what improvements could I make?\n2. What actions or strategies should I focus on to potentially reach 1cr before 30? Additionally, how much more investment would be necessary to achieve that goal, currently investing around \\~50/month?\n3. I will be receiving a bonus of approximately 8L next month, what would be the best strategy to invest it wisely?\n\nThank you for your time and expertise. Happy to hear your thou/ghts on how I can improve my approach and avoid common mistakes :)",

With a portfolio already at \u20b940 lakhs, you would need to invest about \u20b92 lakh per month via SIP to meet your financial goals.\n\nI suggest you avoid chasing higher returns by taking unnecessary risks, like investing in penny stocks or derivatives for short-term gains. These can lead to significant losses over time. Instead, focus on consistently growing your capital. Regular investments in mutual funds, combined with a little exposure to stocks (if you understand them), can be a more sustainable way to create wealth. Aim for a 15-16% CAGR as your target rather than running after speculative returns.",

        "selftext": "[This portfolio has a story better than Pushpa 2 lol. So half of the stocks were suggested by a random dude on instagram and idk how but 99&#37; of the time, his suggestions were spot on. Apparently he was part of a trading company. I made crazy gains thru him, but I deleted my instagram account out of some personal reasons. After that I decided to start my own research and few of the stocks are result of my research. My first bet was Zomato which went really really well. So instead of consolidating the existing companies, I started buying new shares. I agree this was a dumb decision. Then I got busy in my exams and didn't have much time to research. So I bought shares just on the company's name. Some of these shares are Mahindra Logistics, Paras, Exide Industries, TVS Supply Chain and others. As you can see, most of them did decently well. Then I applied for Hyundai IPO with\u00a0literally zero research. I thought since it's a big IPO of a big company, it'll eventually go up. I know, again a dumb decision, but here we are. Now the problem is, I can't figure out which ones to hold and which one to sell. As of now, I don't have time to research all of them. I will start studying finance & stock market soon, as it is included in my syllabus, but it'll start after 4-5 months. Until then I wanted a starting point regarding my portfolio. Those who have experience, what are the immediate red flags you've noticed? What suggestions do you have for me?\\(other than to learn stock market lol\\) Also, this is just 66&#37; of my total portfolio. The rest 34&#37; is in mutual funds with XIRR of 20.40&#37;. The total portfolio's XIRR is 22.05&#37;. Any input would be highly appreciated.

                "body": "Hi man, good you have invested and made returns too. Here are some suggestions from my side, don't be disheartened or offended. I am giving these in your best interest only and since I've gone through this phase i can probably give more sensible advice  \n1- Ncc- it's a okay share. ROE on lower side, but main thing is what theme are you betting on. You mentioned you are bullish on infra. From past experiences it is seen that during bull markets infra, real estate shares make highs and do well but during bear markets everyone forget such shares. This theme has never fascinated my personally, and I do not fall for this theory that \"India ko develop hona hai toh infra toh badhega hi\" that is a hollow statement and many imp stats are ignored while saying this. Still if you have studied the theme enough and bullish on it then keep up with it. Other financial ratios seem to be fine in this share.   \n2- HCLTech - Large cap IT. In IT space I can divide it like two categories. Extremely large cap big companies and some emerging small cap or mid cap IT space. Personally if I am coming to markets i want to make more than usual returns. Large cap ITs have grown significantly and I do not see them growing 16-18 percent, although i would want more than 20% growth returns. So I always look for mid cap ITs not even small cap because that makes it more risky. So general suggestion, until unless you are too hinged on hcltech you can look for mid cap, see where their operations are what are their services? do this before rate cuts starts because that will give boost to the company's financials in the coming quarters. \n\n3- Tata steel - You might not like my opinion but reaching 400 in five years is not a big achievement (& is not even guaranteed). Thing is it is highly cyclical stock. Even tata steel mgmt doesn't know what steel prices they would be addressing in next quarter because a lot of volatility is there in such sectors due to geopolitical reasons and much more. Tata mgmt is amazing but business essentially is not good and once the downtrend starts then you will be stuck at one price for long and even the mgmt can't do much if external forces are not in their favor. So in long run you are minimizing your returns if you keep ur money in this stock. All my answers are in assumption of you should be making at least 18-20% returns every year (not just one year)\n\n4-Ambuja Cement- why are you so hinged on infra and building materials? If you see you are keeping such low ROE businesses that automatically will reduce your returns. ROE is an important ratio, ideally it should be above 18% and if cash light business is there like IT then above 25%   \n\n\n5- Bought the best banking stock. You got it at right levels so cant say much. Not a bad investment and can make good returns \n\n  \n6-  Sula - Ideally not a good sector to invest, and even if you are then you should keep sectoral leaders. These sectors are not something which will observe huge demands all of sudden, understand this. Buying small cap shares makes sense when the sector is in huge demand. UB was much better choice. And if you asked me I would say you should invest in proper consumption stock rather than this. \n\n7- IRFC - another low ROE business. Seems like you got it by hearing its name in news or x. I mean you can invest but again from long term if you are here to make good returns then focus should be on right sectors, high roe business. \n\n8- Goldbees - I do not invest in bees personally and I have a neutral view on it. \n\nOverall your returns are less not just from one year view but I can see your future pf trajectory. I know you are not open to make changes but you should make changes at this level to improve your pf for the future.\n\nGeneral advice\n\n1- Do not be in love with any share/company. We do have our favourites where we think we are gonna make money, company is good. But we cannot be fixated. We are here to make money and not keep the loving company even if we are losing money. \n\n2- Always be in search for better ideas/themes. I think your pf is more towards low roe business, more infra related and if infra theme fails then this pf will give less returns. Try to think of other themes. I urge you to research on consumption stocks because in long run consumption shares can give 20-25% returns. Technology shares and financial shares can do the same. \n\nI hope I did not offend you but I gave an honest view as if you were my younger brother. Keep growing and learning and happy investing. Im ready to ans further questions if u got any",

This innovation positions Tata Steel as a key player in India\u2019s green energy transition and could have long-term positive implications for the company\u2019s growth and market positioning.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Tata Steel\u2019s stock is currently in a downtrend, trading below its support trendline and the 40-week EMA. However, it is now resting on a critical Fibonacci golden zone, a level often associated with potential reversals. This zone also coincides with the 40-month EMA, adding further significance to this support level. Historically, such confluence zones have acted as strong areas for price reversals or consolidation.\n\nThe news of Tata Steel\u2019s hydrogen transport pipes could serve as a fundamental catalyst to complement this technical setup. If market sentiment turns positive on this development, it could potentially reignite buying interest and help the stock resume an uptrend. However, investors should remain cautious and monitor price action closely, as broader market conditions and sectoral trends will also play a role in determining the stock\u2019s direction.",

        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

Both the monthly and weekly trends are bearish. However, the secondary trend, which reflects the movement on smaller timeframes, is currently positive, suggesting that the stock is experiencing a pullback.  \nOn the hourly chart, the stock has broken down below its support trendline, accompanied by an RMI sell signal. This indicates that the pullback might be over and the stock could resume its downtrend.  \nAdditionally, the 40-hour EMA and the 20-hour SMA of the Bollinger Bands are positioned near the breakdown area. If the stock closes below both the 40-hour EMA at level of 129.5 and the 20-hour SMA of the Bollinger Bands at level 130, it would further confirm the continuation of the downtrend.",

        "selftext": "I have created this portfolio over the period of last 4 years, barring 1-2 stocks. Over the time, with suggestions from friends, and other advice, the stock count has grown considerably. Total of 87 scripts.\n\n* Some came from smallcase (invested in 1 about 3 yrs back, didn't add more)\n* Other reasons to add - own analysis, sectoral growth, blue chip big name etc.\n\n  \nYou will also see some smaller investments in this, as and when with whatever amount I could manage. Thankfully, they have turned out well, but can't brag about these returns as investment was very small ! And then there are some troubled ones, I dunno if I should average them.\n\nI am looking to clean up this list considerably, and infuse fresh money.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pl3xw6e1wlld1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=eabb2f7ef7fe8226d9bd0da21bf7e3d61dd747ef\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ryvtwcd3wlld1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5480580ea7179725c1055fcc375d1f848f5cd8f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rzpgrtd3wlld1.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6aeadff32f684452c4a847370f9d92c2fa5eeb7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lua2lfd3wlld1.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f8189dcf38f84fc4f57cdd4ae9f5b12c9dea648\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4reifcd3wlld1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d23aa149b72613cb3e628387ad5a927e7084fc1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjpnycd3wlld1.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3382da99926a9733a51d25b3c2d788acb39a129\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vn5v9g3wlld1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee9bc84d9b78696b43cdf72f4f85a90bd811d306\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2fhvcd3wlld1.png?width=872&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c83b6c8172ed583f2632bf8d1d9b278ea9503f0\n\n",

I usually wait for my stocks to hit a certain price before I take out the principal amount and the profit remains invested in the stock itself. I try to choose stocks with good fundamentals and have not consistently invested in a stock because I may not have the patience for it right now and also my capital is limited. I know no. of stocks are greater compared to the capital invested but some of my bets take more time to give returns and some are impulse decisions that I intend to cut down.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ld9hhon6nn7d1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c5879dcb970cdd0a5cf39ce40e3e0540a471655\n\nPlease give your valuable suggestions regarding the portfolio and the strategy I use. I am directing all my monthly savings to mutual funds as of now and have stopped putting any money directly in equity.",

Everyone starts somewhere, don't be discouraged when you see huge amounts being invested here and there subs. \n\nSecondly, you have got some good stock picks there, but try to pick stocks based on your own knowledge and analysis. Don't pay attention to social media hype or tips and recommendations. And as the amount is small dont over diversify stocks, selling those 1 quantity stocks will result in charges and brokerges fees more.\n\nLast but not least, i think you are quiet young, dont invest anymore in individual stock picks now m start a mutual fund instead, like a  Index fund. Keep investing there and, side by side, study how the stock market works more thoroughly. Stock market is a very volatile place, you can gain wealth and lost wealth in the same day hence this advice will suit you for now.",

My target is I want to recover all my loss first so I am doing some short term buying and selling like here u can see I have bought paytm last week I will sell it on 1000. Then suzlon which made me cry for a Year now and it went up on 72 something and falling from 3 days now I have decided I will sell it on 71 and finally I will exit from share market and will restart fresh.\n\nAlso u can see I am 8k up but as u know I said I am 6k in loss I can immediately exit. What I have decided is i will keep zomato for long term. May be sell it around or above 300.\n",

This innovation positions Tata Steel as a key player in India\u2019s green energy transition and could have long-term positive implications for the company\u2019s growth and market positioning.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Tata Steel\u2019s stock is currently in a downtrend, trading below its support trendline and the 40-week EMA. However, it is now resting on a critical Fibonacci golden zone, a level often associated with potential reversals. This zone also coincides with the 40-month EMA, adding further significance to this support level. Historically, such confluence zones have acted as strong areas for price reversals or consolidation.\n\nThe news of Tata Steel\u2019s hydrogen transport pipes could serve as a fundamental catalyst to complement this technical setup. If market sentiment turns positive on this development, it could potentially reignite buying interest and help the stock resume an uptrend. However, investors should remain cautious and monitor price action closely, as broader market conditions and sectoral trends will also play a role in determining the stock\u2019s direction.",

Both the monthly and weekly trends are bearish. However, the secondary trend, which reflects the movement on smaller timeframes, is currently positive, suggesting that the stock is experiencing a pullback.  \nOn the hourly chart, the stock has broken down below its support trendline, accompanied by an RMI sell signal. This indicates that the pullback might be over and the stock could resume its downtrend.  \nAdditionally, the 40-hour EMA and the 20-hour SMA of the Bollinger Bands are positioned near the breakdown area. If the stock closes below both the 40-hour EMA at level of 129.5 and the 20-hour SMA of the Bollinger Bands at level 130, it would further confirm the continuation of the downtrend.",

        "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/wzth1tpj2xfe1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e99d205462a2ea9bc6f3cee0e900f7560d2bca8a\n\nTata Steel has achieved a groundbreaking milestone by becoming India\u2019s first company to develop hydrogen transport pipes, a significant leap in the clean energy sector. This innovation positions Tata Steel as a key player in India\u2019s green energy transition and could have long-term positive implications for the company\u2019s growth and market positioning.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Tata Steel\u2019s stock is currently in a downtrend, trading below its support trendline and the 40-week EMA. However, it is now resting on a critical Fibonacci golden zone, a level often associated with potential reversals. This zone also coincides with the 40-month EMA, adding further significance to this support level. Historically, such confluence zones have acted as strong areas for price reversals or consolidation.\n\nThe news of Tata Steel\u2019s hydrogen transport pipes could serve as a fundamental catalyst to complement this technical setup. If market sentiment turns positive on this development, it could potentially reignite buying interest and help the stock resume an uptrend. However, investors should remain cautious and monitor price action closely, as broader market conditions and sectoral trends will also play a role in determining the stock\u2019s direction.",

Both the monthly and weekly trends are bearish. However, the secondary trend, which reflects the movement on smaller timeframes, is currently positive, suggesting that the stock is experiencing a pullback.  \nOn the hourly chart, the stock has broken down below its support trendline, accompanied by an RMI sell signal. This indicates that the pullback might be over and the stock could resume its downtrend.  \nAdditionally, the 40-hour EMA and the 20-hour SMA of the Bollinger Bands are positioned near the breakdown area. If the stock closes below both the 40-hour EMA at level of 129.5 and the 20-hour SMA of the Bollinger Bands at level 130, it would further confirm the continuation of the downtrend.",

Is it worth to keep juggling between both app knowing that I will only invest in one of these apps i.e Zehroda in this case. \nNovice here, who was at a look out for market getting a hit before I invest back in 2022. Fortunately, the opportunity came with the war.\nNow looking at this, portfolio, I understand that it\u2019s not an easy money and requires patience and commitment. There was an initial period where even these tanked to -20% but I never panic sold any one.\n",
