Thanks to OP. \n\nComing to the question, I think we may be missing out on some things, but what I know is, getting debt to fund their expansion plans and business is more easier, otherwise billionaires like Mukesh Ambani, Sunil Mittal, etc, won't be taking so much debt.\n\nAlso, just see the interest payment on those debt by these companies VS the profit they earn annually. I think that maybe making some sense also in paying debt rather than using reserves.\n\nThat is all I know and can say on this. Maybe some good in economics or accounts here in this subreddit can give more clear answer on this.",

        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

Suppose on the monthly expiry day of Airtel ..it closes at 1456 and you choose is 1400 ce strike price then that 1400 ce option will close at 56 rs . And extrinsic value is calculated on the basis of option greeks that is whole different science ..greeks are the only factor which makes price to change continuously! So yaha ki baat kre !

Recently, friends advised that having too many MF SIPs can be problematic. They mentioned that the investment amount shouldn't change, but the number of MFs should be fewer. I didn't fully understand this. Are they right? If so, why? Also, if I need to reduce the number of MFs, which SIPs should I keep and which should I let go?\n\n2. **Should I invest less in SIPs and more in stocks?**\n\nI'm 29, and my friends say my risk appetite is higher. However, I prefer long-term investments and don't have the time or expertise to buy/sell stocks regularly. Am I making a mistake by focusing more on SIPs? Should I allocate more to stocks?\n\n3. **Should I consider an SWP?**\n\n4. I have 10 lacs to invest now. Any suggestions on how to allocate this based on my current portfolio?\n\nSorry for the many questions, but I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!",

                "body": "1. Yeah I think you have way too many MF's. You can reduce it to 4-5 funds max. Please check the overlap between the different funds. I don't think multiple ELSS Tax Saver funds are required. Just keep 1 from each category. The reason for not keeping multiple MF's is, different expense ratios can keep eating into your profits.\n2. If you don't have time to analyse and buy/sell stocks, you can continue with your SIP, no problem in that. You mentioned that you are picking stocks based on your friend's suggestions, and that can go horribly wrong. It's your life and your financial goals, so you can take the call about which way you want to go. Nothing wrong with either.",

I would probably suggest others to invest in safe stocks like airtel instead of high risk ones but probably my experience is too low to even suggest others things . Is this portfolio good ,if I am planning to hold it for maybe 2 years ? I am just a class 12th student and dont need to earn a huge amount of money right now , I just wanna learn these stuffs. ",

Also there was quite a nice move to the upside near 3 pm yesterday. So i expected a break out move today and my risk was only 500 in this case.\n\nAs i expected it brokeout from that level.\nToday market opening was lil confusing and tricky till afternoon soo i booked 650 profit.\n\n\nAnd also in the case of AXISBANK. I had bullish view but i noticed some serious selling in axis bank at the beginning of market open so i book a small loss. But afternoon it moved upside \n\nAnd another trade was in BRIGADE ENT. I noticed some big buying in that stock and with my setup i took a trade. It moved in my favour(1.5x r/r) but i didnt booked profit expecting it to rally because market was in fire mode!! But end of the day also i noticed another big buying at the same level.and the move didnt happened yet. Expecting it to happen on monday. I will wait for my set up. Letsee\n\nAnyway my netloss for today after tax and brockerage is -17\n\nHow did your trades end today??",

Separately, of course, I have a personal equity portfolio as well \u2014 in that, I have been investing ~40% of my capital based on momentum factor for the past couple of years and that has beat the broader market indices by a decent margin. \n\nBeginning today, in this thread, I\u2019ll post top 10 stocks from Nifty50 which are currently experiencing high momentum. I\u2019ll update this list on a weekly basis. \n\nIf I see interest in these lists, I\u2019ll post high momentum stocks from small- and mid-caps as well. I have a couple of smallcases as well (freely available) that are also based on momentum tracking. These have given 79% and 20% returns in the past 14 months and 4 months, respectively. \n\nDisclaimer: THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE. I\u2019M NOT A SEBI REGISTERED ENTITY. I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE PERSONAL POSITIONS IN SOME OF THESE STOCKS. THIS IS ALL FOR EDUCATIONAL DISCUSSION ONLY.",

When iv contracts tomorrow, your overall position will lose value more than 20000 taking conservative estimates of iv drop. That means your breakeven point will be 20 points on the upside from 1830 and 110 on the downside. So you only make a bit of money if Airtel moves up by 1.5% or down by 6.5%. With this quarterly results that\u2019s not going to happen in 1 day period.\nAnd if you look at the oi data it seems highly improbable that Airtel goes above 1900.\nJust book your loss when market opens.

Also there was quite a nice move to the upside near 3 pm yesterday. So i expected a break out move today and my risk was only 500 in this case.\n\nAs i expected it brokeout from that level.\nToday market opening was lil confusing and tricky till afternoon soo i booked 650 profit.\n\n\nAnd also in the case of AXISBANK. I had bullish view but i noticed some serious selling in axis bank at the beginning of market open so i book a small loss. But afternoon it moved upside \n\nAnd another trade was in BRIGADE ENT. I noticed some big buying in that stock and with my setup i took a trade. It moved in my favour(1.5x r/r) but i didnt booked profit expecting it to rally because market was in fire mode!! But end of the day also i noticed another big buying at the same level.and the move didnt happened yet. Expecting it to happen on monday. I will wait for my set up. Letsee\n\nAnyway my netloss for today after tax and brockerage is -17\n\nHow did your trades end today??",

The weekly RMI is signaling a new buy opportunity.

As thumb rule naked option buying should be ok but IV and IVR reading is best way to determine that.  When confused buy spreads.  Want to play safe? Buy spread.  Spread never hurts.  \n\nOption trading requires you to be right on three things at same time - direction of move, time of move and volatility.  Hence spreads are better.  If you know / can predict these three factors with reasonable accuracy ONLY then think of naked option buying.  Naked option selling NEVER PERIOD.\n\nEdit:  I don\u2019t know what all analysis tools you use.  If you do not have payoff graph then I will strongly advice you to open trading account with Dhan.  They have options trader or something which comes with account.  Use that to calculate options payoff.  Using dhan for trading is your wish but this tool is free and excellent for payoffs etc.",
