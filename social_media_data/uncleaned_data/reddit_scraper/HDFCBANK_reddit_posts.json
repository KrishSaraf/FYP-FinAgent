When the tide turns, the rally would be very sharp\" now it needs to be taken with a pinch of salt but the next thing he said is Travel and Tourism industry will outperform for this year which was not surprising because even a layman can realise the way Indians are splurging on Travelling and hotels it is nothing that the industry has ever witnessed so far I believe these small factors and the larger picture that we're still striving, improving, developing unlike the countries that are reaching saturation keeps my bullish view intact. We have a lot of room left for improvements, overhauling in the banking, roads, infrastructure, consumerism so it'll always be the fastest growing sectors. On the side note Imo ITC hotels will outperform in the next few quarters and potentially can see an upside of 30-40% in the short term. Despite all of this there is anxiety, fear at times and the big \"What if the markets don't recover\" in those moments I get reminded of the fact that we've been improving every year and there is this exponential growth in retailer investments sentiment which will only further fuel the rise of our Markets.",

Most of that came from just one or two days where we lost control emotionally, and that\u2019s what this tool is trying to prevent.\n\nRight now it connects to Zerodha through the API. You enter your API keys and generate a session token each morning \u2014 after that, it watches your positions and applies the risk limits you\u2019ve set.\n\nI\u2019m still writing up the documentation, but if you\u2019re interested, I can share it with you once it's ready.

HDFC Bank: Biggest private sector bank with a focus on retail and growing in Tier-2/3 cities. We are 1 stock market crash away from HDFC Bank rallying. Irony?\n2. Angel One: Growing the second fastest in brokers. Fairly valued as compared to Groww but overvalued as compare to Zerodha. Reference Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gb1r0m/want\\_to\\_go\\_yolo\\_on\\_angel\\_one/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gb1r0m/want_to_go_yolo_on_angel_one/)\n3. INFY/HCL/Wipro: Most of my positions are more than 2 years old. Now, you can call it Betting on Trump\n4. IRFC: Got lucky. Bought at a decent valuation when the stock was 25. Sold 1/3 position at 125 and still hold the remaining 2/3 of the position. Will let it play out because if India needs to move at scale, railways need to be better and more common. Railways get their funding from IRFC.\n5. Amara Raja: Betting on a reputed battery company with the most reliable battery brand (Amron). Bought it at decent valuations around 2 years back\n6. Divis/Dr. Reddy/NH/Lal Pathlabs: Consumer companies in an economy where focus on healthcare is expected to grow\n\nIf you want my reasons for any other stock, just comment. \n\nIn which stocks do you think I can increase my position? For which stocks you think the reward outweigh the risk? Share your thoughts in the comments below. We can discuss and can make/save money together $$",

I'm slowly moving my inv from Axis ELSS to PP ELSS (as and when 3 year limit ends), so count one less fund. The two PP funds again I count as basically one big Flexi fund, so that's again one less fund.

                "body": "Hi man, good you have invested and made returns too. Here are some suggestions from my side, don't be disheartened or offended. I am giving these in your best interest only and since I've gone through this phase i can probably give more sensible advice  \n1- Ncc- it's a okay share. ROE on lower side, but main thing is what theme are you betting on. You mentioned you are bullish on infra. From past experiences it is seen that during bull markets infra, real estate shares make highs and do well but during bear markets everyone forget such shares. This theme has never fascinated my personally, and I do not fall for this theory that \"India ko develop hona hai toh infra toh badhega hi\" that is a hollow statement and many imp stats are ignored while saying this. Still if you have studied the theme enough and bullish on it then keep up with it. Other financial ratios seem to be fine in this share.   \n2- HCLTech - Large cap IT. In IT space I can divide it like two categories. Extremely large cap big companies and some emerging small cap or mid cap IT space. Personally if I am coming to markets i want to make more than usual returns. Large cap ITs have grown significantly and I do not see them growing 16-18 percent, although i would want more than 20% growth returns. So I always look for mid cap ITs not even small cap because that makes it more risky. So general suggestion, until unless you are too hinged on hcltech you can look for mid cap, see where their operations are what are their services? do this before rate cuts starts because that will give boost to the company's financials in the coming quarters. \n\n3- Tata steel - You might not like my opinion but reaching 400 in five years is not a big achievement (& is not even guaranteed). Thing is it is highly cyclical stock. Even tata steel mgmt doesn't know what steel prices they would be addressing in next quarter because a lot of volatility is there in such sectors due to geopolitical reasons and much more. Tata mgmt is amazing but business essentially is not good and once the downtrend starts then you will be stuck at one price for long and even the mgmt can't do much if external forces are not in their favor. So in long run you are minimizing your returns if you keep ur money in this stock. All my answers are in assumption of you should be making at least 18-20% returns every year (not just one year)\n\n4-Ambuja Cement- why are you so hinged on infra and building materials? If you see you are keeping such low ROE businesses that automatically will reduce your returns. ROE is an important ratio, ideally it should be above 18% and if cash light business is there like IT then above 25%   \n\n\n5- Bought the best banking stock. You got it at right levels so cant say much. Not a bad investment and can make good returns \n\n  \n6-  Sula - Ideally not a good sector to invest, and even if you are then you should keep sectoral leaders. These sectors are not something which will observe huge demands all of sudden, understand this. Buying small cap shares makes sense when the sector is in huge demand. UB was much better choice. And if you asked me I would say you should invest in proper consumption stock rather than this. \n\n7- IRFC - another low ROE business. Seems like you got it by hearing its name in news or x. I mean you can invest but again from long term if you are here to make good returns then focus should be on right sectors, high roe business. \n\n8- Goldbees - I do not invest in bees personally and I have a neutral view on it. \n\nOverall your returns are less not just from one year view but I can see your future pf trajectory. I know you are not open to make changes but you should make changes at this level to improve your pf for the future.\n\nGeneral advice\n\n1- Do not be in love with any share/company. We do have our favourites where we think we are gonna make money, company is good. But we cannot be fixated. We are here to make money and not keep the loving company even if we are losing money. \n\n2- Always be in search for better ideas/themes. I think your pf is more towards low roe business, more infra related and if infra theme fails then this pf will give less returns. Try to think of other themes. I urge you to research on consumption stocks because in long run consumption shares can give 20-25% returns. Technology shares and financial shares can do the same. \n\nI hope I did not offend you but I gave an honest view as if you were my younger brother. Keep growing and learning and happy investing. Im ready to ans further questions if u got any",

This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

        "selftext": "The Indian equity markets took another hit on **January 6, 2025**, with the **Nifty 50** plunging **1.6%** (over 400 points) to **23,601.50**, and the **BSE Sensex** plummeting **1.6%** (over 1,200 points) to **77,959.95**.\n\n#### What's Behind the Sell-Off?\n- **#HMPV Virus Scare**: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) detected two cases of the **Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV)** in Karnataka. This has spooked investors, adding to the market's woes.\n- **Continued #FII Selling**: Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have sold over **\u20b94,500 crore** in January, with concerns over current valuations making Indian markets less attractive.\n- **#HDFCBank's Slow Loan Growth**: HDFC Bank reported a **15.8% year-on-year growth in deposits**, but only a **3% growth in loans**, causing its stock to fall by **2.2%** to **\u20b91,710.60**.\n\n#### Expert Opinions\n- **Deepak Jasani** from HDFC Securities highlighted that the **#FII selling** is a bigger concern than the HMPV cases.\n- **V K Vijayakumar** from Geojit Financial Services mentioned that **urban demand** is not as weak as feared, and resilient domestic segments might support the market.\n- **Prashanth Tapse** from Mehta Equities pointed out that **earnings updates** and **Trump's dialogue** post his January 20 inauguration will be key market drivers.\n\n#### Looking Ahead\nThe market's direction will depend on upcoming **#Q3Earnings** and **Trump's policy decisions**. Investors are advised to stay cautious and watch for any positive cues from earnings updates and global developments.\n\n### Hashtags\n#MarketCrash #HMPV #FII #HDFCBank #Nifty50 #Sensex #Investing #StockMarket #Economy #Finance #Trump2025",

I am 41 and doent have any liabilities, house is paid for, not interested in owning a car right now (If I will, I'll buy with cash) to add to this I have a year of expenses saved asside as emergency funds plus a PPF account which matures next year.\n\nI am also fortunate to inherit my parents folio which is currently at 1.8c with 82% of it coming from 12 stocks and it has a total of 65 stocks which were bought almost a decade back and has not been managed since. It just compounded over time. Note: Dad retired from L&T thus 33% which I need to trim. This along with my folio is for my retirement and plan to keep it long term 15+ yrs\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mg3jz8r3uidd1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=cca951302023d0a072154bc82731ce0a95ec7e05\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4gh57p4uidd1.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3a284b216e5846392ef584cb3f1c334cb441ead\n\nNow I am considering if I should go with a PMS (some options are Liquide black/Kedia securities. I am also checking for one of my aqquitances who manages PMS and is a ex Axis bank employee used to manage HNIs\n\nTalk about Liquide they charge currently have a flat structure of 30k annually and provides a 360 approach to investing including tax planning. They will have around 10 custom stocks and plan to deploy funds over 2 weeks in the market. I was a bit concerned about it but they said they are taking money from equity and reinvesting into other stocks so not really a risk persay. Also folio will be managed by me 100% they just act as advisory.\n\nOver the years I feel it is better to have specialists working (like a team of yours) that makes life easier. I'll be happy if I can get a 17%-18% CAGR and peaceful sleep\n\nYour thoughts please.. I'm sharing snapshot of my folio (from Zerodha) and parents folio (excel) so you have a fair idea on how I have performed (everyone has performed in the bull market \ud83d\ude01)\n\nYour recommendations are really appreciated, Thank You :)",

                "body": "One simple thing. You can't hold stocks for long on someone's suggestions, you will start to doubt yourself and advisory in a bear market. Understand the market, pick undervalued, growing, quality stocks, invest and forget. Your stock picking skills are good IMO. Just hold for long. No advisory will come in help if COVID or 2008 crash repeats, you are most likely to sell those in panic and due to lack of understanding the business. \u263a\ufe0f I'm not much qualified to advice, still I have heard these from my father. He was approached by a PMS manager, but luckily he got away from it. Now he holds many 10-20-30-40+ baggers. I'm more focused towards studying and picking growing smallcaps in value zone. Anyways PMS won't help in any market. Check historic returns of popular PMFs. Compare it with an index fund. You will yourself beat them if you have conviction on business and hold.

                "body": "For a portfolio exceeding \u20b91 crore, a PMS (Portfolio Management Service) is often a wise choice. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Professional Expertise**: PMS ensures active monitoring and management by experts with a dedicated research team.\n2. **Better Returns**: With the right firm, you can expect consistent returns, often exceeding 15% CAGR over the long term (5+ years).\n3. **Peace of Mind**: Delegating your portfolio management reduces stress and lets you focus on other priorities.\n\n**My Recommendations**:  \nAvoid smaller players like Liquide. Instead, consider reputed firms like **360One** and **Alchemy Capital**. Both have a proven track record and are trusted by many HNIs, including several of my own clients who are extremely happy with the performance and stability of their PMS investments.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you\u2019d like more insights or need guidance regarding PMS options!",

Don\u2019t worry about taxes now tbh since your capital is safe. \nStart with any good mutual fund if you know how to analyse them or get an advisor or just stick to investing in nifty 50 index funds or ETFs monthly and forget it till you need your capital or retirement.",

        "selftext": "Hi, I was looking for a tool which can track all news related to stocks in realtime from various sources at one place. I could not find any such tool. Used moneycontrol portal and forum for tracking various news and chatter related to a particular stock but it has become super annoying due to ADs every 10-15 sec. So, I have built a simple tracker. What it does is:\n\n* It tracks several sources like, ET, BS, News Portals etc.\n* Stock wise news notifications / section\n* Can be used as a forum for discussion about a particular stock\n\nCurrently, it solves my purpose of accessing all news related to a stock at one place. But, I want to develop it further and add more sources / information. Can also add stock specific information like various technical indicators, chart patterns, bulk deal etc.\n\nIt would be great if few of you guys can use it and let me know if it is useful and what improvements can be made in it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vw4ivzunhpad1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c7860187f46922dd34adb664de498c3b22ceb2a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pnjrszunhpad1.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dffa1bfd73cd3ae1bbf85a0ac85fcb1aa1d7aa4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2a8cq01phpad1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77ee71bff7f42f19cc4057f995b1222cdd689d69\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nsuwzq2phpad1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79f4158b07b4a8982fb8aaf02a620db23dfd116f\n\n",

HDFCBANK, ITC)?\n\nThesis - These are stable businesses run by professionals, already beaten down due to slower growth, if bulls continue, these stocks might get a re-rating and in case bears take over, with the current valuations there is a limited downside.\n\nAdditionally, sell 10-20% of holdings as OTM calls based on monthly outlook, if stock falls, you earn premiums, if it rises, you earn limited profit. Use that money in building position on cheaper stocks.\n\nThoughts?",

Recently, friends advised that having too many MF SIPs can be problematic. They mentioned that the investment amount shouldn't change, but the number of MFs should be fewer. I didn't fully understand this. Are they right? If so, why? Also, if I need to reduce the number of MFs, which SIPs should I keep and which should I let go?\n\n2. **Should I invest less in SIPs and more in stocks?**\n\nI'm 29, and my friends say my risk appetite is higher. However, I prefer long-term investments and don't have the time or expertise to buy/sell stocks regularly. Am I making a mistake by focusing more on SIPs? Should I allocate more to stocks?\n\n3. **Should I consider an SWP?**\n\n4. I have 10 lacs to invest now. Any suggestions on how to allocate this based on my current portfolio?\n\nSorry for the many questions, but I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!",

                "body": "1. Yeah I think you have way too many MF's. You can reduce it to 4-5 funds max. Please check the overlap between the different funds. I don't think multiple ELSS Tax Saver funds are required. Just keep 1 from each category. The reason for not keeping multiple MF's is, different expense ratios can keep eating into your profits.\n2. If you don't have time to analyse and buy/sell stocks, you can continue with your SIP, no problem in that. You mentioned that you are picking stocks based on your friend's suggestions, and that can go horribly wrong. It's your life and your financial goals, so you can take the call about which way you want to go. Nothing wrong with either.",

Today when I was checking the analytics section in my stock broker (Zerodha), all these ETF's are categorized as \"Debt\". Should I be worried about it?\n\nI know individual stocks like HDFCBank, INFY, TCS etc... are all taxed at 12.5% (LTCG). Is the same applies for NiftyBees, ITBees and Pharmabees as well?\n\nAlso, why does NSE official website show Niftybees, Bankbees under Debt category?\u00a0[https://www.nseindia.com/products-services/etfs-debt](https://www.nseindia.com/products-services/etfs-debt)\n\nAre we screwed here or good? does Nima thai make changes to nse sites directly? haha :)",

Also this was lump sum, and the funds were also of my choice. \n\nAlso as per my father's advice, as he used to do is save a target sum for a year and invest in mutual funds lump sum when the market plummets. Do this once or twice in a year rather than SIP.\n\nBut still I have started one SIP in MLO defence index fund, cause I missed the defence and railway stocks rally.",

Also, I would suggest not get into sectors like PSUs and defence based on momentum. Certain sectors will make lot of move then crash then settle down in certain levels for a long time.\n\nIf your purpose with defence fund investment is to capture momentum in certain pockets of the market, I would suggest to go for factor based indices, my personal suggestions would be Nifty200 momentum 30 and nifty 500 value 50, combination of these two factors would yield you good returns over long term, as when one factor doesn't shine, the other does. You can also swap out momentum 30 with Nifty midcap 150 momentum 50 if you bear little more volatility.\n\nIf you want to capture momentum in sectors via aggressive sector rotation there is Edelweiss business cycle fund which aggressively changes sector allocation based on factors like momentum, value etc.\n\nAlso, my advice would be that instead of allocating small percent allocation to sectoral or thematics, you could give large allocation to these factors indices.\n\n\nOther than, your portfolio is better than 95% of the stuff I see on here. Continue investing, you should see good gains over the long term, be patient and stay invested",

Again, not a Covid investor myself, but the assumption that risks are necessary for market-beating rewards is not a sane theory. You can, and should, aim to beat the markets at your ideal risk appetite, and then compare the risk-reward against your beta when benchmarking. This is, in essence, the efficient market hypothesis.\n\n2. Red and green hota rehta hai. Good that you're enjoying tropical paradise abhi, and congrats on the same. But Bees is just a basket of stocks, and nothing more than that. It's not inherently bad, it's like trading on an index-linked ETF when you don't have a clear picture about the constituents, but like the theme. Sure, individual components within a basket of stocks will definitely overperform the average, but it also protects you from underperformance.\n\nChill, mate. Katti cancel, ab bicchi?",

Basis experience so far in the markets, can't find value anywhere currently. Holding 2.5L in cash for any correction.\n\nRight move at this point seems to diversify away from equities. However, overall debt portfolio also is sizeable and it doesn't seem wise to add to it considering taxes and inflation. Hence have zeroed down on land or real estate as the next investment vehicle. However, ticket size is huge, which is why I feel I am caught in a long waiting game.\n\nMedium term strategy for equities is to keep building the cash position waiting for prices to cool down (US elections, interest rate move maybe) and to build a safety shell around equity portfolio so that it needn't be touched and can keep growing at whatever rate.\n\nThoughts? Anyone else thinking similarly?",

        "selftext": "India's cultural affinity for gold has led to an estimated 25,000 tonnes of the precious metal being held by households and temples, often lying idle in lockers and vaults.\n\n[tianjindaxuexuebao.com](https://tianjindaxuexuebao.com/dashboard/uploads/8.%204V2ZJ.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)This vast reserve, if effectively mobilized, presents a significant opportunity to bolster our economy and strengthen the Indian Rupee (INR).\n\n\n\n**The Economic Impact of Idle Gold:**\n\n* **Current Account Deficit (CAD):** India is one of the world's largest importers of gold. This high volume of imports contributes substantially to the CAD, exerting pressure on the INR.[tianjindaxuexuebao.com](https://tianjindaxuexuebao.com/dashboard/uploads/8.%204V2ZJ.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Currency Depreciation:** A higher CAD often leads to the depreciation of the INR against major currencies, affecting the country's purchasing power and economic stability.[policybazaar.com](https://www.policybazaar.com/gold-rate/articles/how-gold-affects-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Proposed Solution: Gold Monetization and Specialized Loan Schemes**\n\nTo mitigate these challenges, we should encourage the infusion of idle gold into the economy. The government and financial institutions can play a pivotal role by:\n\n1. **Enhancing Gold Monetization Schemes (GMS):** The GMS, introduced in 2015, aims to mobilize idle gold by allowing individuals and institutions to deposit gold with banks in exchange for interest earnings. However, its uptake has been limited due to various factors, including lack of awareness and concerns about the safety and returns.[tianjindaxuexuebao.com](https://tianjindaxuexuebao.com/dashboard/uploads/8.%204V2ZJ.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n2. **Introducing Specialized Gold-Backed Loan Products:** Banks can develop loan products that offer favorable terms to individuals and businesses willing to pledge their gold holdings. This approach can:\n   * **Provide Liquidity:** Enable gold holders to access funds without selling their assets.\n   * **Reduce Gold Imports:** Satisfy domestic demand through recycled gold, thereby decreasing the need for imports.\n   * **Strengthen the INR:** Lower gold imports can help reduce the CAD, contributing to a stronger INR.\n\n**Current Banking Initiatives:**\n\nSeveral banks have initiated gold loan schemes to provide liquidity against gold assets. For instance:\n\n* **ICICI Bank:** Offers gold loans with interest rates starting from 9.25%, allowing loans up to \u20b92 crore with flexible repayment options.[icicibank.com](https://www.icicibank.com/personal-banking/loans/gold-loan?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **State Bank of India (SBI):** Provides personal gold loans with interest rates starting from 8.50% per annum, catering to various financial needs.[sbi.co.in](https://www.sbi.co.in/web/personal-banking/loans/gold-loan?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **HDFC Bank:** Offers quick disbursal of gold loans with competitive interest rates and flexible tenure options.[hdfcbank.com](https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/borrow/loan-against-assets/gold-loan?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy effectively mobilizing idle gold through enhanced monetization schemes and specialized loan products, we can reduce our dependence on gold imports, lower the CAD, and work towards strengthening the INR. It's imperative for policymakers, financial institutions, and citizens to collaborate in this endeavor to harness the economic potential of our gold reserves.\n\n*Note: The information provided is based on available data and aims to present a perspective on leveraging gold assets to strengthen the Indian economy.*",
