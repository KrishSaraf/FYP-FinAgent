Mint\u2019s take, on the other hand, seems more optimistic.\n\nSo, what's the truth? And more importantly \u2014 **why do business media outlets present such different narratives using the same numbers?**",

News will always be inconsistent just because of the sheer amount of data they can put out and the way they interpret them. \n\n\nRevenues, Net and gross profits, ebit margins, ebitda and this can be QoQ or YoY just as an example. Consolidated statements standalone statements. Natcopharma missed estimates yesterday and expects a bad year ahead but most news organisations read profits up revenue up etc etc when in reality their margins contracted quite a bit. \n\n\nJust an example. Do your due diligence and don't rely on news for result interpretation cause they just want more viewership and will misrepresent information to gain it.",

        "selftext": "\n\n**Business**  \n  \nOla Electric, established in 2017, founded by Bhavish Agarwal of Ola Cabs, **is the largest manufacturer of EV 2 wheelers in India**. They manufacture EVs and certain core EV components like battery packs, motors and vehicle frames at the Ola Futurefactory. Ola commenced delivery of their first EV model, the Ola S1 Pro, in December 2021. They are a pure EV company and their R&D and technology including in-house design, engineering, manufacturing, are all singularly focused on building EV products. In August 2023, Ola also announced a line-up of motorcycles comprising four models.  \n  \nThe Ola Futurefactory is the largest integrated and automated E2W manufacturing plant in India in terms of production capacity **(** **total installed capacity of 6.79 lakh per annum)** They have R &D facilities in India, UK and the US. Ola Electric manufactures EVs and certain core EV components like battery packs, motors and vehicle frames at the Ola Futurefactory. They are also building EV hub in Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts in Tamil Nadu, which is expected to span up to 2,000 acres of land, and includes Ola Futurefactory, **upcoming Ola Gigafactory for cell manufacturing in Krishnagiri district** and co-located suppliers in Krishnagiri district. Their products Ola S1 Air and S1 Pro ( Gen2) are eligible under PLI incentive scheme where they will get 13-18% of sales value.  \n  \n**Network**\n\n  \nThey operates own direct-to-customer (D2C) omnichannel distribution network across India, comprising **870 experience centres and 431 service centres** (of which 429 service centres are located within experience centres).  \n  \n**R&D**\n\n  \nTheir R&D and technology platform consists of the following technologies which are interconnected: (a) software, including in-house developed operating system, MoveOS, (b) electronics, (c) motor and drivetrain, (d) cells and battery packs and (e) manufacturing technology. **There are 959 employees in R&D**, total employees 7369, on roll 4011. Employee attrition at 44%.  \nOla currently sources cell from outside vendors. Ola is developing cell manufacturing capacity in Ola Gigafactory which will make them independent in terms of cell manufacturing. **Ola has 88 registered patents and 217 patent applications pending in India.**  \n  \n\n\n**Finance**\n\n  \nOla facilitates financing through one of their Group Companies, Ola Financial Services Private Limited (OFSPL) and in partnership with 12 financial institutions that offer loan tenures of up to five years. **53% of Ola vehicles are financed through OFSPL**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cyfiy9f68agd1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaaaf0b9e2170dea28d03fd5f26bf6aa0b13d9fb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o1bshmc78agd1.jpg?width=727&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ad44acd80c6e4780e6d7eb954f332973fc33d43\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n**Products**  \n  \nOla Electric has 7 models  \n  \n**Scooters**  \n  \n-S1 Pro  \n-S1 Air  \n-S1 X+  \n-S1 X ( 2 KWh)  \n-S1 X ( 3 KWh)  \n-S1 X ( 4 KWh)  \n  \n**Motorcycles** ( upcoming in H1 FY26)  \n  \n-Diamondhead  \n-Roadster  \n-Adventure  \n-Cruiser  \n\n\n**Warranty**\n\nOla offers a **standard warranty of three years/40,000 km** (whichever is earlier) on battery and EV scooter components and a standard warranty of eight years/80,000 km (whichever is earlier) on battery packs.  \n  \n**Technology**  \n  \nIn January , 2024, Ola Electric officially launched MoveOS version 4, which includes various new features such as navigation powered by Ola Maps , call filter, \u2018find my scooter\u2019, geofencing, time fencing, anti-theft alert, fall detection, hill hold, auto turn-off indicators, ride journal and energy insights. Ola EV scooters are connected to their network and designed to transmit data through our vehicle telematics systems, which enables us to continually enhance our product features and performance.  \n  \n**87% of the components used in three EV scooter models, the Ola S1 Pro, the Ola S1 Air, the Ola S1 X+ are common across all three models.** For example, the Ola S1 Pro, the Ola S1 Air and the Ola S1 X+ use the same battery pack. Modular and adaptable nature of platform architecture will help to drive down costs and enable Ola to achieve fast product development cycles, thereby reducing time to market. Most of the components are sourced from Indian suppliers.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7clzwpo98agd1.jpg?width=766&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b711c0c91cc1bcca9f434c251fa800eb1ba3279f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ds0jh9fa8agd1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8b0f97b958cfafb3c0d5b99297b84dd1f5eb73a\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij8h939b8agd1.jpg?width=815&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fa164378387f7ae03d7cd9c1b6b3cfdebae8c22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Industry overview**  \n  \n  \nIndia is a global production hub for two-wheelers \u2013 **a total of \\~19.5 Mn 2W were produced in India in FY 2023 contributing 15-20% of the world\u2019s total 2W production, making it the second largest 2W producer in the world after China**. Of the total production, \\~4 Mn units were exported. **16-17 Mn units were sold domestically**. Globally, India is the second largest 2W market in terms of domestic sales volumes. Value of 2W domestic market size in India was Rs 1.4-1.6 Tn (US$17-20 Bn) in FY 2023. The TAM for 2W export from India is between Rs 7-8 Lakh cr. Markets like Africa, South East Asia provide an export opportunity for Indian OEM\u2019s which further increases their TAM with an **export opportunity of around 100 million unit globally.**  \n  \n**E2W penetration in India is expected to expand from approximately 5.4%** ( China 85-90%) of domestic 2W registrations sales in Fiscal 2024 **to 41-56% of the domestic 2W** sales volume by Fiscal 2028, according to the Redseer Report. EVs have lower total cost of ownership (TCO) vs ICE vehicles, for e.g., electric two wheelers (that have led EV adoption in India) **have \\~55% lower TCO vs their ICE counterparts** over the life of the vehicle. This is driven by lower fuel costs (roughly 1/10th of ICE) and other savings on vehicle spends (maintenance, registration subsidies)  \n  \nHigh fuel prices and the resulting total cost of ownership (TCO) have limited **2W penetration to \\~160 2Ws per \u2018000 people in India in CY 2022**, which is much lower than some of the SEA countries ( China 300-350, Indonesia 450-470), suggesting a large headroom for 2W growth ahead. Industry is projected to grow at 11% CAGR for next 5 years.  \n  \n**Premiumization trend**  \n  \nSegment share of entry level motorcycles have drastically reduced since FY20. Premium motorcycles and scooters are being sold more, as evident from segment share diagram.  \n  \nMultiple factors are pushing the personal mobility demand towards 2Ws:  \n  \na. Need for affordable personal mobility  \nb. Current state of road transport infrastructure  \nc. Strong supply  \nd. Last-mile mobility  \n  \nAffordable price segments dominate both scooters and motorcycles (including mopeds), with **86% and 82% of sales volumes respectively in less than Rs 1 lakh.**  \n\n\n**Policies support for EV 2 wheelers**  \n  \n**Production-linked Incentive (PLI) Schemes \u2013** In 2020, the government launched PLI scheme to boost domestic manufacturing, cut down import bills, encourage exports and generate employment. These incentives are linked to incremental sales of new-age technology products manufactured domestically.  \n**Automobiles and auto components sector (budget: Rs 25900cr )**- The PLI proposes financial incentives of up to 18% (sales-linked) to boost domestic manufacturing of AAT products (min. 50% domestic value addition will be required) and attract investments. This scheme will be applicable from FY 2024 for a total of five consecutive financial years.  \n  \n**Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery (budget: Rs18100cr) Scheme** was launched for setting up ACC Battery Storage manufacturing facilities in India, with a total manufacturing capacity of 50 Giga Watt- hour (GWh) for 5 years.  \n  \n**India Semiconductor Mission 2021 (budget: \u20b9 76000)**, included various schemes (such as semiconductor fabrication, display fabrication, compound semiconductor & semiconductor assembly, testing, making & packaging, and design-linked incentive).  \n  \n**Faster Adoption and Manufacturing (of Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME)**  \nSubsidy phase I ( budget 900cr) was launched between FY15 and FY19 , phase II was launched between FY20 and FY24 ( Budget 10000cr)\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vo66wbc8agd1.jpg?width=731&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1631df17b8e1d8cff9e01b6c78ba472f8cb3ef5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfxnllxc8agd1.jpg?width=706&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51e200d22419bead8f187be017e41b053c138472\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2z532nrd8agd1.jpg?width=691&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=251fa27518628dac16a8022def284db9c625d396\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/weczgpie8agd1.jpg?width=715&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b46c6c2a0d801cc5295c00537708b396ef0c7106\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n**Operating metrics**  \n  \n**Ola Electric has sold 14393 scooters in FY22, 152500 scooters in FY23 and 328940 scooters in FY24.**  \n  \n**R&D cost for FY24 is 385cr comprising 7% of revenues**. Total R & D spends for last 3 FY is 1067cr. **37% of parts are imported, rest indigenized.** Ola primarily imported supplies such as lithium-ion cell, magnets, amplifier, electronic integrated circuits, from China, South korea. **Top 10 suppliers supplied 60% of parts.**  \n  \nIn Segment share of scooters in the industry has increased from 21% in FY13 to 34% in FY24 and has stabilized in 32-34% range.  \n  \n**Ola electric leads the industry with EV market share of 35%**, TVS motors 19.5%, Ather energy 11.2%, Bajaj auto 10.9%.  \nEBITDA margins for Bajaj Auto 21.7%, TVS 14.3%, Hero 15.7%, Eicher 33%\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bt6o0erf8agd1.jpg?width=648&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2650ce342121ebd726847ccf184abb9d97a9b67\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n**Financials**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/640h6wqg8agd1.jpg?width=731&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=861ef2b6b73d8101632c4b9dc3c80bdb162e997c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18r6jjlh8agd1.jpg?width=743&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48cf89241d1a13e934935cbcfb8b7bad823ea3f8\n\n  \nTotal revenue from operations 5010cr in FY24 .

Once they do, they might end up sweeping the market share from Ola Electric.**  \n  \n**Plus dealers of Ola electric won't survive selling only a few EVs, unit economics won' t permit that. In such a situation, network expansion, especially to Tier 2/3 cities ( where volumes are low) will be a challenge.**  \n  \nR&D and product development constitute 7.7% and 19.3% of revenues for FY24 and FY23 respectively.\u00a0  \n  \nFAME II subsidies have been scaled down from 40% to 15% in Jun '23 , following which there was temporary drop in sales which recovered by festive season. In future, introducing such subsidies may play a pivotal role in EV 2wheeler sales.  \n  \nOla plans to import 2 key components in cell manufacturing ( CAM and AAM) from China, which might face problems due to geopolitical issues in future.  \n  \n**Ola electric has 4 e-scooter models which constituted 98% of revenues in FY24, which is definitely a concentration risk.**  \n  \nOla Electric is relatively new having 3 years experience in market, so they might face some issues which are unsolvable. ( provided they don't have any technology partner to guide). Plus due to lack of historic data, they may face problem of inventory management wrt variants and colours. They are trying to develop in-house cell manufacturing capabilities which, if faces issues will cause loss of product reputation in market.  \n  \n37% of parts are imported from suppliers outside India. Top 10 suppliers supplied 60% of parts.\u00a0  \n  \nEmployee attrition rates of 44% is too abnormal, needs to be looked into with caution.  \n  \nProfitability of Ola depends on availing PLI incentive schemes from GOI.  \n  \nCapacity utilisation of Ola electric stands at 49% in FY24, which affects its profitability and hinders from achieving economies of scale.  \n  \nOla has related party transactions to the tune of 25% of revenues, one must dig deeper into those before investing.  \n  \nBattery cost being 30% of vehicle cost, if battery life is poor then Ola scooters will earn bad reputation in market ( full cycle of battery is yet to be seen in most vehicles).  \n  \n  \n**Valuation**  \n  \nOla electric is valued at P/S of 6.69, whereas TVS at 3.11, Eicher at 7.87, Hero at 2.79, Bajaj at 5.82. PE ratio wise TVS\u00a0 74, Bajaj 34, Eicher 32, Hero 28.\n\n\n\n",

                "body": "Tata Motors unlike Maruti and Bajaj is a global brand considering its business Jaguar Land Rover being approximately 60% of its revenue share, JLR revenue have recently been slumped and facing many problems. Even though the local passenger vehicle segment has high growth potential and been doing well recently it\u2019s not a significant part of Tata motors.  Also historically Tata motors have been having high result fluctuations with high debt it is definitely on the lower end of the PE ratio compared to Maruti. \nAlthough I believe tata motors can overcome these problems in the longterm and we could see a PE spike afterwards. Market is currently undervaluing to a certain extent. \nThis is just my understanding of the situation.",

As of FYTD25, penetration stands at 5.8%. EV growth has been ~30-35%.\n\n99% of volumes are in EV scooters and EV penetration in scooters is ~16%.\n\n\nEV is an evolving market, with material market share shifts every month. We use a 3M moving average to arrive at market share and it is a better reflection of prospective market share.\n\nAs of December. Ola is the largest E2W followed by TVS, Bajaj, Ather and Hero.\n\n\nHonda\u2019s Activa and Suzuki\u2019s E-Access deliveries in the next few months will result in market share moderation for all the above peers.\n\nHow has FY25 been for 2 wheelers and where are they placed ?\n\n2W have been the fastest growing sector in FY25 so far, seeing ~10.6% growth till December 2024. 2 wheelers are set for the second highest volumes delivered ever.\n\n\nSuzuki and Honda has been the fastest growing domestic company growing over 29% / 23% YTD followed by TVS at 13.6%.\n\nThe scooter portfolio of the incumbents continues to materially outgrow the bikes portfolio.\n\nBajaj, Hero and Eicher volumes have been in the 6-8% growth rate.\n\n\nThere are pockets where each of the companies are placed which can benefit them, broad one liner for where each company is placed and what can help them grow faster.\n\nHero MotoCorp -\n\nWhat\u2019s happening - Hero has been continuously losing market share due to a weak EV and Scooter portfolio , 125-250CC and entry level 100 CC not doing well due to stress in rural economy.\n\nWhen can Hero Outperform - If Rural recovery is sharp and faster than Urban recovery and if Hero(+Ather) continues to hold material market share in the EV segment.\n\nTVS Motors -\n\nWhat\u2019s happening - TVS has been continuously garnering market share due to a strong Scooter and 125-250 CC portfolio.\n\nWhen can TVS underperform - TVS Portfolio is at the highest risk of electrification (~61% of volumes in Scooters and Mopeds) resulting in probable material market share loss. EV market share is a key monitorable.\n\nBajaj Auto -\n\nWhat\u2019s happening -\n\nBajaj has been growing in-line with market owing to a decent 125-250 CC portfolio.\n\nHowever, Bajaj Auto derives ~40% of exports from 2&3W and exports have been under pressure.\n\nWhen can Bajaj Auto outperform -\n\nStrong recovery in Africa and South Asia primarily Nigeria, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other countries.\n\nBajaj\u2019s EV market share is rapidly increasing and if they are to maintain the same in long run\n\n3W portfolio contributes ~15% of volumes, Strong 3W performance can help Bajaj Auto.\n\nEicher Motors -\n\nWhat\u2019s happening -\n\nEicher Motors has been losing market share as >250CC market has seen increased competitive intensity from Bajaj Triumph and Hero with Harley Davidson.\n\nWhen can Eicher outperform -\n\nEicher\u2019s ability to stay ahead of the curve in innovation and garnering market share in >250 CC and premium bikes\n\nExports growing materially faster (currently only 9% of volumes)\n\nOla - Ola\u2019s success or failure will be determined by EV market share\n\nOther listed players\n\nGreaves Electric Mobility - Ampere\n\nRattan India Enterprises - Revolt\n\nWardWizard Innovation - Joy E-bikes\n\nConclusion - Broadly 2W is the best performing sub-segment in FY25 so far and is expected to be the fastest growing segment in FY25.\n\nFor the full article which includes some charts kindly refer to -  https://cashcows.substack.com/p/all-you-need-to-know-1-automobile",

M&M has overtaken Tata Motors to be the largest LCV player in India.\n\n\nE-CV\u2019s -\n\nECV\u2019s have the lowest penetration at 0.4%, the only sub-segment which has grown faster has been E-bus due to government bus and E-bus penetration has been higher than E-4 W.\n\n\nHow has the year been for CV\u2019s in FY25 so far ?\n\n\nCV has seen a de-growth of 1% for first 9M, and most companies expects similiar performance in Q4.\n\nLCV\u2019s has de-grown by 3% whereas MHCV\u2019s have been flat.\n\n\n\nAshok Leyland - Benefits largely on account of strong MHCV Cycle\n\nTata CV - (will list on stock markets soon post demerger of Tata Motors) - Benefits from strong MHCV and LCV cycle.\n\nMahindra - Benefits largely on account of strong MHCV Cycle\n\nVECV - Benefits largely on account of Strong MHCV cycle. VECV is ~15% for Eicher Motors.\n\nOlectra Greentech - Can benefit disproportionately if E-bus penetration increases materially and companies garner higher incremental market share\n\nSML Isuzu - Bus portfolio doing well\n\nForce Motors - Benefits largely on account of strong LCV cycle and particular categories such as ambulances.\n\nShare\n\n3 W -\n\n3 wheeler Indian market is ~20000-22000 crore market with domestic 3 wheeler market being ~15000 crores and Export market is ~7500 crores.\n\n3 wheelers are primarily goods and passenger rickshaws. Bajaj Auto is the largest player in India, followed by Piaggio and Mahindra. 3 wheeler volumes are 7% below it\u2019s all time high volumes in 2020.\n\n\nBajaj Auto is the largest 3W player in the country followed by Piaggio and Mahindra. Other smaller players include Atul Auto and TVS domestic\n\n\nEV -\n\n3W has the highest EV penetration with ~15.6% on conventional 3W. If you include low voltage E-3W, (found in Delhi / Jaipur among other cities) EV penetration is already a ~56%\n\n\nThere are a lot E-3 W companies who have raised private capital (below list with last round valuation) and may get listed in the future\n\n\u2022 Mahindra LMM - ~6600 crores\n\n\u2022 Altigreen Propulsion system - ~2500 crores\n\n\u2022 Euler Motors - ~1300 crores\n\n\u2022Atul Greentech \u2013 983 crores\n\nHow has 3 W performed -\n\n3W growth has been decent at 6% for first 9M.\n\n\nCompanies and exposure to 3W -\n\nAtul Auto is the only pure-play 3 W listed player currently.\n\nBajaj Auto and TVS derives ~15% / 5% of revenues from 3W.\n\n\n\nConclusion - Broadly CV has seen de-growth in FY25 so far, No material outliers have been identified across segments in CV. Growth in CV\u2019s is likely to be muted over the near future. Interest rate cut can materially aid CV cycle.\n\nBroadly, there are 6 listed CV players which can disproportionately benefit depending on CV scenario.\n\n 3W market evolution is a great primer for how auto-sector will evolve in electrification over the next few years and a lot of opportunities will develop and evolve in 3W space.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

It\u2019s been a bit of a mixed bag lately, with some sectors holding strong while others dip. Here\u2019s the lowdown:\n\n# \ud83d\udcca Today\u2019s Market Vibe\n\n* **NIFTY 50**: Ended at **24,399.40**, down a smidge **0.15%** (-36.10 points).\n* **SENSEX**: Slightly dipped to **80,065.16**, down **0.02%** (-16.82 points).\n* **NIFTY BANK**: Showed some muscle, closing up **0.57%** at **51,531.15**.\n* **NIFTY IT**: Dropped by **0.19%** (closed at **42,139.85**).\n* Sector-wise, most indexes did alright on October 28, with PSU Banks and Metals leading the way.\n\n# \ud83d\ude80 Top Movers to Watch\n\n**Top Gainers:**\n\n* **Shriram Finance** popped up by **5.39%**! Other big gainers include **Adani Enterprises**, **ICICI Bank**, and **Wipro**.\n\n**Top Losers:**\n\n* **Coal India** took a hit, down **4.22%**, and companies like Bajaj Auto and Axis Bank also slid a bit.\n\n# \ud83e\uddd0 Market Trends\n\nThe market had a nice little rebound on October 28 after a rough five-day losing streak, with strong buying in banking and metal sectors. But, heads up! NIFTY is nearing a resistance level at **24,500**, so things could get interesting.\n\n# \ud83c\udf0f Economy Check-In\n\nWhile the market\u2019s looking okay for now, analysts are hinting at possible bumps ahead\u2014high valuations and slowing earnings growth could spell some trouble. Earnings downgrades might be lurking around the corner.\n\n# \ud83c\udf89 What\u2019s Next?\n\n* **Muhurat Trading**: A special Muhurat Trading session for Diwali! A lot of people see it as a good time to kick off new investments, so we might see some added action.\n* **Upcoming Holiday**: Markets will be closed on **November 1** for Diwali (Laxmi Pujan).\n* **Big Earnings on Deck**: Tech and banking giants are dropping their earnings reports this week, so we\u2019ll see if they shake things up.\n\n# \ud83d\udcad Final Thoughts\n\nThe market\u2019s got a \u201cwait and see\u201d vibe right now. With Diwali trades, holiday closures, and earnings reports all lined up, it\u2019s a good time to keep an eye on sector-specific plays.",

        "selftext": "Hi, I was looking for a tool which can track all news related to stocks in realtime from various sources at one place. I could not find any such tool. Used moneycontrol portal and forum for tracking various news and chatter related to a particular stock but it has become super annoying due to ADs every 10-15 sec. So, I have built a simple tracker. What it does is:\n\n* It tracks several sources like, ET, BS, News Portals etc.\n* Stock wise news notifications / section\n* Can be used as a forum for discussion about a particular stock\n\nCurrently, it solves my purpose of accessing all news related to a stock at one place. But, I want to develop it further and add more sources / information. Can also add stock specific information like various technical indicators, chart patterns, bulk deal etc.\n\nIt would be great if few of you guys can use it and let me know if it is useful and what improvements can be made in it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vw4ivzunhpad1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c7860187f46922dd34adb664de498c3b22ceb2a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pnjrszunhpad1.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dffa1bfd73cd3ae1bbf85a0ac85fcb1aa1d7aa4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2a8cq01phpad1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77ee71bff7f42f19cc4057f995b1222cdd689d69\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nsuwzq2phpad1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79f4158b07b4a8982fb8aaf02a620db23dfd116f\n\n",

        "selftext": "Commercial Vehicles (CV\u2019s) -\n\nCV\u2019s are broadly classified into Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV\u2019s) and Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicles (MHCV\u2019s).\n\nLCVs include vans, pickup trucks, and small delivery trucks, while MHCVs include large tractor-trailers, dump trucks, and heavy-duty delivery trucks.\n\nBroadly CV market is ~2,00,000 crores market with MHCV is ~1,30,000 crore market whereas LCV\u2019s being ~70000 crores market.\n\nBoth MHCV and LCV are ~5% and ~3% lower than peak levels.\n\n\n\nMHCV Market Share -\n\nMHCV is a larger segment with 3 large players, Tata Motors (~47% MS), Ashok Leyland (~31%) )and Volvo-Eicher CV (~8.2%).\n\nMHCV have smaller players in sub-segments such as SML Isuzu (buses), Mahindra, Olectra Greentech and JBM Auto (e-buses)\n\nTata Motors over past 10 years has lost ~800 bps primarily to Ashok Leyland and VECV (~600 and ~200 bps respectively)\n\n\nLCV\u2019s on the other hand has 2 large players i.e Mahindra (~43% MS) and Tata Motors (~34% MS), with Ashok Leyland and Force Motors being the smaller players. M&M has overtaken Tata Motors to be the largest LCV player in India.\n\n\nE-CV\u2019s -\n\nECV\u2019s have the lowest penetration at 0.4%, the only sub-segment which has grown faster has been E-bus due to government bus and E-bus penetration has been higher than E-4 W.\n\n\nHow has the year been for CV\u2019s in FY25 so far ?\n\n\nCV has seen a de-growth of 1% for first 9M, and most companies expects similiar performance in Q4.\n\nLCV\u2019s has de-grown by 3% whereas MHCV\u2019s have been flat.\n\n\n\nAshok Leyland - Benefits largely on account of strong MHCV Cycle\n\nTata CV - (will list on stock markets soon post demerger of Tata Motors) - Benefits from strong MHCV and LCV cycle.\n\nMahindra - Benefits largely on account of strong MHCV Cycle\n\nVECV - Benefits largely on account of Strong MHCV cycle. VECV is ~15% for Eicher Motors.\n\nJBM Auto and Olectra Greentech - Can benefit disproportionately if E-bus penetration increases materially and companies garner higher incremental market share\n\nSML Isuzu - Bus portfolio doing well\n\nForce Motors - Benefits largely on account of strong LCV cycle and particular categories such as ambulances.\n\nShare\n\n3 W -\n\n3 wheeler Indian market is ~20000-22000 crore market with domestic 3 wheeler market being ~15000 crores and Export market is ~7500 crores.\n\n3 wheelers are primarily goods and passenger rickshaws. Bajaj Auto is the largest player in India, followed by Piaggio and Mahindra. 3 wheeler volumes are 7% below it\u2019s all time high volumes in 2020.\n\n\nBajaj Auto is the largest 3W player in the country followed by Piaggio and Mahindra. Other smaller players include Atul Auto and TVS domestic\n\n\nEV -\n\n3W has the highest EV penetration with ~15.6% on conventional 3W. If you include low voltage E-3W, (found in Delhi / Jaipur among other cities) EV penetration is already a ~56%\n\n\nThere are a lot E-3 W companies who have raised private capital (below list with last round valuation) and may get listed in the future\n\n\u2022 Mahindra LMM - ~6600 crores\n\n\u2022 Altigreen Propulsion system - ~2500 crores\n\n\u2022 Euler Motors - ~1300 crores\n\n\u2022Atul Greentech \u2013 983 crores\n\nHow has 3 W performed -\n\n3W growth has been decent at 6% for first 9M.\n\n\nCompanies and exposure to 3W -\n\nAtul Auto is the only pure-play 3 W listed player currently.\n\nBajaj Auto and TVS derives ~15% / 5% of revenues from 3W.\n\n\n\nConclusion - Broadly CV has seen de-growth in FY25 so far, No material outliers have been identified across segments in CV. Growth in CV\u2019s is likely to be muted over the near future. Interest rate cut can materially aid CV cycle.\n\nBroadly, there are 6 listed CV players which can disproportionately benefit depending on CV scenario.\n\n 3W market evolution is a great primer for how auto-sector will evolve in electrification over the next few years and a lot of opportunities will develop and evolve in 3W space.\n\n\nThe article is much better read with charts which reddit doesn't allow - Feel free to check out the article here\nhttps://cashcows.substack.com/p/all-you-need-to-know-2-automobile-686\n\n\n",

Ola is the largest E2W followed by TVS, Bajaj, Ather and Hero.\n\n\nHonda\u2019s Activa and Suzuki\u2019s E-Access deliveries in the next few months will result in market share moderation for all the above peers.\n\n\nHow has FY25 been for 2 wheelers and where are they placed ?\n\n2W have been the fastest growing sector in FY25 so far, seeing ~10.6% growth till December 2024. 2 wheelers are set for the second highest volumes delivered ever.\n\n\nSuzuki and Honda has been the fastest growing domestic company growing over 29% / 23% YTD followed by TVS at 13.6%.\n\nThe scooter portfolio of the incumbents continues to materially outgrow the bikes portfolio.\n\nBajaj, Hero and Eicher volumes have been in the 6-8% growth rate.\n\n\nThere are pockets where each of the companies are placed which can benefit them, broad one liner for where each company is placed and what can help them grow faster.\n\nHero MotoCorp -\n\nWhat\u2019s happening - Hero has been continuously losing market share due to a weak EV and Scooter portfolio , 125-250CC and entry level 100 CC not doing well due to stress in rural economy.\n\nWhen can Hero Outperform - If Rural recovery is sharp and faster than Urban recovery and if Hero(+Ather) continues to hold material market share in the EV segment.\n\nTVS Motors -\n\nWhat\u2019s happening - TVS has been continuously garnering market share due to a strong Scooter and 125-250 CC portfolio.\n\nWhen can TVS underperform - TVS Portfolio is at the highest risk of electrification (~61% of volumes in Scooters and Mopeds) resulting in probable material market share loss. EV market share is a key monitorable.\n\nBajaj Auto -\n\nWhat\u2019s happening -\n\nBajaj has been growing in-line with market owing to a decent 125-250 CC portfolio.\n\nHowever, Bajaj Auto derives ~40% of exports from 2&3W and exports have been under pressure.\n\nWhen can Bajaj Auto outperform -\n\nStrong recovery in Africa and South Asia primarily Nigeria, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other countries.\n\nBajaj\u2019s EV market share is rapidly increasing and if they are to maintain the same in long run\n\n3W portfolio contributes ~15% of volumes, Strong 3W performance can help Bajaj Auto.\n\nEicher Motors -\n\nWhat\u2019s happening -\n\nEicher Motors has been losing market share as >250CC market has seen increased competitive intensity from Bajaj Triumph and Hero with Harley Davidson.\n\nWhen can Eicher outperform -\n\nEicher\u2019s ability to stay ahead of the curve in innovation and garnering market share in >250 CC and premium bikes\n\nExports growing materially faster (currently only 9% of volumes)\n\nOla - Ola\u2019s success or failure will be determined by EV market share\n\nOther listed players\n\nGreaves Electric Mobility - Ampere\n\nRattan India Enterprises - Revolt\n\nWardWizard Innovation - Joy E-bikes\n\nConclusion - Broadly 2W is the best performing sub-segment in FY25 so far and is expected to be the fastest growing segment in FY25.\n",

Here are the highlights:  \n  \n\u00d8 Achieving financial goals > beating benchmarks  \n\u00d8 Investment success is driven by asset allocation and compounding duration over individual stock/scheme selection  \n\u00d8 Midcap starts at 80k cr market cap and small-cap at 25k crore - no concerns regarding PPFAS Flexi Cap AUM  \n\u00d8 4.5 lakh crores are invested in thematic/sectoral funds  \n\u00d8 No update from RBI on overseas investments. This question is asked to new governor now  \n\u00d8 Optimistic on India, but cautious due to high valuations. 80% invested but maintain 20% cash  \n\u00d8 Promoters are selling stakes (e.g., Whirlpool, Hyundai, LG, Walmart in Flipkart), while QIP activity and PE exits increase. Retail investors focus on SIPs, while promoters find value in QIPs  \n\u00d8 Okay to lose 50% of clients through redemptions than losing 50% of clients\u2019 money by doing foolish things on investment side  \n\u00d8 Exposure to AI through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. Solar exposure is via transmission companies  \n\u00d8 Conservative Hybrid Funds cap equity at 25%. DAAF has a minimum of 35% equity. CHF taxation is as per slab rates, while DAAF offers LTCG benefits beyond 2 years. CHF can invest in REITs/InvITs; DAAF cannot  \n\u00d8 Rising investments in small-cap, mid-cap, thematic funds, AIFs, PMS, and smallcases explain their resilience in current market relative to large companies  \n\u00d8 BSE was a miss. Thought NSE would be a dominant player, but BSE made a remarkable comeback. Participated through CDSL.  \n\u00d8 Maruti (PF stock) \u2013 Only a pure four-wheeler play (others have commercial vehicle, investments in other subsidiary) \u2013 tracking M&M, Tata motors too. Maruti have missed on SUV, EV front but its fine \u2013 as technologies are still evolving  \n\u00d8 Sold UTI AMC & Bajaj Auto due to valuations. Question on capital markets \u2013 due to new IND AS, earnings volatility has increased a lot. Capital market business is inherently volatile and IND AS have made them more. Run up in stocks has gone up \u2013 so trimmed/sold  \n\u00d8 ITC \u2013 Not as attractive as it was when we bought. Still reasonable valued now. On ITC Hotels \u2013 demerged and asset-light  \n\u00d8 Overall investment returns are driven by three factors: Dividend yield, Earnings growth, P/E multiple (going up/steady/down)  \n\u00d8 Liquidity \u2013 to be looked from 2-3 factors in conjunction. First \u2013 how much of your investment strategy depends upon the churn (buy and hold ours). Second \u2013 Client concentration (less than 2% for our #1 client)  \n\u00d8 In India, perception has built up mid/small cap co.s will do well than large caps. In USA, its reverse. Not always true.  \n\u00d8 HDFC Bank being a biggie does not mean it\u2019s at a disadvantage  \n\u00d8 Smaller AUM of PPFAS Tax saver does not give advantage to PPFAS Flexi. We follow the same approach. Just \u2013 no foreign stocks & arbitrage allowed. Tax saver \u2013 min. 80% invested all time. Flexi \u2013 65%.\n\n\u00d8 PPFAS DAAF maintains a fixed income duration of 3.25\u20133.5 years  \n\u00d8 On government regulation \u2013 you cannot avoid this is probably any sector (pvt or public)  \n\u00d8 Exited Accelya Kale due to concerns over its parent\u2019s product roadmap  \n\u00d8 Missed Nvidia. Fundamental assumption was wrong in this case.  \n\u00d8 Succession plan \u2013 we have alignment of interests. Financially: ESOPs, investments in PPFAS units, on the same page on strategy, organization moving forward. Built a relationship that has passed professional things.  \n\u00d8 Exploring a new asset class (10L min.) under evolving guidelines  \n\u00d8 No plans for the AMC IPO for next couple of years  \n\u00d8 On ESG: Governance \u2013 we consider this even before ESG was a thing. E & S part \u2013 neutral. Business is not black & white.  \n\u00d8 Real estate is difficult for conviction-led investing, but proxies look attractive. Book \u2013 Inside Real Estate by Sushil Sayal. Surprised if we buy any RE developer in next 3-6 months.  \n\u00d8 We do track momentum, factor based (volatility of business etc.). Models are built to identify long term trends  \n\u00d8 Hiring a financial advisor is one of the best investments.  \n\u00d8 A mistake is not where a stock price went down, or its good thing if it went up. These are an outcome. Process > Outcome.\n\n\u00d8 Not considering investment in China  \n  \n",

They manufacture EVs and certain core EV components like battery packs, motors and vehicle frames at the Ola Futurefactory. Ola commenced delivery of their first EV model, the Ola S1 Pro, in December 2021. They are a pure EV company and their R&D and technology including in-house design, engineering, manufacturing, are all singularly focused on building EV products. In August 2023, Ola also announced a line-up of motorcycles comprising four models.  \n  \nThe Ola Futurefactory is the largest integrated and automated E2W manufacturing plant in India in terms of production capacity **(** **total installed capacity of 6.79 lakh per annum)** They have R &D facilities in India, UK and the US. Ola Electric manufactures EVs and certain core EV components like battery packs, motors and vehicle frames at the Ola Futurefactory. They are also building EV hub in Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts in Tamil Nadu, which is expected to span up to 2,000 acres of land, and includes Ola Futurefactory, **upcoming Ola Gigafactory for cell manufacturing in Krishnagiri district** and co-located suppliers in Krishnagiri district. Their products Ola S1 Air and S1 Pro ( Gen2) are eligible under PLI incentive scheme where they will get 13-18% of sales value.  \n  \n**Network**  \nThey operates own direct-to-customer (D2C) omnichannel distribution network across India, comprising **870 experience centres and 431 service centres** (of which 429 service centres are located within experience centres).  \n  \n**R&D**  \nTheir R&D and technology platform consists of the following technologies which are interconnected: (a) software, including in-house developed operating system, MoveOS, (b) electronics, (c) motor and drivetrain, (d) cells and battery packs and (e) manufacturing technology. **There are 959 employees in R&D**, total employees 7369, on roll 4011. Employee attrition at 44%.  \n  \nOla currently sources cell from outside vendors. Ola is developing cell manufacturing capacity in Ola Gigafactory which will make them independent in terms of cell manufacturing. **Ola has 88 registered patents and 217 patent applications pending in India.**  \n\n\n**Finance**  \nOla facilitates financing through one of their Group Companies, Ola Financial Services Private Limited (OFSPL) and in partnership with 12 financial institutions that offer loan tenures of up to five years. **53% of Ola vehicles are financed through OFSPL**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/144o5mb75agd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=02706fbd014e71f76d85ebc03f68e9c545e6ecdb\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qrjrnky05agd1.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=7597e89c159155b4637d951edea8640ac1c3a750\n\n\n\n  \n**Products**  \n  \nOla Electric has 7 models  \n  \n**Scooters**  \n-S1 Pro  \n-S1 Air  \n-S1 X+  \n-S1 X ( 2 KWh)  \n-S1 X ( 3 KWh)  \n-S1 X ( 4 KWh)\n\n  \n  \n**Motorcycles** ( upcoming in H1 FY26)  \n  \n-Diamondhead  \n-Roadster  \n-Adventure  \n-Cruiser  \n\n\n  \n**Warranty**\n\nOla offers a **standard warranty of three years/40,000 km** (whichever is earlier) on battery and EV scooter components and a standard warranty of eight years/80,000 km (whichever is earlier) on battery packs.  \n  \n**Technology**  \nIn January , 2024, Ola Electric officially launched MoveOS version 4, which includes various new features such as navigation powered by Ola Maps , call filter, \u2018find my scooter\u2019, geofencing, time fencing, anti-theft alert, fall detection, hill hold, auto turn-off indicators, ride journal and energy insights. Ola EV scooters are connected to their network and designed to transmit data through our vehicle telematics systems, which enables us to continually enhance our product features and performance.  \n  \n**87% of the components used in three EV scooter models, the Ola S1 Pro, the Ola S1 Air, the Ola S1 X+ are common across all three models.** For example, the Ola S1 Pro, the Ola S1 Air and the Ola S1 X+ use the same battery pack. Modular and adaptable nature of platform architecture will help to drive down costs and enable Ola to achieve fast product development cycles, thereby reducing time to market.

Of the total production, \\~4 Mn units were exported. **16-17 Mn units were sold domestically**. Globally, India is the second largest 2W market in terms of domestic sales volumes. Value of 2W domestic market size in India was Rs 1.4-1.6 Tn (US$17-20 Bn) in FY 2023. The TAM for 2W export from India is between Rs 7-8 Lakh cr. Markets like Africa, South East Asia provide an export opportunity for Indian OEM\u2019s which further increases their TAM with an **export opportunity of around 100 million unit globally.**\n\n  \n**E2W penetration in India is expected to expand from approximately 5.4%** ( China 85-90%) of domestic 2W registrations sales in Fiscal 2024 **to 41-56% of the domestic 2W** sales volume by Fiscal 2028, according to the Redseer Report. EVs have lower total cost of ownership (TCO) vs ICE vehicles, for e.g., electric two wheelers (that have led EV adoption in India) **have \\~55% lower TCO vs their ICE counterparts** over the life of the vehicle. This is driven by lower fuel costs (roughly 1/10th of ICE) and other savings on vehicle spends (maintenance, registration subsidies)  \n  \nHigh fuel prices and the resulting total cost of ownership (TCO) have limited **2W penetration to \\~160 2Ws per \u2018000 people in India in CY 2022**, which is much lower than some of the SEA countries ( China 300-350, Indonesia 450-470), suggesting a large headroom for 2W growth ahead. Industry is projected to grow at 11% CAGR for next 5 years.  \n  \n**Premiumization trend**  \nSegment share of entry level motorcycles have drastically reduced since FY20. Premium motorcycles and scooters are being sold more, as evident from segment share diagram.  \n  \nMultiple factors are pushing the personal mobility demand towards 2Ws:  \n  \na. Need for affordable personal mobility  \nb. Current state of road transport infrastructure  \nc. Strong supply  \nd.

These incentives are linked to incremental sales of new-age technology products manufactured domestically.  \n**Automobiles and auto components sector (budget: Rs 25900cr )**- The PLI proposes financial incentives of up to 18% (sales-linked) to boost domestic manufacturing of AAT products (min. 50% domestic value addition will be required) and attract investments. This scheme will be applicable from FY 2024 for a total of five consecutive financial years.  \n  \n**Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery (budget: Rs18100cr) Scheme** was launched for setting up ACC Battery Storage manufacturing facilities in India, with a total manufacturing capacity of 50 Giga Watt- hour (GWh) for 5 years.  \n  \n**India Semiconductor Mission 2021 (budget: \u20b9 76000)**, included various schemes (such as semiconductor fabrication, display fabrication, compound semiconductor & semiconductor assembly, testing, making & packaging, and design-linked incentive).  \n  \n**Faster Adoption and Manufacturing (of Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME)**  \nSubsidy phase I ( budget 900cr) was launched between FY15 and FY19 , phase II was launched between FY20 and FY24 ( Budget 10000cr)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0eta4pw5agd1.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=60a3da6843ae7c898417624d035e1ddceef682d5\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xlrf9lsy5agd1.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba103ae6e7093d3df05c4325d168cf83a522b672\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/thc2ort06agd1.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=588071e45fe297abbab7553e8abe49c0c2bb6cc7\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nqshav336agd1.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=e00b4c95ef8ed9ed67cadc5f6141c4308a748f07\n\n\n\n  \n**Operating metrics**  \n  \n**Ola Electric has sold 14393 scooters in FY22, 152500 scooters in FY23 and 328940 scooters in FY24.**  \n  \n**R&D cost for FY24 is 385cr comprising 7% of revenues**.

Once they do, they might end up sweeping the market share from Ola Electric.**  \n  \n**Plus dealers of Ola electric won't survive selling only a few EVs, unit economics won' t permit that. In such a situation, network expansion, especially to Tier 2/3 cities ( where volumes are low) will be a challenge.**  \n  \nR&D and product development constitute 7.7% and 19.3% of revenues for FY24 and FY23 respectively.\u00a0  \n  \nFAME II subsidies have been scaled down from 40% to 15% in Jun '23 , following which there was temporary drop in sales which recovered by festive season. In future, introducing such subsidies may play a pivotal role in EV 2wheeler sales.  \n  \nOla plans to import 2 key components in cell manufacturing ( CAM and AAM) from China, which might face problems due to geopolitical issues in future.  \n  \n**Ola electric has 4 e-scooter models which constituted 98% of revenues in FY24, which is definitely a concentration risk.**  \n  \nOla Electric is relatively new having 3 years experience in market, so they might face some issues which are unsolvable. ( provided they don't have any technology partner to guide). Plus due to lack of historic data, they may face problem of inventory management wrt variants and colours. They are trying to develop in-house cell manufacturing capabilities which, if faces issues will cause loss of product reputation in market.  \n  \n37% of parts are imported from suppliers outside India. Top 10 suppliers supplied 60% of parts.\u00a0  \n  \nEmployee attrition rates of 44% is too abnormal, needs to be looked into with caution.  \n  \nProfitability of Ola depends on availing PLI incentive schemes from GOI.  \n  \nCapacity utilisation of Ola electric stands at 49% in FY24, which affects its profitability and hinders from achieving economies of scale.  \n  \nOla has related party transactions to the tune of 25% of revenues, one must dig deeper into those before investing.  \n  \nBattery cost being 30% of vehicle cost, if battery life is poor then Ola scooters will earn bad reputation in market ( full cycle of battery is yet to be seen in most vehicles).  \n  \n  \n**Valuation**  \n  \nOla electric is valued at P/S of 6.69, whereas TVS at 3.11, Eicher at 7.87, Hero at 2.79, Bajaj at 5.82.

        "selftext": "Commercial Vehicles (CV\u2019s) -\n\nCV\u2019s are broadly classified into Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV\u2019s) and Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicles (MHCV\u2019s).\n\nLCVs include vans, pickup trucks, and small delivery trucks, while MHCVs include large tractor-trailers, dump trucks, and heavy-duty delivery trucks.\n\nBroadly CV market is ~2,00,000 crores market with MHCV is ~1,30,000 crore market whereas LCV\u2019s being ~70000 crores market.\n\nBoth MHCV and LCV are ~5% and ~3% lower than peak levels.\n\n\n\nMHCV Market Share -\n\nMHCV is a larger segment with 3 large players, Tata Motors (~47% MS), Ashok Leyland (~31%) )and Volvo-Eicher CV (~8.2%).\n\nMHCV have smaller players in sub-segments such as SML Isuzu (buses), Mahindra, Olectra Greentech and JBM Auto (e-buses)\n\nTata Motors over past 10 years has lost ~800 bps primarily to Ashok Leyland and VECV (~600 and ~200 bps respectively)\n\n\nLCV\u2019s on the other hand has 2 large players i.e Mahindra (~43% MS) and Tata Motors (~34% MS), with Ashok Leyland and Force Motors being the smaller players. M&M has overtaken Tata Motors to be the largest LCV player in India.\n\n\nE-CV\u2019s -\n\nECV\u2019s have the lowest penetration at 0.4%, the only sub-segment which has grown faster has been E-bus due to government bus and E-bus penetration has been higher than E-4 W.\n\n\nHow has the year been for CV\u2019s in FY25 so far ?\n\n\nCV has seen a de-growth of 1% for first 9M, and most companies expects similiar performance in Q4.\n\nLCV\u2019s has de-grown by 3% whereas MHCV\u2019s have been flat.\n\n\n\nAshok Leyland - Benefits largely on account of strong MHCV Cycle\n\nTata CV - (will list on stock markets soon post demerger of Tata Motors) - Benefits from strong MHCV and LCV cycle.\n\nMahindra - Benefits largely on account of strong MHCV Cycle\n\nVECV - Benefits largely on account of Strong MHCV cycle. VECV is ~15% for Eicher Motors.\n\nJBM Auto and Olectra Greentech - Can benefit disproportionately if E-bus penetration increases materially and companies garner higher incremental market share\n\nSML Isuzu - Bus portfolio doing well\n\nForce Motors - Benefits largely on account of strong LCV cycle and particular categories such as ambulances.\n\nShare\n\n3 W -\n\n3 wheeler Indian market is ~20000-22000 crore market with domestic 3 wheeler market being ~15000 crores and Export market is ~7500 crores.\n\n3 wheelers are primarily goods and passenger rickshaws. Bajaj Auto is the largest player in India, followed by Piaggio and Mahindra. 3 wheeler volumes are 7% below it\u2019s all time high volumes in 2020.\n\n\nBajaj Auto is the largest 3W player in the country followed by Piaggio and Mahindra. Other smaller players include Atul Auto and TVS domestic\n\n\nEV -\n\n3W has the highest EV penetration with ~15.6% on conventional 3W. If you include low voltage E-3W, (found in Delhi / Jaipur among other cities) EV penetration is already a ~56%\n\n\nThere are a lot E-3 W companies who have raised private capital (below list with last round valuation) and may get listed in the future\n\n\u2022 Mahindra LMM - ~6600 crores\n\n\u2022 Altigreen Propulsion system - ~2500 crores\n\n\u2022 Euler Motors - ~1300 crores\n\n\u2022Atul Greentech \u2013 983 crores\n\nHow has 3 W performed -\n\n3W growth has been decent at 6% for first 9M.\n\n\nCompanies and exposure to 3W -\n\nAtul Auto is the only pure-play 3 W listed player currently.\n\nBajaj Auto and TVS derives ~15% / 5% of revenues from 3W.\n\n\n\nConclusion - Broadly CV has seen de-growth in FY25 so far, No material outliers have been identified across segments in CV. Growth in CV\u2019s is likely to be muted over the near future. Interest rate cut can materially aid CV cycle.\n\nBroadly, there are 6 listed CV players which can disproportionately benefit depending on CV scenario.\n\n 3W market evolution is a great primer for how auto-sector will evolve in electrification over the next few years and a lot of opportunities will develop and evolve in 3W space.\n\n\nThe article is much better read with charts which reddit doesn't allow - Feel free to check out the article here\nhttps://cashcows.substack.com/p/all-you-need-to-know-2-automobile-686\n\n\n",

EV growth has been ~30-35%.\n\n99% of volumes are in EV scooters and EV penetration in scooters is ~16%.\n\n\nEV is an evolving market, with material market share shifts every month. We use a 3M moving average to arrive at market share and it is a better reflection of prospective market share.\n\nAs of December. Ola is the largest E2W followed by TVS, Bajaj, Ather and Hero.\n\n\nHonda\u2019s Activa and Suzuki\u2019s E-Access deliveries in the next few months will result in market share moderation for all the above peers.\n\n\nHow has FY25 been for 2 wheelers and where are they placed ?\n\n2W have been the fastest growing sector in FY25 so far, seeing ~10.6% growth till December 2024. 2 wheelers are set for the second highest volumes delivered ever.\n\n\nSuzuki and Honda has been the fastest growing domestic company growing over 29% / 23% YTD followed by TVS at 13.6%.\n\nThe scooter portfolio of the incumbents continues to materially outgrow the bikes portfolio.\n\nBajaj, Hero and Eicher volumes have been in the 6-8% growth rate.\n\n\nThere are pockets where each of the companies are placed which can benefit them, broad one liner for where each company is placed and what can help them grow faster.\n\nHero MotoCorp -\n\nWhat\u2019s happening - Hero has been continuously losing market share due to a weak EV and Scooter portfolio , 125-250CC and entry level 100 CC not doing well due to stress in rural economy.\n\nWhen can Hero Outperform - If Rural recovery is sharp and faster than Urban recovery and if Hero(+Ather) continues to hold material market share in the EV segment.\n\nTVS Motors -\n\nWhat\u2019s happening - TVS has been continuously garnering market share due to a strong Scooter and 125-250 CC portfolio.\n\nWhen can TVS underperform - TVS Portfolio is at the highest risk of electrification (~61% of volumes in Scooters and Mopeds) resulting in probable material market share loss. EV market share is a key monitorable.\n\nBajaj Auto -\n\nWhat\u2019s happening -\n\nBajaj has been growing in-line with market owing to a decent 125-250 CC portfolio.\n\nHowever, Bajaj Auto derives ~40% of exports from 2&3W and exports have been under pressure.\n\nWhen can Bajaj Auto outperform -\n\nStrong recovery in Africa and South Asia primarily Nigeria, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other countries.\n\nBajaj\u2019s EV market share is rapidly increasing and if they are to maintain the same in long run\n\n3W portfolio contributes ~15% of volumes, Strong 3W performance can help Bajaj Auto.\n\nEicher Motors -\n\nWhat\u2019s happening -\n\nEicher Motors has been losing market share as >250CC market has seen increased competitive intensity from Bajaj Triumph and Hero with Harley Davidson.\n\nWhen can Eicher outperform -\n\nEicher\u2019s ability to stay ahead of the curve in innovation and garnering market share in >250 CC and premium bikes\n\nExports growing materially faster (currently only 9% of volumes)\n\nOla - Ola\u2019s success or failure will be determined by EV market share\n\nOther listed players\n\nGreaves Electric Mobility - Ampere\n\nRattan India Enterprises - Revolt\n\nWardWizard Innovation - Joy E-bikes\n\nConclusion - Broadly 2W is the best performing sub-segment in FY25 so far and is expected to be the fastest growing segment in FY25.\n",

Here are the highlights:  \n  \n\u00d8 Achieving financial goals > beating benchmarks  \n\u00d8 Investment success is driven by asset allocation and compounding duration over individual stock/scheme selection  \n\u00d8 Midcap starts at 80k cr market cap and small-cap at 25k crore - no concerns regarding PPFAS Flexi Cap AUM  \n\u00d8 4.5 lakh crores are invested in thematic/sectoral funds  \n\u00d8 No update from RBI on overseas investments. This question is asked to new governor now  \n\u00d8 Optimistic on India, but cautious due to high valuations. 80% invested but maintain 20% cash  \n\u00d8 Promoters are selling stakes (e.g., Whirlpool, Hyundai, LG, Walmart in Flipkart), while QIP activity and PE exits increase. Retail investors focus on SIPs, while promoters find value in QIPs  \n\u00d8 Okay to lose 50% of clients through redemptions than losing 50% of clients\u2019 money by doing foolish things on investment side  \n\u00d8 Exposure to AI through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. Solar exposure is via transmission companies  \n\u00d8 Conservative Hybrid Funds cap equity at 25%. DAAF has a minimum of 35% equity. CHF taxation is as per slab rates, while DAAF offers LTCG benefits beyond 2 years. CHF can invest in REITs/InvITs; DAAF cannot  \n\u00d8 Rising investments in small-cap, mid-cap, thematic funds, AIFs, PMS, and smallcases explain their resilience in current market relative to large companies  \n\u00d8 BSE was a miss. Thought NSE would be a dominant player, but BSE made a remarkable comeback. Participated through CDSL.  \n\u00d8 Maruti (PF stock) \u2013 Only a pure four-wheeler play (others have commercial vehicle, investments in other subsidiary) \u2013 tracking M&M, Tata motors too. Maruti have missed on SUV, EV front but its fine \u2013 as technologies are still evolving  \n\u00d8 Sold UTI AMC & Bajaj Auto due to valuations. Question on capital markets \u2013 due to new IND AS, earnings volatility has increased a lot. Capital market business is inherently volatile and IND AS have made them more. Run up in stocks has gone up \u2013 so trimmed/sold  \n\u00d8 ITC \u2013 Not as attractive as it was when we bought. Still reasonable valued now. On ITC Hotels \u2013 demerged and asset-light  \n\u00d8 Overall investment returns are driven by three factors: Dividend yield, Earnings growth, P/E multiple (going up/steady/down)  \n\u00d8 Liquidity \u2013 to be looked from 2-3 factors in conjunction. First \u2013 how much of your investment strategy depends upon the churn (buy and hold ours). Second \u2013 Client concentration (less than 2% for our #1 client)  \n\u00d8 In India, perception has built up mid/small cap co.s will do well than large caps. In USA, its reverse. Not always true.  \n\u00d8 HDFC Bank being a biggie does not mean it\u2019s at a disadvantage  \n\u00d8 Smaller AUM of PPFAS Tax saver does not give advantage to PPFAS Flexi. We follow the same approach. Just \u2013 no foreign stocks & arbitrage allowed. Tax saver \u2013 min. 80% invested all time. Flexi \u2013 65%.\n\n\u00d8 PPFAS DAAF maintains a fixed income duration of 3.25\u20133.5 years  \n\u00d8 On government regulation \u2013 you cannot avoid this is probably any sector (pvt or public)  \n\u00d8 Exited Accelya Kale due to concerns over its parent\u2019s product roadmap  \n\u00d8 Missed Nvidia. Fundamental assumption was wrong in this case.  \n\u00d8 Succession plan \u2013 we have alignment of interests. Financially: ESOPs, investments in PPFAS units, on the same page on strategy, organization moving forward. Built a relationship that has passed professional things.  \n\u00d8 Exploring a new asset class (10L min.) under evolving guidelines  \n\u00d8 No plans for the AMC IPO for next couple of years  \n\u00d8 On ESG: Governance \u2013 we consider this even before ESG was a thing. E & S part \u2013 neutral. Business is not black & white.  \n\u00d8 Real estate is difficult for conviction-led investing, but proxies look attractive. Book \u2013 Inside Real Estate by Sushil Sayal. Surprised if we buy any RE developer in next 3-6 months.  \n\u00d8 We do track momentum, factor based (volatility of business etc.). Models are built to identify long term trends  \n\u00d8 Hiring a financial advisor is one of the best investments.  \n\u00d8 A mistake is not where a stock price went down, or its good thing if it went up. These are an outcome. Process > Outcome.\n\n\u00d8 Not considering investment in China  \n  \n",

Used moneycontrol portal and forum for tracking various news and chatter related to a particular stock but it has become super annoying due to ADs every 10-15 sec. So, I have built a simple tracker.\n\nWhat it does is:\n\n* It tracks several sources like, ET, BS, News Portals etc.\n* Stock wise news notifications / section\n* Can be used as a forum for discussion about a particular stock\n\nCurrently, it solves my purpose of accessing all news related to a stock at one place. But, I want to develop it further and add more sources / information. Can also add stock specific information like various technical indicators, chart patterns, bulk deal etc.\n\nIt would be great if few of you guys can use it and let me know if it is useful and what improvements can be made in it. You can access it inside telegram by searching \"Dalal Street Tracker\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5jdepsem98bd1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=87bda8df5b14eaa4eb06234728b530ceb4811d86\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvhxrdfm98bd1.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=59a9c962d94ed2d2af9c3b3da6c8834cbaef130a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6uucjrcn98bd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b242bb3a3aa402db9a3f1b8c96c026b4b78a06a2\n\n",
