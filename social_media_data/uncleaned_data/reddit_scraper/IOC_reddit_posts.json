        "selftext": "\n\nThe share prices of OMCs have fallen significantly from their all-time highs, making their valuations very attractive.\nThese stocks are trading at lower P/E ratios compared to their historical averages and other high-growth sectors.\nCrude Oil Outlook Favors OMCs\n\nWith Trump in power and his push to boost U.S. crude oil production, global oil prices are unlikely to surge.\nA stable crude price range of $65-$75 will help OMCs maintain refining margins and reduce earnings volatility.\nUnder-Recoveries & Government Support\n\nOMCs are currently facing under-recoveries on LPG sales, estimated at \u20b930,000 crore.\nThe government has already provided \u20b912,000 crore in subsidies, and additional support is expected, which will directly improve their financials.\nGovernment Backing & Policy Support\n\nThe government holds a majority stake in all three OMCs, ensuring long-term stability and financial backing.\nOil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has been praising the financial performance of OMCs, signaling continued government confidence in the sector.\nThe disinvestment of BPCL was scrapped, indicating that the government sees growth potential in oil marketing companies.\nHigh Dividend Yield \u2013 A Major Advantage\n\nOMCs offer strong dividend yields of 6-9%, which are comparable to fixed deposit (FD) returns.\nThis makes them an attractive investment for long-term investors looking for stable returns along with potential capital appreciation.\nBetter Value Compared to Overvalued Stocks\n\nInstead of chasing high P/E stocks like Zomato, Dixon, and Trent, investors should focus on OMCs, which offer a much better risk-reward ratio.\nThese stocks provide gradual wealth generation along with yearly dividends, making them a solid choice for long-term portfolios.",

        "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/dpq0dze8b1je1.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=8699538a109a1127c6749197786a0b44fb3e8d1e\n\n  \nHey,,  \nIf you are into short selling like me (and making money in last 2 months), the good news is that US has announced reciprocal tariffs and it will share details on 1st April (country wise), India is already knows as 'Tariff king' as said by Trump.\n\nAs a short seller who use AI a lot, here's my research for possible shorting oppurtunity:\n\n# Which Indian Sectors Are at Risk for Tariffs?\n\nGiven Trump's trade policies and focus on protecting American industries, these sectors are the most likely targets for tariffs:\n\n# 1. Pharmaceuticals (Exports: $7.55 billion) \u2013 High Risk\n\n* The U.S. imports a massive amount of **generic drugs** from India.\n* Trump has pushed for **onshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing** in the U.S.\n* **Likely action**: Higher tariffs on **generic medicines** from India to protect U.S. pharma firms.\n\n# 2. Precious Metals & Stones (Exports: $10.17 billion) \u2013 Moderate-High Risk\n\n* India is one of the biggest exporters of **cut and polished diamonds** to the U.S.\n* Trump previously **increased tariffs on Chinese jewelry**; he may do the same to India.\n* **Likely action**: Tariffs on **diamonds and jewelry** to promote local manufacturing.\n\n# 3. Electrical & Electronic Equipment (Exports: $9.89 billion) \u2013 Moderate-High Risk\n\n* Includes **Motherson Sumi, ABB India, and Exide Industries**.\n* India exports **electronic components and auto electronics**, competing with U.S. firms.\n* **Trump previously targeted China with tech-related tariffs.**\n* **Likely action**: Import duties on **Indian auto electronics, semiconductors, and batteries**.\n\n# 4. Automotive & Auto Parts (Exports: $2.58 billion) \u2013 Moderate Risk\n\n* **Hero MotoCorp** and **Motherson Sumi** export motorcycles and auto components.\n* Trump previously **imposed tariffs on European & Chinese auto imports**.\n* **Likely action**: Tariffs on **Indian two-wheelers and auto components** to support U.S. manufacturers.\n\n# 5. Textiles & Apparel (Exports: $2.64 billion) \u2013 Moderate Risk\n\n* India is a **top textile and apparel exporter** to the U.S.\n* Trump **previously imposed tariffs on China\u2019s textile exports**.\n* **Likely action**: Higher duties on **Indian garments** to boost U.S. production.\n\n# 6. Oil & Petrochemicals (Exports: $6.52 billion) \u2013 Low-Moderate Risk\n\n* **Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and ONGC** export refined petroleum to the U.S.\n* The U.S. wants **energy independence**, so **tariffs on Indian oil** could be possible.\n* **Likely action**: A tariff on **Indian refined oil products**, but impact may be low.\n\n# 7. IT & Software Services (Not in the export goods list, but a huge sector) \u2013 Low Risk\n\n* India dominates **IT services and outsourcing** for American companies.\n* Instead of tariffs, Trump might **tighten visa rules (H-1B restrictions)**.\n\nHowever, this is just one parameter, rest you can check in weekly which stocks are already going down and on daily check if they are over bought, this given oppurtunity to enter the market>\n\nI am not against Indian market, I am just a trader who makes money on both sides and right now for this year I am highly bearish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1fvqgtwbc1je1.jpg?width=936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffa245f2acf0d41515f2cf450893277d04806aeb\n\n(My positions today at 10.20 AM, 14th Feb, 2025)  \n",

                "body": "### Portfolio Overview\nYou\u2019ve invested in 14 assets: 12 individual stocks, 1 sectoral ETF (Nifty SBI ETF), and 1 gold ETF (Gold Bees). Total allocation sums to 100%, so I assume this is your full portfolio. Here\u2019s the breakdown by sector/type based on your holdings:\n\n- **Energy/PSUs**: NTPC (6.64%), NTPC Green (9.28%), ONGC (6.97%), IOC (4.81%), IRFC (5.56%) \u2013 **33.26%**\n- **Finance**: SBI (7.66%), Manappuram (6.13%), Bajaj Housing Finance (2.55%) \u2013 **16.34%**\n- **Pharma**: Dr. Reddy\u2019s (5.82%), Natco Pharma (6.96%) \u2013 **12.78%**\n- **Auto**: Tata Motors (9.41%) \u2013 **9.41%**\n- **IT**: Wipro (7.23%) \u2013 **7.23%**\n- **FMCG**: ITC (4.87%) \u2013 **4.87%**\n- **ETFs**: Nifty SBI ETF (6.02%), Gold Bees (9.96%) \u2013 **15.98%**\n\n**Key Observations**:\n- Heavy PSU exposure (33.26%), especially energy-related (NTPC, ONGC, IOC, IRFC).\n- Diversified across sectors, but concentrated in a few stocks (e.g., NTPC Green, Tata Motors, Gold Bees each ~9-10%).\n- Current ETF allocation (Nifty SBI + Gold Bees) is ~16%, with intent to increase it.\n\n### Performance Context: Down 20% Since July 2024\nYou started investing in July 2024, and as of March 2, 2025 (8 months later), you\u2019re down 20%. Let\u2019s contextualize this:\n- **Market Trends (July 2024\u2013March 2025)**: The Nifty 50, a broad market benchmark, grew ~5-7% in this period (based on historical trends and assuming no major crash by March 2025). However, midcaps, smallcaps, and PSUs (where you\u2019re heavily invested) saw volatility\u2014some PSU stocks corrected 15-25% after a 2023-early 2024 rally.\n- **Your Portfolio**: A 20% loss suggests your picks underperformed the broader market, likely due to sector-specific declines or stock selection.\n\n**Is This Normal?**: For a beginner starting mid-2024:\n- Yes, it\u2019s possible. Markets don\u2019t always go up, and 2024 saw profit booking in PSU and midcap stocks after a multi-year bull run.\n- No, it\u2019s not ideal. A 20% drop against a flat-to-up broader market indicates some stock-specific or allocation issues.\n\n**Red Flags**:\n- **Wipro**: IT sector faced headwinds in 2024 (US slowdown, fewer contracts). Fundamentally weaker than peers.\n- **PSU Overweight (IRFC, NTPC, ONGC, IOC)**: 2024 saw PSU profit-taking after a 2023 boom\u2014your timing might\u2019ve coincided with this.\n- No glaring \u201cwrong\u201d stocks, but high exposure to volatile PSUs and midcaps likely amplified your loss.\n\n\n- **Current Volatility**: \n  - PSU-heavy (33%) and midcaps (e.g., Manappuram, Natco) are volatile\u201420% drop reflects this.\n  - Gold Bees (10%) and Nifty SBI ETF (6%) are stabilizers, but 16% isn\u2019t enough to offset stock-specific risk.\n- **Plan to Increase Nifty ETF & Gold**:\n  - **Nifty ETF**: Tracks Nifty 50, low volatility (~15-20% annualized), diversified across sectors. Increasing this (e.g., to 15-20%) balances your PSU tilt.\n  - **Gold**: Low correlation to stocks, hedges inflation. Boosting to 15% (from 10%) makes sense\u2014gold\u2019s uptrend in 2024 supports this.\n- **Suggestion**: Trim high-risk stocks (e.g., NTPC Green, Tata Motors\u2014your 9%+ bets) to fund ETFs. Aim for 20% Nifty ETF + 15% Gold (35% low-volatility assets).\n\n### My View on Your Portfolio\n- **Strengths**: Decent diversification (energy, finance, pharma, etc.), some defensive picks (ITC, Gold), PSU exposure taps government growth themes.\n- **Weaknesses**: \n  - Overweight PSUs (33%) at a volatile time\u2014your 20% loss likely stems from this correction.\n  - High single-stock bets (9-10% in Tata Motors, NTPC Green) amplify risk for a beginner.\n  - Wipro\u2019s underperformance is a weak link.\n- **Is Something Wrong?**: Not fundamentally\u2014your stocks aren\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d picks. The issue is timing (bought at peaks?) and allocation (too much in volatile segments).\n- **Normalcy**: A 20% drop in 8 months isn\u2019t rare for a stock-heavy portfolio in a corrective phase, but it\u2019s steeper than the market\u2014adjustments can help.\n\n\n### Recommendations\n1. **Rebalance**:\n   - Reduce NTPC Green, Tata Motors to 5-6% each.\n   - Exit or trim Wipro (swap for a stronger IT stock like Infosys if you want IT).\n   - Boost Nifty ETF to 15-20% and Gold Bees to 15%.\n2. **Hold Steady**: ITC, Dr. Reddy\u2019s, SBI, ONGC are solid\u2014don\u2019t panic-sell losses.\n3. **Learn Timing**: Use SIPs for ETFs to avoid buying at peaks.\n4. **Review**: Check your cost price vs. March 2025 levels\u2014share specifics if you want deeper analysis.",

I am not some kind of seller rather a fellow trader who want to build a community who can make money on both sides of trade instead getting emotionally attached to bull/bear side.\n\nShorting is 'smaller' event in trading and next potential shorting event is 2nd April.\n\n**So did you make money today considering the Friday fall?**",

What are your thoughts on this? Kindly guide me.\n\n\nPersonal context : I am 28, No loan in my name, been investing for 5 years so far, credit score is good (781+) and not doing any trading or other stuff.",

The stock has broken its support level and closed below it, signaling a bearish sentiment. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.\n\nAdditionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance. What is your opinion?",

But I wanted to get some insights from this community as to what you guys think \u2014 will paytm perform better in the coming months or should I take the 7% profit I have made and use the money to invest in other stocks (I have my eyes on Zomato, IOC, SBI, BEL, Tata Consumer & Tata steel)\n\nTIA",

When I say more, I mean I was expecting more profits from me but in such high volatility, I didn't give a single rupee in losses. Of course, I did make some bad decisions like IOC and LT but overall these were positive months. \n\nThis Q1 I made a 25.2% return on my capital. Umm, it's good, but it's lower than my past performances. I saw huge running losses this Q1 (first time) but thanks to the guidance from the universe and my knowledge so far, I escaped almost all of it and didn't have to book any. This is the highlight of this quarter.\n\nInteresting this is, that I joined the Reddit community this quarter only and have been enjoying the fun conversations here. Another highlight of the Q. \n\nAnyway, how did you all do and what were your learnings through this Q1? Ready for the next Q?",

But seeing how the market was going down decided to invest more and buy shares of BEL, GAIL and IOC. Please note that there is no fundamental analysis or technical anaylsis behind buying the shares. I just filtered the companies by market cap and then checked the price of each share. I wanted to buy atleast 10 shares of each company and had capital of only 6-7k so bought 10 shares of BEL, GAIL and IOC during end of Feb 2025. But seeing how BEL is performing I wish I had more capital to invest during the dip.",

Take this as goal of over the period of 3-4 months. Just focus on your increasing your  knowledge parallely about stock markets and investing and try to have as many conversations with your dad as possible. Calmly talk to him what he has to say, lot of times they just want their kids to listen to them and show that how much knowledge they have and also some validations. In between with the time make some smart points about the stocks and all as per your knowledge, as will follow this for some time, they will definitely notice that you are also having some knowledge around it and its okay to let you handle some things. And let me tell you, they also don\u2019t want to handle all of this by themselves, after all we have enough of stress to manage from other things in life. And most importantly, take a deep breath and try to keep yourself positive in these situations, the more good you will feel, the better you will be able to communicate. And at first try to make it like a collaboration first and then slowly build your presence in front of your father and eventually dominance with time. I hope this will help you :)",

Let\u2019s say you average 5% , that gives you roughly 12.5L per year or \\~1L per month.\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s before taxes and inflation. Plus, companies can skip dividends or pay less once in a while. So realistically, you\u2019d need closer to invest 3Cr in this hyper volatile market just to get that 1L per month and that\u2019s assuming the market isn\u2019t crashing when you retire.",

See i never add on single price when keep for near to 1 year or for the target of Rs 375 plus,  No one predicted at what price its opoen on monday because within a second we miss the opportunity so all order  i put between 9 to 9.06 am . this 20 rupees reduced the risk  when added in the parts or to say add if open on lower price  and estimated maximum downfall upto 8 % .

Here's how they work:\n\nDay: Orders placed with Day validity remain open for the order matching until they are executed or till the market closes.\n\nImmediate: Orders placed with Immediate or Cancel (IOC) validity allow a user to buy or sell a security as soon as the order is placed into the market. If the order is not executed, it gets auto-cancelled.\n\nMinutes: Orders placed with Minutes validity are auto-cancelled if the order is not executed in a given period in minutes.",

Additionally, I can manage to pay off my loan in a few months (maximum 4-5 months).\n\nI would appreciate your guidance on whether this is a good decision and any advice or suggestions you might have. \n\n\nI\u2019m planning to invest between October and December, and I intend to hold some investments until the U.S. election period and results. What are your thoughts on this? Kindly guide me.\n\n\n\nPersonal context : I am 28, No loan in my name, been investing for 5 years so far, credit score is good (781+) and not doing any trading or other stuff.",

        "selftext": "**Here's the good news!**\n\n1. Increased tariffs on products coming in from the People\u2019s Republic of China would increase the Market for Goods made in India.\n2. Trump's Pro-Fossil Fuel Policies may result in a decline in International crude oil prices benefitting Indian Oil Companies such as BPCL, IOC, and HPCL.\n3. The development of US industries may also lead to the emergence of more business opportunities in the US and India for some companies like ABB, Siemens, and Cummins.\n4. A more stable global environment under Trump could streamline supply chains, benefiting Indian companies like HAL and Bharat Dynamics.\n5. Business friendly measures especially cuts on taxes, lowering funding regulations and other policies to promote investment are some of the factors that induced the upward trend of the Indian equity market.\n\n**That's not it, We've some Bad News too!**\n\n1. An increase in interest rates in the US as well as reduced availability of cheap materials from the US supply base may cause inflation in India.\n2. A rise in the dollar may weaken several emerging market currencies, the Indian rupee included.\n3. Trump\u2019s unpredictable policies might promote some level of instability in the market which may result in losses for Indian investors.\n4. Already carried out restrictions on the issuance of H-1B visas restricted the growth of Indian IT companies and more of such policies can be anticipated in the future.\n5. Trump\u2019s comments on trade border measures by India may lead to aggravation of the current trade war with threats of even harsher measures.\n\nFor more such insights feel free to visit -\u00a0[https://x.com/Sahi\\_HQ](https://x.com/Sahi_HQ)",
