They sell novel products, household name...fevi stock, fevikwik, dr fixit etc.  and cheaply available at ...any kiryana, stationery shop. ( Fevikwik Rs. 5/-) \n\nDespite the high PE, I believe it's evergreen and has many trade secrets so the business can't be copied to a very great extent and will have monopoly for a long time. \nThe underlying business is good : \nOperating profit margin increasing steadily Y.O.Y. \n1000 cr sales increasing Y.O.Y. \nDebt Free \nEPS increasing Y.O.Y. \nSpending wisely on Fixed assets. \nDisposing laggard fixed assets. \nManagement is initiated and responsive. \n\nOverall good company.

The stock has been consolidating within a range of \u20b92700-\u20b93500 for the last three years.  \n2. The PE ratio is reasonable for such a market leader.  \n3. A well-defined channel has formed, presenting swing trade opportunities with a potential 25-35% return.\n\n**Financials:**  \n1. Revenue and net profit have grown significantly over the last three years.  \n2. Reserves have been steadily increasing.  \n3. The rise in fixed assets and CWIP indicates ongoing expansion efforts.\n\n**News:**  \n1. Expansion: The company is diversifying beyond paints into home d\u00e9cor, furniture, kitchens, and more.  \n2. Acquisitions: They recently acquired Nanova to venture into nano-coating technology. Although it\u2019s a small investment, it reflects the management\u2019s innovative mindset.  \n3. With crude oil prices dropping, the paint industry stands to benefit, as crude oil is a major raw material.  \n  \n*This analysis is for educational purposes only and is not intended as a buy/sell recommendation.*\n\n",

I think that maybe making some sense also in paying debt rather than using reserves.\n\nThat is all I know and can say on this.

        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

                "body": "I started my analysis with Reliance Industries\u2019 announcement that it is selling its 4.9% stake in Asian Paints, a stake it has held for 17 years since buying it in January 2008 for \u20b9500 crore, as reported by Economic Times (May 2025). This stake is now worth \u20b911,141 crore, based on Asian Paints\u2019 closing price of \u20b92,323 on May 13, 2025. This means Reliance is making a 24 times return on its original investment. The sale is being managed by Bank of America and is part of Reliance\u2019s broader plan to focus more on its core businesses, especially Jio (its telecom arm) and its green energy ventures. The decision also comes at a time when competition in the paints industry is rising.\n\nI looked into the financial journey of this stake over the years. The \u20b9500 crore investment grew significantly due to Asian Paints\u2019 strong stock performance over time. But recently, the stock has seen a sharp decline. In the past year alone, it has dropped 19.3% from its 52-week high of \u20b93,394, which was recorded on September 16, 2024. This fall has wiped off about \u20b951,000 crore from Asian Paints\u2019 market value, which reflects the broader stress in the market.\n\nI explored the competitive environment that\u2019s affecting Asian Paints. I found that its market share has dropped from 59% in FY24 to 52% in FY25. A major reason is the entry of Grasim Industries\u2019 new paint brand, Birla Opus, which quickly gained 3\u20134% market share in just the third quarter of FY25. Birla Opus is growing fast by using aggressive pricing, heavy advertising, and offering cashback incentives to painters. Industry insiders believe Birla Opus is aiming to reach \u20b910,000 crore in revenue within the next three years, which could shake up the market even more. On top of that, Asian Paints is also facing margin pressures due to rising crude oil prices, which affect the cost of raw materials. Reports suggest that if Grasim continues to grow at this pace and reaches a high single-digit market share, Asian Paints\u2019 share among the top nine paint companies might slip further to 50% by the end of FY25. This would make Birla Opus the fourth-largest player in the sector.\n\nI also looked at Asian Paints\u2019 performance during this challenging time. In Q2 of FY25, the company reported a 31.3% increase in net profit compared to the same quarter last year, reaching \u20b9780 crore. Revenue also grew by 19% to \u20b98,460 crore. This shows that the company is still growing, but its stock performance has been weak because of pressure across the industry. Other major players like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac have also seen big declines of around 24% in 2022. Even though Asian Paints has faced recent setbacks, its total market cap remains strong at \u20b9222,975 crore. However, it is currently trading at 11.5 times its book value, and its sales growth over the last five years has been a modest 10.9%. Its promoter holding stands at 52.6%, which suggests that those running the company still have faith in its future.\n\nTo understand the company\u2019s long-term outlook, I looked at its strengths. Despite the recent dip in stock price and growing competition, Asian Paints still has strong fundamentals. It has a wide distribution network and is known for constantly bringing innovation to its products. These strengths could help the company recover and grow in the long run. The paint sector as a whole is currently facing pricing pressure and slow volume growth, especially in the decorative segment where new players like Grasim are disrupting the market. But many industry experts believe that Asian Paints, with its experience and ability to adapt, could eventually regain lost ground through better products and stronger value offerings.\n\nIn summary, Reliance Industries is selling its 4.9% stake in Asian Paints for \u20b911,141 crore, which was originally bought for \u20b9500 crore in 2008, marking a 24-fold gain. The sale is part of Reliance\u2019s move to focus more on telecom and green energy. Meanwhile, Asian Paints is facing growing competition from new players like Birla Opus, which has caused its market share to drop from 59% to 52%. Its stock is also down 19.3% in the last year, leading to a \u20b951,000 crore fall in market value. Despite these issues, Asian Paints posted strong profit and revenue growth in Q2 FY25 and still has a solid foundation for future growth.\n\nIf you like my work then please support my subreddit as well.

You dont make money for 2-4 years if you pay high multiples of 60-70 even if earnings are compounding at decent pace because of mean reversion and pe compression. Arctic fundamentals are growing but the pe is compressing.\n\nCochin just get rid of it because the growth of next 5 years is already factored in the stock and a compression on multiple can drag it down 20-40%\n\nasian paints long term is fine, but dont average it before the multiples reaches on 30-35 range, its still expensive given the slowdown in consumption and the pace at which its growing.\n\nJIO 100 PE, you wont make  money on such multiples, and margin of safety is zero, one bad execution or news and you can see the stock crashing.,\n\nSail Is shit company just get out of it and allocate to high quality compounders.\n\nSharda motors is growing earnings and the valuations are not expensive so you can hold that one. \n\nAdani Wilmar, well the revenue have remain stagnant for past 4 years and increase in profit was due to financial act of increasing the other income.Its not a high quality company plus there margin profile is weak. Move to better companies who's management you can trust, plus always look at margin profile.\n\n  \nIf you want any further help you can DM. \n\nAlways screen your stocks through a high quality checklist before investing and never overpay.\n\nOne basic issue with your portfolio is that you overpaid for growth and purchased most of stock at 60-80PE, you must have probably came during covid and don't have basic understanding about how markets will behave in long term and how mean reversion destroys wealth.",

Instead of waiting for recovery, utilize basic short-selling strategies.\n2. **Short Selling Strategy for Futures**\n   * Identify stocks that are trending\u00a0**down**\u00a0on a weekly timeframe.\n   * On the daily timeframe, look for stocks where the\u00a0**RSI (Relative Strength Index)**\u00a0is above 70, indicating they are overbought.\n   * Enter a short position in futures, as the bias aligns with the downward trend.\n3. **Intraday Short Selling Strategy**\n   * Use the\u00a0**ADX (Average Directional Index)**\u00a0to confirm trends.\n   * Look for stocks trending\u00a0**down**\u00a0on the daily chart, but with\u00a0**RSI above 70**\u00a0(overbought) on the hourly chart.\n   * Enter short positions with even lots, set a desired stop-loss amount, and manage your position as follows:\n      * Once the trade turns profitable, sell half the quantity equivalent to your stop-loss amount.\n      * Let the remaining trade ride until the end of the day.\n4. **Why Focus on Shorting in a Bear Market?**\n   * This is an ideal bear market where\u00a0**FIIs (Foreign Institutional Investors)**\u00a0are consistently shorting.\n   * There are\u00a0**no strong reasons**\u00a0to expect a market recovery anytime soon.",

Had started with investing approx 25K in Adani enterprises as a bet for 2024 elections, but sold it in just one month with 500 rupees profit (could not handle the volatility), but by that time I had started getting interested in the basics of fundamental and technical analysis. I am not from a finance background but I am still trying my best to understand the concepts of finance (ROE, ROCE, ROA, cash flow statement, debt to equity etc.) mostly from YouTube channels (Basant Maheshwari, Invest in Bharat, etc). These are my stock picks in past 1 year. I would love to hear your views on my portfolio. The stocks did not perform well for the most of the year, and I was afraid that I won't even beat FD returns, however after election results things are changing for the better. My goal is to slowly concentrate the portfolio by reducing the companies to 9-10 in the next 3 years and keep investing for long term gains. ",

Year-to-date, it has lost nearly 25 percent, underperforming the Nifty 50, which has risen 10 percent in the same period.\r\rJPMorgan downgraded Asian Paints to 'Underweight', cutting its target price to Rs 2,400 from Rs 2,800 due to the company's significant operating miss. The company's profit-before-depreciation, interest, and tax (PBDIT) margin dropped to 15.5 percent in Q2FY25 from 20.3 percent the previous year. CEO Amit Syngle said, \"Operating margins were impacted by the price reductions taken last year, higher material prices and increased sales expenses.\"",
