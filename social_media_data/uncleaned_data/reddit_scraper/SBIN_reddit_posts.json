Still would call myself that but have taken positions in some not-large-cap companies in the last 1 year.\n\nI have 75 stocks in my portfolio but have include 42 in the screenshot below with a sizeable position > 75k\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xgaatvhmth1e1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=35045a22f776a0cac3c1bff5137565b6fdd7a356\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w87tamhmth1e1.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=17c5aa1587c2ade76f226afcd3bc5a8d91a48fe3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yhfpmuhmth1e1.png?width=983&format=png&auto=webp&s=71ccc8081f09364fe7362f17b51a9b6ea559fbb9\n\nRationale for the top holdings\n\n1. HDFC Bank: Biggest private sector bank with a focus on retail and growing in Tier-2/3 cities. We are 1 stock market crash away from HDFC Bank rallying. Irony?\n2. Angel One: Growing the second fastest in brokers. Fairly valued as compared to Groww but overvalued as compare to Zerodha. Reference Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gb1r0m/want\\_to\\_go\\_yolo\\_on\\_angel\\_one/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gb1r0m/want_to_go_yolo_on_angel_one/)\n3. INFY/HCL/Wipro: Most of my positions are more than 2 years old. Now, you can call it Betting on Trump\n4. IRFC: Got lucky. Bought at a decent valuation when the stock was 25. Sold 1/3 position at 125 and still hold the remaining 2/3 of the position. Will let it play out because if India needs to move at scale, railways need to be better and more common. Railways get their funding from IRFC.\n5. Amara Raja: Betting on a reputed battery company with the most reliable battery brand (Amron). Bought it at decent valuations around 2 years back\n6. Divis/Dr. Reddy/NH/Lal Pathlabs: Consumer companies in an economy where focus on healthcare is expected to grow\n\nIf you want my reasons for any other stock, just comment. \n\nIn which stocks do you think I can increase my position? For which stocks you think the reward outweigh the risk? Share your thoughts in the comments below. We can discuss and can make/save money together $$",

I know people talk about diversifying your portfolio, and also it's best to buy a significant quantity of a stock for optimal gains. Should I buy multiple stocks lets say 3 stocks for 15k each or should I buy maybe a single one for 30k and maybe something else for 15k. \n\nI have tata motors, ongc, sbin, and bandhan bank in my portfolio. But the portfolio itself is just 1.2 lakhs as of now. Bought tata motors at 960, bandhan bank at 202, ONGC at 290 and SBIN at 785. Portfolio is in profit but I wonder, if I would be adding more into these stocks in the future or invest in new ones. \n\nIt would be great help if anyone could share some advice. ",

        "selftext": "The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the\u00a0**Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

I would appreciate your feedback on it. When I test the strategy in TradingView's Strategy Tester, it delivers exceptional results for certain stocks (e.g., SBIN, as shown below). However, I'm unsure about the long-term viability of the strategy. Could I be interpreting something incorrectly? I would greatly appreciate your insights.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wsddzv2xwhtd1.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&s=0353393acab4d2a92930bc9a2a070c8ffd6ac7e9\n\nPine Script --\n\n    //@version=4\n    strategy(\"Simple Intraday Trading System\", overlay=true)\n    \n    // User Inputs\n    ema1 = input(title=\"Fast EMA\", type=input.integer, defval=5, minval=1, maxval=200)\n    ema2 = input(title=\"Slow EMA\", type=input.integer, defval=10, minval=1, maxval=200)\n    TradeTime = input(title=\"Trade Timings\", defval=\"0930-1500\", type=input.session)\n    SqoffTime = input(title=\"Squareoff Timings\", defval=\"1515-1530\", type=input.session)\n    stop = input(title=\"Stoploss (Points)\", type=input.integer, defval=30, minval=1, maxval=1000, step=0.05)\n    target = input(title=\"Target (Points)\", type=input.integer, defval=20, minval=1, maxval=1000, step=0.05)\n    displayema = input(title=\"Display EMA\", type=input.bool, defval=true)\n    \n    // Helper function to detect the trading session\n    Barsinsession(TradeTime) => time(timeframe.period, TradeTime) != 0\n    \n    // Session variables\n    Insession = Barsinsession(TradeTime) ? 1 : 0\n    endofsession = Insession == 0 and Insession[1] == 1  \n    Sqsession = Barsinsession(SqoffTime) ? 1 : 0\n    SqTime = Sqsession == 1 and Sqsession[1] == 0\n    \n    // Buy and Sell conditions based on EMA crossover and session timing\n    Buy = crossover(ema(close, ema1), ema(close, ema2)) and Insession\n    Sell = (crossunder(ema(close, ema1), ema(close, ema2)) and Insession) or SqTime\n    \n    // Calculate entry price, stop loss, and target price\n    BuyPrice = valuewhen(Buy, close, 0)\n    targetprice = BuyPrice + target\n    stopprice = BuyPrice - stop\n    \n    // Exit conditions\n    emacrossexit = crossunder(ema(close, 20), ema(close, 50))\n    Targethit = crossover(high, targetprice)\n    Stophit = crossunder(low, stopprice)\n    Sell := Sell or Targethit or Stophit\n    \n    // Logic to manage buy/sell status\n    var bool isLong = false\n    var bool isSell = false\n    \n    Buy := not isLong and Buy\n    Sell := not isSell and Sell\n    \n    if Buy\n        isLong := true\n        isSell := false\n    \n    if Sell\n        isLong := false\n        isSell := true\n    \n    // Flip to continue buy or sell positions\n    buycontinue = barssince(Buy) < barssince(Sell)\n    sellcontinue = barssince(Sell) < barssince(Buy)\n    \n    // Plot buy/sell signals\n    plot(buycontinue ? targetprice : na, color=color.blue, style=plot.style_circles, linewidth=1)\n    plot(buycontinue ? stopprice : na, color=color.red, style=plot.style_circles, linewidth=1)\n    \n    // Visual signals\n    plotshape(Buy, style=shape.labelup, location=location.belowbar, color=color.green, title=\"Buy\", text=\"Buy\", textcolor=color.white)\n    plotshape(Sell and not SqTime and not Targethit and not Stophit, style=shape.labeldown, location=location.abovebar, color=color.red, title=\"Sell\", text=\"Sell\", textcolor=color.white)\n    plotshape(Sell and SqTime and not Targethit and not Stophit, style=shape.labeldown, location=location.abovebar, color=color.orange, title=\"Squareoff.Exit\", text=\"Squareoff.Exit\", textcolor=color.white)\n    plotshape(Sell and not SqTime and Targethit and not Stophit, style=shape.labeldown, location=location.abovebar, color=color.blue, title=\"Sell\", text=\"Target.Exit\", textcolor=color.white)\n    plotshape(Sell and not SqTime and not Targethit and Stophit, style=shape.labeldown, location=location.abovebar, color=color.red, title=\"Squareoff.Exit\", text=\"Stop.Exit\", textcolor=color.white)\n    \n    // Plot EMAs\n    plot(displayema ? ema(close, ema1) : na, color=color.aqua, style=plot.style_line, linewidth=1)\n    plot(displayema ? ema(close, ema2) : na, color=color.lime, style=plot.style_line, linewidth=1)\n    \n    // Strategy Entries and Exits\n    if (Buy)\n        strategy.entry(\"Buy\", strategy.long, stop=BuyPrice)\n    \n    if (Sell or Targethit or Stophit)\n        strategy.exit(\"Sell\", \"Buy\", limit=targetprice, stop=stopprice)",

        "selftext": "(Warning: Long Post)\n\nI'm 22 M, graduated college recently, and I've recently started to learn about the Stock Market and Mutual Funds. I learned Fundamental Analysis using Zerodha Varsity, and I'm also constantly reading up on investment basics, strategies, considerations, etc.\n\nMy parents are financially very strong, and gave me 12L to put in mutual funds (I will eventually pay the 12L back). After discussing with a friend of theirs who works at Nuvama Investments, I have invested this amount in a mixture of large, mid, and Flexicap funds and some debt funds. I'm expecting good returns from them in the next 3-5 years.\n\nNow, I had around 2.4 L left from a mixture of my internship savings and the money left in my account for my college expenses). My parents encouraged me to start investing in stocks, given I had already done a bit of research. \n\nI used Screener to filter out some stocks for the long term using some metrics, then did some research on the company to find out the current market and investor sentiment before finally investing in it. I have also identified the major sectors that are going to grow in the next 5 years: Infra, PSU Banks, Defence, Railways, and Oil and Gas. Based on all this,  this is my portfolio right now:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ma5z40ix48d1.png?width=1267&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f9ef46d6151deee483f35aa62529ad8153323ae\n\nHAL, BEL, and other Defense stocks seemed to be on a bullish run, and the sentiment about Defense stocks was that they were going to increase a lot. But HAL and BEL dropped a lot these past two days, and what doesn't help is that I've been seeing a lot of news recently about the markets being at an all-time high and some impending corrections coming soon. I was planning to invest in other Defense stocks as well (MAZDOCK, Cochin shipyard, and Paras Defense) but I'm not sure whether right now is a good time to enter these. \n\nI would love to hear some advice about my portfolio in general. I plan to hold most of them for the long term (3-5 years). I think I have bought too much SBI, I plan to sell half of it at a profit and invest in some other stocks. Some stocks on my watchlist are Railway (IRFC, IRCON, and RVNL), Sun Pharma (Very Strong Financials for the Long Term), and Tata Motors (I've seen People Recommend this stock a lot).\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on these. Also, I'll start earning soon (around \\~1.4L per month post taxes) and I plan to also invest a bit in small-cap MFs, some Debt Instruments, and FDs. I live at home and have negligible monthly expenses, so I'm planning to invest most of my monthly income.\n\n\n\n  \n",

Recently, friends advised that having too many MF SIPs can be problematic. They mentioned that the investment amount shouldn't change, but the number of MFs should be fewer. I didn't fully understand this. Are they right? If so, why? Also, if I need to reduce the number of MFs, which SIPs should I keep and which should I let go?\n\n2. **Should I invest less in SIPs and more in stocks?**\n\nI'm 29, and my friends say my risk appetite is higher. However, I prefer long-term investments and don't have the time or expertise to buy/sell stocks regularly. Am I making a mistake by focusing more on SIPs? Should I allocate more to stocks?\n\n3. **Should I consider an SWP?**\n\n4. I have 10 lacs to invest now. Any suggestions on how to allocate this based on my current portfolio?\n\nSorry for the many questions, but I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!",

I don't think multiple ELSS Tax Saver funds are required. Just keep 1 from each category. The reason for not keeping multiple MF's is, different expense ratios can keep eating into your profits.\n2. If you don't have time to analyse and buy/sell stocks, you can continue with your SIP, no problem in that. You mentioned that you are picking stocks based on your friend's suggestions, and that can go horribly wrong. It's your life and your financial goals, so you can take the call about which way you want to go. Nothing wrong with either.",

After breaking the support, the stock has been consolidating and forming a flag-and-pole-like pattern on the daily chart, which is a trend continuation pattern. If it breaks the support of this pattern, further downside is likely. The RMI has not yet given a sell signal, but it is on the verge of a bearish crossover. Looking at the open interest (OI) buildup, market sentiment also appears negative. Since December 2024, the market has been driven down by heavy short positions. Now, with OI increasing again alongside a decline in price, fresh short buildup is evident. If SBIN's Q3 results are negative, it would align with the price action and could push the stock even lower.   \nDisclaimer: I am not SEBI registered and I do not hold any position in the stock, Just sharing my observation.",

You dont make money for 2-4 years if you pay high multiples of 60-70 even if earnings are compounding at decent pace because of mean reversion and pe compression. Arctic fundamentals are growing but the pe is compressing.\n\nCochin just get rid of it because the growth of next 5 years is already factored in the stock and a compression on multiple can drag it down 20-40%\n\nasian paints long term is fine, but dont average it before the multiples reaches on 30-35 range, its still expensive given the slowdown in consumption and the pace at which its growing.\n\nJIO 100 PE, you wont make  money on such multiples, and margin of safety is zero, one bad execution or news and you can see the stock crashing.,\n\nSail Is shit company just get out of it and allocate to high quality compounders.\n\nSharda motors is growing earnings and the valuations are not expensive so you can hold that one. \n\nAdani Wilmar, well the revenue have remain stagnant for past 4 years and increase in profit was due to financial act of increasing the other income.Its not a high quality company plus there margin profile is weak. Move to better companies who's management you can trust, plus always look at margin profile.\n\n  \nIf you want any further help you can DM. \n\nAlways screen your stocks through a high quality checklist before investing and never overpay.\n\nOne basic issue with your portfolio is that you overpaid for growth and purchased most of stock at 60-80PE, you must have probably came during covid and don't have basic understanding about how markets will behave in long term and how mean reversion destroys wealth.",

So in terms of value investing, not a good bet as the debt will only increase if they wish to sustain. Anyway, you might be having your own philosophy, so good luck with that.\n\n2. SBI is a good and safe bet. It'll fetch u dividend and safe returns to just beat inflation. You however will have to keep your expectations low from SBI in terms of returns.\n\n3. No idea about SEPC but seems to create a good balance as one should have a small cap/mid cap in order to create a fortune. How big the companies in which you get early get decides the fortune you'll make hence have midcap/smallcaps from relevant sectors.\n\nBest of luck keep going!",

        "selftext": "Net profit dropped 10% in the Jan-March quarter (\u20b918,643 crore vs \u20b920,698 crore last year). Consolidated profit also down 8% to \u20b919,600 crore.\n\nHere's the good part:  \n1. Income jumped to \u20b91.43 lakh crore (standalone) and \u20b91.79 lakh crore (consolidated).  \n2. They're giving a dividend of \u20b915.90/ share.  \n3. Full year profit up 16% to \u20b970,901 crore (that's the big picture).  \n4. Bad loans (NPAs) down significantly: gross NPAs at 1.82% (from 2.24%) and net NPAs at 0.47%\n\nSo what does this mean? SBI had one slightly weaker quarter but their yearly performance is strong. The asset quality improvement is a BIG deal, the bank is getting healthier.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Gap up, gap down, or flat opening tomorrow?",

Price moved above the neckline indicating the breakout of pattern. \n\nI am expecting to reach 840 as first target where it faces resistance. If we can break that trendline and hold, then we can see it going towards 860 where it faces another resistance(looking at left on chart shows you candles rejecting this level). If we can sustain above 860 then 900 we go. \n\nTrade plan needs to be revised based on stock reaction at those levels.",

After breaking the support, the stock has been consolidating and forming a flag-and-pole-like pattern on the daily chart, which is a trend continuation pattern. If it breaks the support of this pattern, further downside is likely. The RMI has not yet given a sell signal, but it is on the verge of a bearish crossover. Looking at the open interest (OI) buildup, market sentiment also appears negative. Since December 2024, the market has been driven down by heavy short positions. Now, with OI increasing again alongside a decline in price, fresh short buildup is evident. If SBIN's Q3 results are negative, it would align with the price action and could push the stock even lower. \n\nDisclaimer: I am not SEBI registered and I do not hold any position in the stock, Just sharing my observation.",

Basis experience so far in the markets, can't find value anywhere currently. Holding 2.5L in cash for any correction.\n\nRight move at this point seems to diversify away from equities. However, overall debt portfolio also is sizeable and it doesn't seem wise to add to it considering taxes and inflation. Hence have zeroed down on land or real estate as the next investment vehicle. However, ticket size is huge, which is why I feel I am caught in a long waiting game.\n\nMedium term strategy for equities is to keep building the cash position waiting for prices to cool down (US elections, interest rate move maybe) and to build a safety shell around equity portfolio so that it needn't be touched and can keep growing at whatever rate.\n\nThoughts? Anyone else thinking similarly?",
