        "selftext": "\n\nThe share prices of OMCs have fallen significantly from their all-time highs, making their valuations very attractive.\nThese stocks are trading at lower P/E ratios compared to their historical averages and other high-growth sectors.\nCrude Oil Outlook Favors OMCs\n\nWith Trump in power and his push to boost U.S. crude oil production, global oil prices are unlikely to surge.\nA stable crude price range of $65-$75 will help OMCs maintain refining margins and reduce earnings volatility.\nUnder-Recoveries & Government Support\n\nOMCs are currently facing under-recoveries on LPG sales, estimated at \u20b930,000 crore.\nThe government has already provided \u20b912,000 crore in subsidies, and additional support is expected, which will directly improve their financials.\nGovernment Backing & Policy Support\n\nThe government holds a majority stake in all three OMCs, ensuring long-term stability and financial backing.\nOil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has been praising the financial performance of OMCs, signaling continued government confidence in the sector.\nThe disinvestment of BPCL was scrapped, indicating that the government sees growth potential in oil marketing companies.\nHigh Dividend Yield \u2013 A Major Advantage\n\nOMCs offer strong dividend yields of 6-9%, which are comparable to fixed deposit (FD) returns.\nThis makes them an attractive investment for long-term investors looking for stable returns along with potential capital appreciation.\nBetter Value Compared to Overvalued Stocks\n\nInstead of chasing high P/E stocks like Zomato, Dixon, and Trent, investors should focus on OMCs, which offer a much better risk-reward ratio.\nThese stocks provide gradual wealth generation along with yearly dividends, making them a solid choice for long-term portfolios.",

        "selftext": "I have observed that dividend investing is almost considered a dirty word in this sub. The reasons are fair enough, with dividend being taxed as income from additional sources, making it less efficient than capital gains.\n\nThat being said, I'm one of the few old fashioned investors who like a steady cashflow over time, and eventually plan to retire and live off my dividends.\n\nGiven market upswings and downturns, dividend investing can give one some degree of mental peace. Investing in dividend value generators, especially during market downturns, can lead to situations down the line where your dividend income per share is greater than the price of the stock (Eg: CPCL).\n\nThis sub comprises of people chasing high growth, exciting stocks at extremely high PEs, often in triple digits. I want to know how many of you invest in unglamorous and low PE stocks like PFC, seeking steady dividend growth over time rather than high risk, high reward trades.",

        "selftext": "Jio Financial Services Limited (JFSL) was listed in August 2023 after being demerged from Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) to unlock the value of RIL\u2019s financial services business.\n\nJFSL formed a joint venture with BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset management company. Both parties committed to investing $300 million (\u20b92,500 crore) each as an initial investment to build a \u201cdigital-first asset management business.\u201d\n\nAll of this seems promising, but what exactly is Jio Finance trying to become? As of now, only \u20b9117 crore has been invested in JFSL, with more to come over the next several years. It is currently expanding into multiple sectors:\n\n1. Asset & Wealth Management.\n\n\t\tSEBI has approved JFSL to launch its first mutual fund in 2025.\n\n2. Lending & Credit Services.\n\n\t\tPlans to offer consumer loans, SME financing, and secured loans.\n\n3. Insurance.\n\n\t\tExploring potential entry into life, health, and general insurance with a digital-first approach.\n\n4. Payments & Banking. \n\n\t    Jio Payments Bank, a joint venture with SBI, is already operational, offering UPI and banking services.\n\n5. Stock Broking & Advisory.\n\n\t      Launched Jio BlackRock Broking Private Limited to offer stock trading and advisory services.\n\n6. NBFC.\n\n\t\tJFSL has NBFC status, allowing it to lend directly without being a bank.\n\t\tExpected to enter housing finance, auto loans, and SME loans.\n\nHere's where the real uncertainty comes. JFSL is in every sector and no doubt might disrupt this too being a conglomerate but a company like jio which is barely operational is replacing Bharat Petroleum a well established company\n\nWhile JFSL is expanding aggressively, its business strategy lacks clear direction.\n\nJFSL holds a 6.1% stake in Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). With RIL\u2019s current market cap at \u20b917.4 lakh crore, JFSL\u2019s stake alone is worth nearly \u20b91.4 lakh crore.\n\nHowever, JFSL\u2019s own market cap was initially just \u20b920,000 crore, which means that its valuation was massively inflated due to its RIL stake, rather than its core financial services business.\n\nJFSL is trying to enter every financial sector at once, asset management, broking, lending, payments, insurance, NBFC, and fintech instead of focusing on one vertical and expanding from there\n\nEven its Jio BlackRock AMC got SEBI approval, yet the mutual fund is still not operational, and its revenues, profits, and assets remain uncertain and nothing is sure about the company's balance sheet yet about what's happening.\n\n\nAdded to Nifty 50 But Does It Deserve It?\n\nDespite its lack of execution, JFSL will be added to the Nifty 50 on March 28, 2025, replacing BPCL.\n\nZomato will replace Britannia in the same reshuffle, might make a post on it later.\n\nJFSL\u2019s inclusion is primarily based on its free-float market capitalization, not its financial performance.\n\nIt recently corrected due to overvaluation. Despite holding only 6.1% of RIL, it was given an inflated market cap and is now being added to Nifty 50.\n\n\nJio Financial Services just seems to me like a reliance backed company without any plans in the near future just going into every sector possible but at this point the company just seems too new to be added to the nifty 50, what are your thoughts?",

Reliance Power\u2019s higher liquidity and catalyst scores may appeal to investors seeking assets that can adapt quickly under changing market conditions. In contrast, Hindustan Petroleum\u2019s superior EMI, STOI, and LTSS suggest it may provide a more stable investment for those with a long-term, risk-averse perspective.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nReliance Power Limited stands out based on liquidity, catalyst strength, and risk-adjusted performance improvements. This data-driven recommendation is supported by a balanced integration of quantitative metrics and qualitative insights, ultimately framing Reliance Power Limited as the more strategically attractive investment under current market conditions.

        "selftext": "Do you invest in high dividend yield companies?   \n  \nI see a lot of investors buying stocks, which have high dividend yields, with the argument that dividend would be as good as investing in fixed deposit and capital appreciation would be a bonus.  \n  \nWell I feel there's a problem with companies giving high dividends in India due to our tax structure, we pay double taxes on dividends.  \n  \nSo just suppose, your company has a profit before tax of 100 rupees, with a corporate tax rate of 25% (Yes individuals pay more taxes than corporate), company's PAT(Profit after tax) would be 75 rupees and if you get this 75 rupees as dividend you will pay again 30% taxes(UHNIs would be paying even higher taxes) the money received by you finally would be \\~52.5 rupees. So out of the 100 rupees pre-tax, government keeps \\~47.5 rupees. This may be okay for the companies where government owns majority of the stake(because the tax is also going to government ). But for a private company giving \\~INR 48 to \\~INR 50 to government is only possible if company doesn't see any growth opportunity.  \n  \nSo don't buy the stocks just because the dividend yield is high, the company's paying high dividend only making the government rich.",

Should I invest more (I have approximately 50k cash available)? Or should I just hold and not take any action?",

See i never add on single price when keep for near to 1 year or for the target of Rs 375 plus,  No one predicted at what price its opoen on monday because within a second we miss the opportunity so all order  i put between 9 to 9.06 am . this 20 rupees reduced the risk  when added in the parts or to say add if open on lower price  and estimated maximum downfall upto 8 % .

So your one year plan may not work, if you dont like that idea you should sell and cut losses or stay and be patient.\nJust know tata is actually a perfectly valued stock at the moment compared to its peers.",

You dont make money for 2-4 years if you pay high multiples of 60-70 even if earnings are compounding at decent pace because of mean reversion and pe compression. Arctic fundamentals are growing but the pe is compressing.\n\nCochin just get rid of it because the growth of next 5 years is already factored in the stock and a compression on multiple can drag it down 20-40%\n\nasian paints long term is fine, but dont average it before the multiples reaches on 30-35 range, its still expensive given the slowdown in consumption and the pace at which its growing.\n\nJIO 100 PE, you wont make  money on such multiples, and margin of safety is zero, one bad execution or news and you can see the stock crashing.,\n\nSail Is shit company just get out of it and allocate to high quality compounders.\n\nSharda motors is growing earnings and the valuations are not expensive so you can hold that one. \n\nAdani Wilmar, well the revenue have remain stagnant for past 4 years and increase in profit was due to financial act of increasing the other income.Its not a high quality company plus there margin profile is weak. Move to better companies who's management you can trust, plus always look at margin profile.\n\n  \nIf you want any further help you can DM. \n\nAlways screen your stocks through a high quality checklist before investing and never overpay.\n\nOne basic issue with your portfolio is that you overpaid for growth and purchased most of stock at 60-80PE, you must have probably came during covid and don't have basic understanding about how markets will behave in long term and how mean reversion destroys wealth.",

If you will overpay and buy stocks at such valuations you will have to see negative returns and waiting period of 3-5 years. \n\nIndia mart is also going through same stages, \n\nsince 2021 EPS has almost moved up 100%, but because the PE compressed from 100 to 30 you are seeing negative returns.\n\nlong term its a compounding high quality business, but 100PE any stock cannot sustain for long and they will revert to mean. same happened with asian paints and will happen with all the stocks trading at ridiculous valuations and growing earnings at 10-15%.\n\nAlkyl Amines is a commodity business and lack pricing power, Saurabh mukhaejea marketed it and people went for it at 100-120 PE. \n\nso its a learning lesson.\n\n  \nyou can just read Peter Lynch one up the Wall Street and Terry smith investing for growth and it will help avoid these basic mistakes.",

Zomato? I mean Zomato sounded promising but then about the quarterly results plus the PE is sky high, would it make sense to still keep it I m looking for long term cuz ik it would take years to get some reasonable experience. Would appreciate everyone's piece of knowledge \n\nI have attached my mf portfolio and I checked the overlap, didn't find much\nAnd all the money was just my freelanced income(developer), I kept some for myself in bank\n\nI also invest in crypto but that's just about 69$ , not planning on adding more to crypto (it's more of a gamble than an investment lol but I invest in good coins like solana and bitcoin and Ethereum + some meme coins like doge + ai coins like act)\n\nPlan on adding to stocks and mf every month/week depending on how much I earn via freelancing (18.9 years age)\n\n*Is tata motors something I should keep my eye on*\n\nMy main goal is to be smart and add on to this portfolio via increasing my income by upskilling myself and studying, all the while freelancing without hinderencing my academics much\n\nThanks for your words and advices in advance :)",

In the MF space, continue SIPs in the Parag Parikh Fund but revisit the rationale behind selecting the other two funds.\n2. Your stock portfolio is concentrated in high-risk, cyclical, and speculative stocks. Stocks make up \\~10.5% of your portfolio, while mutual funds account for \\~89.5%. \n3. Add some defensive stocks to balance risk.\n4. Make sure you have an emergency fund and adequate insurance before allocating more to risky assets.",

What stocks would u suggest for balancing the risk? Relience? Kpit? Motilal fin?\n4. I m a student but still kept a decent chunk in bank for peace of mind, idk about insurance, I think I have health insurance but it was made by my parents, and I plan on diversifying to other assets as well like gold and ppfas stuff and fd because as u said need some amount with safety , but after I have enough capital that it's worth diversifying so much \n\nThanks for ur experience. :)",

Separately, of course, I have a personal equity portfolio as well \u2014 in that, I have been investing ~40% of my capital based on momentum factor for the past couple of years and that has beat the broader market indices by a decent margin. \n\nBeginning today, in this thread, I\u2019ll post top 10 stocks from Nifty50 which are currently experiencing high momentum. I\u2019ll update this list on a weekly basis. \n\nIf I see interest in these lists, I\u2019ll post high momentum stocks from small- and mid-caps as well. I have a couple of smallcases as well (freely available) that are also based on momentum tracking. These have given 79% and 20% returns in the past 14 months and 4 months, respectively. \n\nDisclaimer: THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE. I\u2019M NOT A SEBI REGISTERED ENTITY. I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE PERSONAL POSITIONS IN SOME OF THESE STOCKS. THIS IS ALL FOR EDUCATIONAL DISCUSSION ONLY.",

Naturally, that made me wonder \u2014 **could this be a good time to invest in Indian oil companies like HPCL, BPCL, or IOCL?**\n\nHere\u2019s my reasoning:\n\n* In India, **retail fuel prices (petrol/diesel)** often don\u2019t drop when global crude prices fall.\n* That means oil marketing companies (OMCs) might **enjoy higher margins** \u2014 they\u2019re buying cheaper but selling at the same old price.",

        "selftext": "**Here's the good news!**\n\n1. Increased tariffs on products coming in from the People\u2019s Republic of China would increase the Market for Goods made in India.\n2. Trump's Pro-Fossil Fuel Policies may result in a decline in International crude oil prices benefitting Indian Oil Companies such as BPCL, IOC, and HPCL.\n3. The development of US industries may also lead to the emergence of more business opportunities in the US and India for some companies like ABB, Siemens, and Cummins.\n4. A more stable global environment under Trump could streamline supply chains, benefiting Indian companies like HAL and Bharat Dynamics.\n5. Business friendly measures especially cuts on taxes, lowering funding regulations and other policies to promote investment are some of the factors that induced the upward trend of the Indian equity market.\n\n**That's not it, We've some Bad News too!**\n\n1. An increase in interest rates in the US as well as reduced availability of cheap materials from the US supply base may cause inflation in India.\n2. A rise in the dollar may weaken several emerging market currencies, the Indian rupee included.\n3. Trump\u2019s unpredictable policies might promote some level of instability in the market which may result in losses for Indian investors.\n4. Already carried out restrictions on the issuance of H-1B visas restricted the growth of Indian IT companies and more of such policies can be anticipated in the future.\n5. Trump\u2019s comments on trade border measures by India may lead to aggravation of the current trade war with threats of even harsher measures.\n\nFor more such insights feel free to visit -\u00a0[https://x.com/Sahi\\_HQ](https://x.com/Sahi_HQ)",
