This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5\n\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red, with\u00a0**Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the\u00a0**Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over \u20b910 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks,\u00a0**Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India**\u00a0were the top losers on Nifty, while\u00a0**Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel**\u00a0managed to gain.\n\n**Broader Developments:**\n\n**RBI\u2019s Liquidity Boost:**\n\nRBI has announced plans to\u00a0**double its government securities purchase**\u00a0to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.\n\nThis move aims to\u00a0**address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the\u00a0**RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate**\u00a0to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.\n\nThe market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.\n\n**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**\n\nThe survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:\n\n* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.\n* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.\n* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.\n* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.\n* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).\n* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.\n\nDespite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.\n\n**Expert Talks:**\n\n**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**\n\n# Focus on Asset Allocation\n\nNaren stressed that\u00a0**how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**\u2014it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should\u00a0**stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**\n\n# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks\n\nRight now, Naren is\u00a0**cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.**\u00a0He pointed out that:\n\n* Many of these stocks are\u00a0**expensive**\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of money flowing into them.\n* The\u00a0**quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**\n* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is\u00a0**most investors don\u2019t hold them long enough**\u00a0to benefit.\n\n# What\u2019s Attractive in the Market Right Now?\n\nNaren admitted that\u00a0**finding undervalued investments isn\u2019t easy right now.**\u00a0However, a few areas look interesting:\n\n* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**\u2014these haven\u2019t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.\n* **Large-cap stocks aren\u2019t in a bubble, but they aren\u2019t cheap either.**\n\n# Advice for Investors\n\nNaren had some straightforward advice:\n\n* **Understand the risks**\u00a0of what you\u2019re investing in before putting in your money.\n* **Avoid loss-making companies**\u00a0with high valuations\u2014especially if you\u2019re a new investor.\n* **Start with hybrid funds**\u00a0(a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.\n\n# What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nOn the global front, Naren admitted things are\u00a0**uncertain.**\u00a0He\u2019s especially watching the\u00a0**long dollar trade**\u2014if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The\u00a0**U.S. market is tricky right now**\u00a0with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests\u00a0**taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**\n\n# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?\n\nNaren thinks\u00a0**we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn\u2019t change India\u2019s long-term growth story\u2014**the country still has a bright future.**\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAt the end of the day, Naren\u2019s message was simple:\u00a0**focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**\n\n**Watch the complete interview here:** [**https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y**](https://youtu.be/SX6kZ0LYa-Y)\n\nRead the detailed blog here: [https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february](https://sabiduriacapital.substack.com/p/market-notes-11th-february)",

The stock has broken its support level and closed below it, signaling a bearish sentiment. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.\n\nAdditionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance. What is your opinion?",

I also like dividends.I am also hoping to get the ITC Hotel share(1 share for every 10 ITC Stocks)\n\n2)COALINDIA(4 shares) -> I was interested in a stock that paid steady dividends and want to hold this until I can recover my capital.I bought this before November 5(so will get the dividend that is going to paid out).This stock also had a somewhat okayish price for me and so I bought this.\n\n3)IDFCFIRSTB(4 shares in total -> 1 purchased 3 more today) : I am related to some people who works in banks (not in IDFCFIRSTB or CANARA )and they suggested this and CANARA BANK. I am also somewhat hopeful in their CEO . I plan to buy 1 share of this bank weekly till 2025 June or till the stock price increases to 100 Rs whichever is sooner.\n\n4)CANARA BANK(30 shares in total) : I was recommended this and the stock did pay good dividends.\n\n5) Soon to be included -> plan to buy 100 shares of Federal Bank when the price cools down as I think someday the price will go lower and I do not have much funds now.\n\nI also have a mutual fund where 500 rupees is deposited every month.\n\n# I intend to not be an active investor and am interested in dividends.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjuvw3tpgazd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80477eb1b0ea28478a70b40efab6bef150312bb4\n\n",

The stock has broken its support level and closed below it, signaling a bearish sentiment. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.\n\nAdditionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance.",

Moreover, pledged quantity is more than what they hold. Interestingly, my zerodha account shows no such thing so it cannot be a glitch. None of us do intr day or future/options, only delivery based equity.\n\nI remember some 15 years back India infoline did something similar to this when they pledged shares without explicit information and made some trades and lost money from my father's account. We had to take them to SEBI for partial recovery. I am worried zerodha is on same path. I am attaching the screenshot below. Pls help me make sense out of this. Have raised a ticket but there is trust deficit there given the past.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6royu8a3qnkd1.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=67be90cdbabe2a269469509627a53f6d6f08aead\n\n\n\n",

Even tried with some Premium services like ET Money Genius but still failed. Then decided to stop trading and keep only investing. I started to invest in some good stocks like Coal India, ITC, HCLTECH and some ETF. Today I feel like I took good decision and the portfolio is stable. Even generating small dividends also. So at the end everyone has their style to play with it you need to identify where do u fit. ",
