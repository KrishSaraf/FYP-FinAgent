The stock has been in a downtrend since September 2024, correcting more than 35% from its all-time high. After a sharp decline, it now appears to be entering a pullback phase. On the daily timeframe, the stock is forming an RSI divergence, supported by a buy signal from the Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI). The RMI is already in buy mode on the daily chart and has generated a fresh buy signal on the weekly timeframe. The stock is currently trading above the 20-day SMA of the Bollinger Bands, and if it closes above the 40-day EMA, supported by RSI divergence and RMI, it could indicate a short-term upward move in the form of a pullback.",2025-01-30 08:22:59,8.0,12.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1idih3e/hero_motocorp_set_for_a_rebound/,IndianStockMarket

\*On daily chart\*

* This was the Last Lower High formed by the price in the downtrend before the price was supported at 4596.
* Now the price has dropped down to the same support zone looking to form a new Lower Low of the downtrend.
* RSI is nearing oversold zone, which signals a potential reversal.
* The price will test the support and form a new Lower Low and then bounce back.

Please suggest any corrections or thought on the analysis. It's my 10th day of doing these analysis. I definitely can use some comments, roasts and advices on my analysis.

comment,1hq5wcc,,,,,,,m4nqgmx,SuperbPercentage8050,"Well most of them are purchased at expensive valuations. 
A stock at 80-100 PE makes money only of growth rates are 40-50% YOY otherwise compress will erode your capital. 

Your portfolio construct has 2-3 fundamentals issues. 
Firstly you should not have so many stocks in a 13 lac portfolio. 
Max 10 top ideas 

Secondly you overpaid for growth.You cannot pay such high multiples for capital intensive business models and business thats are growing at 10-15% only. 

You haven’t checked the fundamentals and most of them are social media and popular theme stocks. 

But the most critical issue is that you ignored the valuations and invested in sectors that don’t compound in long run. 

TRENT is a 140 PE stock, it has already priced in several years of growth and priced to perfection. 
If anything goes wrong you will face massive drag because it has no margin of safety. Same is with JIO financials. 

With Cochin you paid a multiple of around 60 now thats compressing. Companies in these sector trade at 15-20 PE max so the compression will be detrimental.  

HAL is good , its just valuations but long term is good and major reason is that now MF are moving away from this sector because the momentum in defence stocks is over and Valuation correction is happening. 

PNB just get rid of it before it destory your capital. Its a PSU BANK with bad capital allocation and management. Dont get trapped by LOW PE in this stock, market is pricing PNB at such low multiple for a reason. It has already eroded 40-50% of capital of investor who invested a decade back. 


AU has good revenue and eps growth, you just paid a higher PE for sector which is going through a credit cycle, but long term hold will make you profits in this company. 

PCBL is a commodity business and lack pricing power so margin profile gets affected by global demand supply issues. They dont have stable FCF and MARGIN profile. Plus interest payment on debt is increasing which is affecting their net profit. 
You should switch from this. 

PNC INFRA has weak order book now because of being disqualified by GOVT, that’s why market is not giving it higher multiple plus it will be hard for then to gain future contracts and management issues are a big red flag. 
If you want to play infra switch to HG infra 


Hero and BAJAJ are good hold for long term they will compound at 10-15% and both are at attractive valuations. 


Airtel is at dangerous valuations of 76 but they are gaining market share and can justify it if their eps growth is good. But dont expect huge returns from
then because one engine of stock expansion is gone. (PE moved from 30-35 to 80). So now alll depends om their earning to justify the multiples as there is no futher room for expansion on PE . 
One more things investors in 2013 paid the same multiple and then the PE compressed to 20-30 range and stock went in plateau mode for next 4 years. So you should avoid this habit of overpaying",2024-12-31 07:04:17,20.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hq5wcc/experts_when_will_i_recover/,StockMarketIndia

post,1h09nn8,Rate my portfolio and give me some advice!,KaunBanegaCryptopati,"Hi, I'm a 21 year old guy just completed my degree and working with my father in his business. I have been investing into the stock market for 3-4 years now. Was doing part time work throughout college and managed to save 80% for investments. In 2 years I had 23% XIRR but my main issue was that my portfolio was so diversified that even ~ 200% gains in some stocks had no real meaning (eg - I averaged zomato at rs 75 per share but only bought 12k worth of it, sold it at ~rs 295) I exited the market at the best time, sold all my portfolio at the top (walked away with 95k profit) but I think I messed up my re-entry. I have 50% capital remaining, should I use that to increase my concentration in current stocks or buy other ones? Please give me some solid advice.

Let me tell you why I back ola, I looked at the global ev industry, and I kid you not not only in evs, India is below all the major countries in almost all industries. In China for example there are more than 1000 companies making batteries, you think this is it? Naah there are whole billion dollars industries revolving around battery components, like anode/cathod, battery chemicals, battery casing, the nanotechnology going inside these batteries. INDIA HAS EXACTLY 0 SUCH COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURS ALL THIS, LITERALLY 0. Now comes ola, saying they will create the whole battery in-house, I repeat the WHOLE BATTERY. Once this is actually done, see how much margin they can have on their products and selling the battery alone too. And let's say bam China imports are banned or the tarrif becomes to high, where will all the major battery importers shift to? India, boom we have OLA. 

I know there are companies like Amara raja and Excide, but if OLA is able to do this it will have double benefit, scooters will become cheaper plus if they started selling the battery or even battery components that's a whole new vertical that hasn't been factored into yet.",2024-11-26 17:06:56,1.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1h09nn8/rate_my_portfolio_and_give_me_some_advice/,StockMarketIndia

The stock was trading at 4,146 on January 30, 2025. As we discussed, it was positioned for a short-term pullback, and it has now started moving in our direction. Looking at the weekly timeframe, we can identify a strong resistance level around 4,770, where the 40-week EMA and the 20-week SMA of the Bollinger Bands coincide.",2025-02-02 07:33:42,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1ifs3ub/hero_motocorp_trade_update_approaching_key/,StockMarketIndia

The stock has been in a downtrend since September 2024, correcting more than 35% from its all-time high. After a sharp decline, it now appears to be entering a pullback phase. On the daily timeframe, the stock is forming an RSI divergence, supported by a buy signal from the Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI). The RMI is already in buy mode on the daily chart and has generated a fresh buy signal on the weekly timeframe. The stock is currently trading above the 20-day SMA of the Bollinger Bands, and if it closes above the 40-day EMA, supported by RSI divergence and RMI, it could indicate a short-term upward move in the form of a pullback.",2025-01-30 08:19:40,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1idifmi/hero_motocorp_poised_for_a_rebound/,StockMarketIndia

comment,1es1rb4,,,,,,,li2u2eu,3D_Noob_Guy,"Doesn't matter what everyone says - putt SL, have strong discipline towards risk:reward...etc etc...
Reality is risk management comes with psychology. Doesn't matter how much you think you'll follow a strong risk management, it won't matter if you don't have the mental capacity for it. When you'll be in loss you'll think ""Maybe now the price will go up. Maybe I should wait a little more. Maybe I should increase my SL..."" etc...
Learning risk management is one thing. Having the mental balls to implement it in your trade is a totally different thing. The reality is, in trading concepts are very easy to learn. You buy low and sell high. Nothing too complicated in that. But in reality that simple concept plays with your mind and you end up experience tons of things because of it like FOMO, greed, desperation and whatnot... Same goes for risk management. It is easy to understand- you don't risk more than a certain percentage of your capital. But when you're in a trade you start getting emotional and then shit goes south and along with it goes your risk management.
So, remember one thing - risk management, discipline... you'll learn none of that in their true sense unless you've spent time in the market. Time in the market prepares your psychology and only with psychology can you actually implement these things...",2024-08-14 14:26:58,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1es1rb4/how_to_learn_risk_management/,StockMarketIndia

I’ve been doing this for a decade. Separately, of course, I have a personal equity portfolio as well — in that, I have been investing ~40% of my capital based on momentum factor for the past couple of years and that has beat the broader market indices by a decent margin. 

Beginning today, in this thread, I’ll post top 10 stocks from Nifty50 which are currently experiencing high momentum. I’ll update this list on a weekly basis. 

If I see interest in these lists, I’ll post high momentum stocks from small- and mid-caps as well. I have a couple of smallcases as well (freely available) that are also based on momentum tracking. These have given 79% and 20% returns in the past 14 months and 4 months, respectively.

On the daily timeframe, the stock is forming an RSI divergence, supported by a buy signal from the Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI). The RMI is already in buy mode on the daily chart and has generated a fresh buy signal on the weekly timeframe. The stock is currently trading above the 20-day SMA of the Bollinger Bands, and if it closes above the 40-day EMA, supported by RSI divergence and RMI, it could indicate a short-term upward move in the form of a pullback.",2025-01-30 08:23:45,3.0,8.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1idihfh/hero_motocorp_set_for_a_rebound/,IndianStreetBets
