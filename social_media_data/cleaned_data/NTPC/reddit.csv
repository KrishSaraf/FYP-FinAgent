post,1gsiqni,NTPC Green Energy IPO analysis and verdict,Lazy-Transition8236,"**1. Company fundamentals**

NTPC Green Energy Limited is owned by NTPC Limited. It is India's largest power generation company. The company has a lot of positives such as:

**Strong Parentage:** Company is backed by NTPC Limited, a state-owned enterprise, which provides NTPC Green with financial stability and access to resources.

**Company Growth:** NTPC Green Energy has seen a revenue growth rate of 46.82%, increasing from ₹910.42 crore in FY 2022 to ₹1,962.60 crore in FY 2024. The profit after tax has been growing at a CAGR of 90.75%, increasing from ₹94.74 crore in FY 2022 to ₹344.72 crore in FY 2024.

**Government Support:** The Indian government's emphasis on renewable energy and policies such as 24x7 power for all, Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, PLI schemes and multiple green energy schemes can benefit NTPC Green.

2. **Issue size and split**

The size of the IPO is Rs. 10000 crore and the minimum investment is Rs. 14,904 for retail investors.

The NTPC Green Energy IPO is a **purely fresh issue**, meaning there is **no Offer For Sale (OFS)** component. This is a huge green flag since we know that all proceeds from the IPO will go directly to the company and will not be cashed out by existing promoters.

3. **Brand name and experienced Management**

As mentioned earlier, the company is a subsidiary of state-owned NTPC Ltd. The key management team is experienced and has good expertise in the power sector.

The management is led by CEO Mr. Rajiv Gupta, CFO Mr. Neeraj Sharma and company secretary Mr. Manish Kumar.

4. **Valuation**

NTPC Green is aiming for a valuation of around $12 billion, which is one of the biggest valuations in the renewable energy sector.

The company's PE ratio of 148 is higher than its smaller peers but is lesser than its bigger rival Adani Green Energy's PE ratio of 260. The valuation is considered reasonable, given the company's strong fundamentals, growth prospects, and the government's push for renewable energy.

5. **Clear Use of Proceeds**

The company proposes to use the proceeds from the IPO towards investment in the wholly-owned subsidiary, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (NREL), for repay debts of subsidiary NTPC Renewable Energy and the remaining for general corporate purposes.

While this may raise questions among investors, repayment of debts also comes with positives such as reduced loans, reduce in interest outflow for company and increase in profits after tax (PAT).

6. **Strong underwriting team**

Reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the IPO signal credibility and thorough due diligence.

The book-running lead managers or underwriters to the issue are IDBI Capital Market Services Limited, HDFC Bank Limited, IIFL Securities Ltd and Nuvama Wealth Management Limited. The issue's registrar is Kfin Technologies Limited.

7. **QIB subscription**

When the big players are subscribing in the beginning, without coming the last moment for filling the QIB quota, we can believing that QIBs are genuinely interested in the IPO and company. So observe the QIB subscription numbers throughout all 3 days of the IPO.

**Verdict**

This IPO is mostly positive, you can invest money according to your risk appetite.",2024-11-16 08:08:34,124.0,46.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gsiqni/ntpc_green_energy_ipo_analysis_and_verdict/,IndianStockMarket

post,1guob63,How's your view on NTPC IPO?,OddUse8944,"NTPC Green IPO is opening today, market sentiment being neutral on it as Renewable energy is a challenging space in India. What are your views on its fundamentals? I for sure am aiming for long-term as I've been wanting to enter energy space for my portfolio. ",2024-11-19 03:52:53,31.0,43.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1guob63/hows_your_view_on_ntpc_ipo/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1guob63,,,,,,,lxw7kqa,Rajat_ETmoney,"Hey,

NTPC Green Energy is launching a ₹10,000 crore IPO, the third-largest of the year after Hyundai and Swiggy.

Before getting into the pros and cons of this IPO, let me give you a basic overview of this company. 

NTPC Green Energy is India's fourth-largest solar energy player, following Adani Green, ReNew Power, and Tata Power. It is a subsidiary of NTPC and was established in April 2022 to consolidate NTPC’s renewable energy assets. It focuses on solar and wind energy and works on large-scale projects for PSUs and Indian corporations.

By September 2024, they had an operational capacity of 3,300 MW across six states, secured contracts for 13,600 MW, and a project pipeline of 9,175 MW. That’s over 26,000 MW of capacity in total.

Now let’s move into fundamentals

https://preview.redd.it/sp274n959t1e1.jpeg?width=654&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e4d042f9a77b0d9fea90209a27c17f006685fc4

 

NTPC Green Energy, established in April 2022, has a short operating history.  

The company’s revenue grew significantly from ₹171 crore in FY23 to ₹2,038 crore in FY24, a massive 1,094% increase. 

Profits also rose from ₹171 crore to ₹345 crore, showing 101% growth year-on-year.  

Cash flow from operations surged from ₹17 crore to ₹1,600 crore, reflecting strong growth. 

The company boasts a high EBITDA margin of 89%, primarily because depreciation and interest are excluded from its calculation.  

However, its return on equity remains low at 5.5%, and the net debt-to-equity ratio is high at 2x as of March 2024.  

Now, if I talk about its valuations, They are aiming for a valuation of around $12 billion, making it one of the biggest in the renewable energy sector. 

Its price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is 260, higher than Adani Green Energy’s 173, and its price-to-book (PB) ratio is 10, slightly above the industry average. 

However, this valuation seems reasonable considering the company’s strong fundamentals, growth potential, and the government’s focus on promoting renewable energy.

How the company will use its proceeds?

The entire ₹10,000 crore IPO is a fresh issue, so the funds will directly benefit the company. However, ₹7,500 crore (75%) is earmarked to repay the debt of its subsidiary, NREL, which raises concerns about the company’s dependency on borrowed funds.

Here are some of the pros and cons of NTPC green energy: 

**Pros**

**Strong Parent Company:** NTPC Green Energy is backed by NTPC, a leader in India’s power sector, benefiting from its expertise and experience.  

**Growing Industry:** Renewable energy is a fast-growing and essential sector for the future. 

**Rapid Expansion:** The company has over 3,300 MW operational capacity and a strong pipeline of around 22,800 MW, providing good growth potential.  

**Fresh IPO:** The IPO is a fresh issue, meaning the funds raised will directly benefit the company and its shareholders.  

**Clean Track Record:** The company has no major legal or liability issues.  

**Cons**

**Limited History:** NTPC Green Energy is relatively new, with just 2.5 years of operating history.  

**High Debt and Low Returns:** The company has significant debt and low return ratios, paired with high valuations. 

 **Debt Dependency:** Most of the IPO funds will be used to reduce debt, but high capital expenditure needs may keep debt levels high.  

**Revenue and Asset Concentration:** Dependence on a few key suppliers, assets, and revenue sources poses risks.  

So, while the company is in a high-growth sector with solid backing, the heavy debt and steep valuations make it worth considering carefully.",2024-11-19 07:35:05,34.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1guob63/hows_your_view_on_ntpc_ipo/,IndianStockMarket

post,1h1auky,NTPC Green Energy’s Stock Market Strong Debut,abhijeetkumar21,"Big news in India’s renewable energy sector! NTPC Green Energy, a part of NTPC Limited, just had an incredible first day on the stock market. Its shares shot up by 14%, and now the company is valued at a whopping $12 billion.

Why is this a big deal? Because it shows that investors are super confident about the future of clean energy in India. The company’s IPO (when shares are sold to the public for the first time) was a massive hit, getting bids worth ₹154 billion (about $1.83 billion)—more than double what was expected!

And it’s not just hype. NTPC Green Energy’s numbers are strong:

Last year, their profits almost doubled to ₹3.45 billion.

Revenue grew by 35% to ₹19.63 billion.

India is also playing big in the renewable energy game, with plans to invest $385 billion by 2030. NTPC Green Energy’s success is a clear sign that this sector is full of potential and opportunities.

After a prolonged bull run, NTPC is now exhibiting signs of weakness and potential reversal. The stock has broken its support level and closed below it, signaling a bearish sentiment. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.

Additionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance.

post,1igj3pu,"STOCK MARKET CRASH AFTER BUDGET 2025 IS THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO RETAIL INVESTORS – CRY MORE, PAPER HANDS!""",masterbaras,"Let the tears flow from the ""experts"" and institutional clowns 🤡 who are panic-selling today. While Sensex tanked \~750 points and Nifty kissed 23,226. The REAL INVESTORS are rubbing their hands like Thanos snapping half the universe. Here’s why these ""crashes"" are a BLESSING:

1.FOREIGNERS DUMPING SHARES? THANK THEM FOR THE DISCOUNT!

FIIs sold ₹1,327 CRORE worth of stocks post-Budget. Good riddance! These guys have been net sellers since October 2024, and now they’re handing us CHEAP BLUE-CHIPS on a silver platter. Tata Steel, L&T, NTPC – all down 3-4%? I’ll take your entire stock!

2. TRUMP’S TARIFF TANTRUM = BLACK FRIDAY SALE

25% tariffs on Mexico/Canada and 10% on China? Global markets panicking? WHO CARES. This isn’t 2018. The Modi govt’s tax cuts (₹12.75L income = ZERO TAX) will unleash a CONSUMPTION BOOM for FMCG, autos, and durables. Maruti, ITC, Dabur at discounts? Load. The. Boat.

3. MID/SMALLCAP BLOODBATH? PERFECT TIME TO BUY FUTURE MULTIBAGGERS

BSE Midcap/Smallcap down 1-8%? Bharat Dynamics, JP Power, IREDA getting slaughtered? Yes, please! Retail investors with DIAMOND HANDS know corrections are where fortunes are made. Remember 2020? Exactly.

4. ""BUT WHAT ABOUT RBI POLICY UNCERTAINTY!"" – STFU AND BUY

The rupee’s at 87/USD, and RBI might cut rates? EVEN BETTER. Cheaper loans = more spending = auto, real estate, and consumer stocks 📈. Weak hands are selling because they can’t handle volatility. We feast on their fear.

5. GOVT’S ""LACK OF CAPEX"" IS A SMOKESCREEN

Sure, railway/defense/infra stocks dipped, but the Budget’s ₹500Cr AI fund and MSME credit boost are LONG-TERM WINNERS. Paperhands crying about ""no capex"" don’t understand strategic plays.

CONCLUSION: This ""crash"" is a FIRE SALE for those with vision. The FII exodus and Trump’s meltdown are clearing the path for retail investors to DOMINATE. Stay greedy, buy the dip, and let the panic-sellers fund your retirement.

post,1fy9fhd,"I asked ChatGPT to act as a financial advisor and list me the stocks of the company whose products/services will always be in demand irrespective of war, lower income, and GDP fall, this is what it analyzed. Fascinating conversation ahead!!!  The most funny part is in the end.",dare-to-live,"**ChatGPT:**

There are certain goods and services that people will always need, regardless of economic conditions, crises, or even wars. These essentials are typically linked to survival, basic needs, and essential services. Here’s a breakdown of the types of products and services people will always buy:

# 1. Food and Water

* **Staples**: Basic food items like rice, bread, grains, and canned goods are always in demand.
* **Water**: Clean drinking water or water purification products remain essential.

# 2. Healthcare and Medicine

* **Prescription Drugs**: People with chronic conditions or illnesses require medications regardless of circumstances.
* **Over-the-Counter Medicine**: Pain relievers, cold and flu medicine, and first-aid supplies will always be needed.
* **Medical Services**: Hospitals, clinics, and emergency medical services remain essential.

# 3. Hygiene Products

* **Toiletries**: Soap, shampoo, toothpaste, and sanitary products are necessary for basic hygiene.
* **Cleaning Supplies**: Disinfectants, laundry detergent, and household cleaners are always in demand for maintaining sanitation.

# 4. Shelter and Utilities

* **Housing**: Whether through rent or ownership, people will always need shelter.
* **Utilities**: Water, electricity, and gas are essential to operate homes and keep them livable.

# 5. Basic Clothing

* People need clothing, especially functional items like winter jackets, shoes, and workwear.

# 6. Communication and Connectivity

* **Internet and Phone Services**: In the modern world, communication is vital for both personal and business survival. Even in crises, people need to stay connected.
* **Basic Electronics**: Devices like phones and computers will remain essential for communication, work, and accessing information.

# 7. Transportation

* **Fuel**: Gasoline, diesel, or alternatives like electricity for vehicles.
* **Basic Vehicle Maintenance**: In areas where public transport is scarce or unavailable, people will maintain their cars.

# 8. Security

* **Home Security**: Systems that provide safety and security will always have demand.
* **Personal Safety**: In some areas or during times of conflict, items like protective gear, firearms, or security services may become essential.

# 9. Education

* **Basic Learning Tools**: Even in tough times, education is a priority for many, leading to the ongoing purchase of school supplies, textbooks, and online learning resources.

# 10. Debt Servicing

* People are generally required to continue making payments on debts like mortgages, loans, and credit cards even during economic downturns or crises.

These goods and services represent core needs, making them ""recession-proof"" or ""war-proof"" industries in most circumstances.

**Me: Okay, based on this. What are the Indian stocks that a person should buy?**

**ChatGPT:**

* **Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUL)** - FMCG (consumer products).
* **Nestlé India** - Food and beverages (ethical and compliant products).
* **Tata Consumer Products** - Food and beverage sector.
* **Cipla** - Pharmaceutical company.
* **Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories** - Pharmaceutical company.
* **Sun Pharmaceuticals** - Pharmaceutical company.
* **Apollo Hospitals** - Healthcare provider.
* **NTPC Ltd.** - Power generation (utilities).
* **Tata Power** - Renewable and conventional energy provider.
* **GAIL India Ltd.** - Natural gas processing and distribution.
* **Godrej Consumer Products** - FMCG (consumer and personal care products).

**Me:** Okay, if I had 1,00,000 rs of capital and my goal is for 5 years, which stock should I invest in and in what ratio? Do your analysis as a financial advisor and tell me the answer

**ChatGPT:**

* **Cipla**: ₹20,000 (20%)
* **Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories**: ₹10,000 (10%)
* **Sun Pharmaceuticals**: ₹10,000 (10%)
* **NTPC**: ₹15,000 (15%)
* **Tata Power**: ₹15,000 (15%)
* **Hindustan Unilever**: ₹15,000 (15%)
* **Tata Consumer Products**: ₹10,000 (10%)
* **Nestlé India**: ₹5,000 (5%)

**Me:** Okay, suppose I invest a 1,00,000 lump sum today, and for 5 years I invest 10,000 rs monthly for every month, then what will be my investment, and what will be my portfolio value after 5 years?

**ChatGPT:**

If you invest ₹1,00,000 as a lump sum today and continue investing ₹10,000 monthly for the next 5 years, here's the projection:

* **Total Investment**: ₹7,00,000 (₹1,00,000 lump sum + ₹10,000/month for 60 months).
* **Projected Portfolio Value after 5 Years**: **₹62,40,775**.

# Breakdown of Portfolio Value after 5 Years:

* **Cipla**: ₹8,46,283
* **Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories**: ₹7,87,823
* **Sun Pharmaceuticals**: ₹8,08,006
* **NTPC**: ₹7,37,022
* **Tata Power**: ₹7,56,180
* **Hindustan Unilever**: ₹7,95,875
* **Tata Consumer Products**: ₹7,68,101
* **Nestlé India**: ₹7,41,486

This growth assumes steady market conditions and the projected annual growth rates for each stock.

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Me:** WHAT PERCENTAGE GROWTH?

**ChatGPT:**

The projected percentage growth of your portfolio over 5 years is approximately **791.54%** based on the lump sum and monthly investment strategy. This reflects the overall growth from your initial investment of ₹7,00,000 to the projected portfolio value of ₹62,40,775. **​**

I had invested 5000 in a large cap fund in 2006.. the current value is 43K.. it has given a CAGR of 12.6%.. That is what you should expect (12-15%) from the equities over a long period of time.. Anything more, you are being greedy and you stand a good chance of losing your investment.

post,1idiras,BUDGET:2025,Toad__Sage__,"Here are my few cents on what I think of the budget this time.

This will be one of the most imp if not the most imp budgets in quite a few yrs. Now that Modi govt. has settled there’s finally room to focus on **long-term economic development** rather than **short-term election-driven policies.**

Now govt. seriously have 2 choices--> **REDUCE TAXES TO PLEASE MIDDLE CLASS OR PRIORTIZE CAPEX.**

**WHAT WILL MAKE MARKET RISE?**

1. **AGGRESSIVE CAPEX spending**
2. **AI AND GREEN ENERGY incentives, along with expansion in PLI will help companies of auto, semiconductor and electronics sectors.**
3. **INFRA BOOST** – **More spending on roads, railways, and power benefits L&T, NTPC, Tata Power, cement & steel stocks.**
4. **JUST NO CHANGES IN LTCG, STCG AND STT surely will be a plus for the market.**
5. **A DECREASE IN PERSONAL TAXES will surely be loved by retail investors and as it will help in increasing the spending power of ppl, FMCG shares may see a rise.**

**WHAT WILL MAKE MARKET STUMBLE?**

1. **Hike CAPITAL GAINS or STT** – **Even a slight increase could be enough to drag the Nifty down by 1,000 points or more.**
2. **Lack of Disinvestment Push- I've been listening to this since covid, especially for PSU Banks, like seriously they still have not come up with which banks to privatise. Though anything said abt this will make shares rise, nothing said may lead to PSU shares stumbling.**
3. **High FISCAL DEFICIT & Borrowing** – **If capex spending is not backed by revenue growth, inflation concerns could spook the bond market and banks.**
4. **Surprise GST Hikes on Key Sectors** – **Any increase in GST on luxury goods, autos, or FMCG could hit consumption stocks. And as we see in almost every budget how this affects ITC.**

**The market is in a real imp position, and this budget could make or break the next bull run. If the government focuses on growth, investment, and market-friendly policies, we could finally see Indian markets catching up to global trends. But even one wrong policy move (especially on capital gains tax) could send the markets crashing.**

comment,1gc6kbr,,,,,,,ltskrt9,thumbliner,"Take a step back. There are three variables.

Investment = Dividend / Yield. 

If you know any two, you can find out the third. We know Dividend is 20,000 a month. That is what you want. In other words, 2,40,000 a year. 

Annual Dividend = 2,40,000

Let's think of a company that pays a stable dividend that they will be able to pay month after month, for many years, without much trouble. Some people see ITC as a candidate. It pays a quarterly dividend of Rs. 3.44 every quarter. That is Rs. 13.76 a year per share. 

The amount is not guaranteed but the management tries its best to maintain it. If the company has a good record over 30 years, it's likely to maintain it. 

So if we collect Rs. 13.76 per share, what is the dividend yield?

That depends on the price at which you bought the share. Right now, the price is 482. If I bought it at this price, and ITC pays 13.76 to me every year, the yield is 13.76 / 482 = 2.85%

Let's say we like it. So yield = 2.85%

---

Now we can calculate the investment needed for your purpose. 

Investment = 2,40,000 / 2.85%
= 84.21 Lakh

That is how much money you will have to invest.

---

It might seem very expensive, and in my opinion, it is. There are a couple of ways of solving this. 

1. Find something other than ITC that pays a better yield. The problem is that there aren't too many things out there that can actually pay such a high yield for a long time without going bankrupt. Usually, people who promise such returns disappoint their investors eventually. 

2. Lower your expectations. If all you have is 10 lakh to invest, and you aren't willing to gamble your savings away, accept the smaller dividend payment. In the case of ITC, it would be 10 lakh x 2.85% = 28,500 a year. That is 2,375 a month. 

3. Don't buy ITC at 482. Buy it when it is cheaper. In 2020, it was trading at 170. The person who buys it at 170 gets paid the same dividend of 13.76 as the person who paid 482. But their yields are different because their purchase price is different. For the person who bought the stock at 170, the yield of 13.76 / 170 = 8%

How much investment would it take to get a dividend of 2,40,000 a year if the yield was 8%?

2,40,000 / 8% = 30 lakhs

That is much better than 84.21.

The point is, the answer to your question depends on how much yield you can get from a safe asset? And companies don't make promises of a specific yield, but they try to protect the rupee amount. If you can buy the stock cheap enough, you can adjust the yield in your favor.

In India net rental yield on residential housing is around 2.5%.

It is the same for dividend yield.

You can either buy a 1 CR house and rent it out, or make a 1 CR portfolio of dividend stocks. 

Both cases you will make roughly 20K per month.

Dividends are tax inefficient. It is better to keep the money in the stock and let it grow.

Customer Support: If you can't find it online, contact your broker's customer support. They will ask for your PAN, registered mobile number, and other verification details to provide you with your Demat account number.



2. Through the Depositories (NSDL or CDSL):

In India, there are two main depositories: National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL).

Consolidated Account Statement (CAS):

Both NSDL and CDSL send a Consolidated Account Statement (CAS) periodically (monthly if there are transactions, half-yearly otherwise) to your registered email address. This statement summarizes all your holdings and transactions across all Demat accounts linked to your PAN, as well as mutual fund units.",2025-05-31 05:57:03,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1kzncyk/need_help/,IndianStockMarket

post,1g4uwd2,Indian PSU Stocks – % Fall from Highs and Potential for Recovery,altinvestindia,"Saw this table showing the performance of some well-known Indian PSU (Public Sector Undertaking) and related stocks, specifically highlighting how far they’ve fallen from their 52-week highs and how much they would need to rise to retest those highs.

Some Highlights :

* **Cochin Shipyard (COCHINSHIP)**: Down 43% from its high of ₹2912, it would need a 75% gain to retest that high.
* **MRPL**: Has seen a 40% decline and would need a 68% recovery to hit its previous high.
* **GRSE, HUDCO, ITI**: All showing falls of over 30%, with significant room for potential recovery (50-70%).

On the lower end:

* **NTPC, GAIL, BPCL**: These stocks are only down 4-6% and need relatively smaller recoveries (6-8%) to retest their highs

How many of you are stuck in these stocks and invested due to the hype and hoopla during the first half of the year.

Nifty is taking a beating, and red is the dominant color on my portfolio screen today. But remember saying: **""Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.""** This could be a opportunity to pick up some quality stocks at cheap prices. Strong companies that are getting dragged down by the overall market sentiment

I missed the 2020 crash (was severely affected with COVID and being alive is the biggest multibagger)

Here are a few things I'm considering : Strong Fundamentals, Low P/E Ratio, Future Prospects

My list for today: (let me put the disclaimer: THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH):

* HDFC Bank - Solid fundamentals, consistent growth, currently trading at a lower P/E
* Tata Motors - Digging it for turnaround story, EV play, currently undervalued
* Reliance industries - Mukesh bhai . The stock has corrected recently, is attractive to me

Since my portfolio is mostly in housing, energy, and auto, I’m looking to diversify into railways.

After researching, I’ve shortlisted RVNL, Titagarh Rail Systems, and Jupiter Wagons. All three have seen solid momentum recently, especially with the ₹7,927 crore government investment in railway infrastructure. Jupiter surged about 11.82% in a day, Titagarh is expanding into new sectors, and RVNL, as a PSU, could be a stable pick.

What do you guys think?

1. Which stock has the best long-term growth potential?

comment,1jhweim,,,,,,,mjaq21p,undervaluedequity,I'm currently invested in jupiter wagons and titagarh wagons. These companies need metals in cheap prices so when steel prices increase it makes a dent in their profits. Also they need to take debt as working capital sometimes interest on which is kind of high in other countries. So this is also a profit dent. These factors were volatile after trump administration came into power so these stocks got halved from their ATH. I think you won't regret buying these companies if you think these factors may get sorted in near future as if it touched their all time high again in next few months your investment would be doubled.

comment,1hawp77,,,,,,,m1bxphh,SuperbPercentage8050,"I have given a framework and checklist on r/indiagrowthstocks and be it mid cap or small cap or large cap if any stocks goes through that filter you will end up with high quality stocks and investment. 

The LARGE CAP WONT GO A 100 BAGGER BECAUSE OF SIZE AT A MATURE OR LATE STAGE YOU GET A DECENT 12-15% IF YOU HOLD IT FOR LONG TIME AND THE SECTOR ITSELF HAS A RUNWAY. 

With small and madcap if they operate in sectors that have growth for long periods and they dominate in that sector then you get multi baggers. because the pe expands from 215-20 to 80 and eps grows at same pace. 

for example polycab was a 8-10x because of the secular runway of fiberisation of whole India and pe was 20 so a reasonable valuation. pe expanded a3 times and eps also expanded 3-4 times  so we had a 10x return. 

  
asian paints use to trade at 20-25 pe and same goes for polycab and havells and so may other stocks before then run up. now trading in 2023 at 80-90 pe and growing at 10-15% is not justified that's why they are underperforming because pe will revert back to mean. same happened with Bajaj it was a 80 pe stock and eps went 2.5 times but pe compressed to 27 that's why stock didn't move. 



Growth and long runway is essential for a stock to compound and one needs to invest it at reasonable valuations, today most of mid and small are trading at 70-80 pe so even with all the growth the valuations and price we pay for that growth is not justified.",2024-12-10 08:19:34,9.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hawp77/buy_and_forget_strategy_for_bluechip_stocks/,IndianStockMarket

post,1j2k749,Newbie seeking guidance from Gurus here.,PoisonousShots,"Hi everyone,

I am new to the market so please don't criticize me I'm just looking for some validations. I've done some research in past few days with all this heightened excitement of marking falling and stocks coming up at discount.

I have some money which I've saved since last 3 years, roughly 10 lakhs which I'm looking to invest in this falling market. I know many might say I'm catching a falling knife but lemme be clear I'm not going to invest tomorrow I'll wait for the market to stabilize at least for a week because I'm okay to buy something at a discount of 20% than 30% I'm okay to have less profit and be at peace than rushing for high yields and getting mentally stressed daily.

So below is my analysis please let me know your thoughts too.

🚀 Portfolio Allocation (100%)

1️⃣ ICICI Bank – 20%
✅ Best private bank, strong profit growth, steady compounding.

2️⃣ Tata Motors – 15%
✅ EV market leader, JLR turnaround, auto sector boom.

3️⃣ HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics) – 15%
✅ Defense sector monopoly, strong government contracts, high order book.

4️⃣ NTPC – 10%
✅ India’s largest power producer, shift to renewables, stable dividends.

5️⃣ CDSL – 10%
✅ Monopoly in stock market infrastructure, rising Demat accounts, high profit margins.

6️⃣ IRCTC – 10%
✅ Railway ticketing & tourism monopoly, high-profit business, no competition.

7️⃣ REC Limited – 10%
✅ Power sector financing, stable cash flows, high dividend yield (~7%).

8️⃣ Samvardhana Motherson – 7%
✅ Leading auto component supplier, global expansion, exposure to EV parts.

9️⃣ Garden Reach Shipbuilders (GRSE) – 3%
✅ Niche defense shipbuilding, strategic contracts with Indian Navy & Coast Guard.


📌 Why This Allocation?

✔ Balanced mix of stability (ICICI, NTPC, REC) & high growth (Tata Motors, CDSL, HAL).
✔ Garden Reach (GRSE) strengthens defense exposure along with HAL.
✔ Portfolio covers multiple sectors – Banking, Defense, EV, Power, Infra, and Railways.


Please let me know your thoughts on this and be my guiding star, probably I'll learn something new from each one of you. 🥹",2025-03-03 14:44:15,5.0,15.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1j2k749/newbie_seeking_guidance_from_gurus_here/,IndianStockMarket

Make it focused of 5-10 stocks with 2 or 3 stocks as your biggest bets (ideally 50% of total capital in them).

I like the mix of stability with blue-chip names like ICICI Bank, NTPC, and REC, balanced with growth plays such as Tata Motors and HAL. Diversifying across sectors like banking, defense, EV, and infrastructure is smart. One suggestion would be to keep an eye on market trends as you wait for the market to stabilize, since timing the entry can be tricky, and always be ready to adjust if the fundamentals change.

comment,1j1rnkw,,,,,,,mfmxduh,SubstantialRest7116,"### Portfolio Overview
You’ve invested in 14 assets: 12 individual stocks, 1 sectoral ETF (Nifty SBI ETF), and 1 gold ETF (Gold Bees). Total allocation sums to 100%, so I assume this is your full portfolio. Here’s the breakdown by sector/type based on your holdings:

- **Energy/PSUs**: NTPC (6.64%), NTPC Green (9.28%), ONGC (6.97%), IOC (4.81%), IRFC (5.56%) – **33.26%**
- **Finance**: SBI (7.66%), Manappuram (6.13%), Bajaj Housing Finance (2.55%) – **16.34%**
- **Pharma**: Dr. Reddy’s (5.82%), Natco Pharma (6.96%) – **12.78%**
- **Auto**: Tata Motors (9.41%) – **9.41%**
- **IT**: Wipro (7.23%) – **7.23%**
- **FMCG**: ITC (4.87%) – **4.87%**
- **ETFs**: Nifty SBI ETF (6.02%), Gold Bees (9.96%) – **15.98%**

**Key Observations**:
- Heavy PSU exposure (33.26%), especially energy-related (NTPC, ONGC, IOC, IRFC).
- Diversified across sectors, but concentrated in a few stocks (e.g., NTPC Green, Tata Motors, Gold Bees each ~9-10%).
- Current ETF allocation (Nifty SBI + Gold Bees) is ~16%, with intent to increase it.

### Performance Context: Down 20% Since July 2024
You started investing in July 2024, and as of March 2, 2025 (8 months later), you’re down 20%. Let’s contextualize this:
- **Market Trends (July 2024–March 2025)**: The Nifty 50, a broad market benchmark, grew ~5-7% in this period (based on historical trends and assuming no major crash by March 2025). However, midcaps, smallcaps, and PSUs (where you’re heavily invested) saw volatility—some PSU stocks corrected 15-25% after a 2023-early 2024 rally.
- **Your Portfolio**: A 20% loss suggests your picks underperformed the broader market, likely due to sector-specific declines or stock selection.

**Is This Normal?**: For a beginner starting mid-2024:
- Yes, it’s possible. Markets don’t always go up, and 2024 saw profit booking in PSU and midcap stocks after a multi-year bull run.
- No, it’s not ideal. A 20% drop against a flat-to-up broader market indicates some stock-specific or allocation issues.

**Red Flags**:
- **Wipro**: IT sector faced headwinds in 2024 (US slowdown, fewer contracts). Fundamentally weaker than peers.
- **PSU Overweight (IRFC, NTPC, ONGC, IOC)**: 2024 saw PSU profit-taking after a 2023 boom—your timing might’ve coincided with this.
- No glaring “wrong” stocks, but high exposure to volatile PSUs and midcaps likely amplified your loss.


- **Current Volatility**: 
  - PSU-heavy (33%) and midcaps (e.g., Manappuram, Natco) are volatile—20% drop reflects this.
  - Gold Bees (10%) and Nifty SBI ETF (6%) are stabilizers, but 16% isn’t enough to offset stock-specific risk.
- **Plan to Increase Nifty ETF & Gold**:
  - **Nifty ETF**: Tracks Nifty 50, low volatility (~15-20% annualized), diversified across sectors. Increasing this (e.g., to 15-20%) balances your PSU tilt.
  - **Gold**: Low correlation to stocks, hedges inflation. Boosting to 15% (from 10%) makes sense—gold’s uptrend in 2024 supports this.
- **Suggestion**: Trim high-risk stocks (e.g., NTPC Green, Tata Motors—your 9%+ bets) to fund ETFs. Aim for 20% Nifty ETF + 15% Gold (35% low-volatility assets).

### My View on Your Portfolio
- **Strengths**: Decent diversification (energy, finance, pharma, etc.), some defensive picks (ITC, Gold), PSU exposure taps government growth themes.
- **Weaknesses**: 
  - Overweight PSUs (33%) at a volatile time—your 20% loss likely stems from this correction.
  - High single-stock bets (9-10% in Tata Motors, NTPC Green) amplify risk for a beginner.
  - Wipro’s underperformance is a weak link.
- **Is Something Wrong?**: Not fundamentally—your stocks aren’t “bad” picks. The issue is timing (bought at peaks?) and allocation (too much in volatile segments).
- **Normalcy**: A 20% drop in 8 months isn’t rare for a stock-heavy portfolio in a corrective phase, but it’s steeper than the market—adjustments can help.


### Recommendations
1. **Rebalance**:
   - Reduce NTPC Green, Tata Motors to 5-6% each.
   - Exit or trim Wipro (swap for a stronger IT stock like Infosys if you want IT).
   - Boost Nifty ETF to 15-20% and Gold Bees to 15%.
2. **Hold Steady**: ITC, Dr. Reddy’s, SBI, ONGC are solid—don’t panic-sell losses.
3. **Learn Timing**: Use SIPs for ETFs to avoid buying at peaks.
4. **Review**: Check your cost price vs. March 2025 levels—share specifics if you want deeper analysis.",2025-03-02 17:32:07,9.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1j1rnkw/would_love_to_hear_your_views_on_my_portfolio/,IndianStockMarket

Suzlon moving 42% in last 3 months, while swinging wildly in last 1 year in sync with larger market sentiments.

NTPC is down ~10% since it's IPO, but has recovered significantly in last 3 months. About 27% gain on last 90 days.

IREDA is static over the last year or so. 

Wondering if I were to consolidate my investments to one of these scrips. Which one should I go for. Heart says Suzlon, but mind suggests to stick with one of the two sarkari entities.

post,1end0rm,Did i mess up buying during the dip?,ParticularClerk432,"M 24.

Hey guys, so i got some extra money to invest in the market and seeing the small dip thought it's a good time to buy some stocks. Need your opinion on wether i made the correct choice or not? (Edited this line)

Here's the list of stocks that i put a buying order for -

* coal india - 20 shares, each for - 525
* SBI - 10 shares, each for 810
* ONGC - 50 shares, each for 323
* NTPC - 40 shares, each for 407.55
* Tata steel - 20 shares, each for 151.12

I had some cash remaining in hand and saw some good dips on stocks that i had been looking at for a while and all of these had good fundamentals and were rated buy on indmoney and  [trendlyne](https://trendlyne.com/markets-today-loggedin/).

i am doubtful about my impromptu buying and i know that this can cause a lot of issues for me in the future if i don't learn the discipline to control myself.

post,1gup55u,View on current Market,iInventor_0134,"1. At the time of posting, Nifty and Sensex both are up by 1%. Banks are very much in green.
2. USDINR is at 84.4. 0.03% positive. 
3. Most PSUs from all caps in green. REC, IRFC, NTPC everyone.

My understanding -   
If a FII decides to invest in India today, due to the USD value for each dollar they invest, it will Rs.84. So, they will have more value in Rs. according to this.   
They have mroe liquid to dump in this cheaper market. Similarly, the DIIs can double down on their prices giving more good risk-reward ratio in fundamentally good companies.

This will excite the retail investors to invest again pushing the overall index up to a new target 27K. Good swing trade opporutnites here.  
Volume can be a good indicator for stocks where there is heavy buying. 

Some stocks are simply hitting UC from last 2-3 sessions. There is definite heavy buying for a good rally in coming months IG.

Make your own system. Some of the investment / trade rationale as follows: (these are hypothetical only)

1) invest in ntpc because it’s building capacity to generate 2X of power it generates now in next 3-4 years. It pays dividend and can give more than 2X returns in next 5 years. Buy shares when you have money.

2) ntpc corrected a lot, let me buy and sell when it’s 20% up. Use the money to spot next opportunity in same or other share.

3) ntpc is still lower than it’s 52 week high. A new 52 week high would be 10-20% higher. Buy and hold till it achieves that. 

All the above also have multiple what ifs that you will need to figure out.

   - **Cost**: ₹1,86,052  
   - **Sector**: FMCG (Beverages)  
   - **Thoughts**: VBL, the PepsiCo bottler, has been a strong performer historically due to its monopoly-like position in India’s bottling market and expansion into new geographies. Your entry price of ₹465.13 seems reasonable (assuming this is adjusted for splits; VBL underwent a 2:5 split in 2023, so pre-split prices were higher). The FMCG sector tends to be defensive, and VBL’s growth in snacks (e.g., Cheetos deal in Morocco) adds upside potential. Posts on X from February 2025 highlighted JP Morgan’s bullish stance on VBL, suggesting optimism from institutional investors. Keep an eye on volume growth and input cost pressures (e.g., sugar, PET resin).

2. **Clean Science and Technology Ltd**  
   - **100 shares @ ₹1,379**  
   - **Cost**: ₹1,37,900  
   - **Sector**: Specialty Chemicals  
   - **Thoughts**: Clean Science is a high-quality player in the specialty chemicals space, benefiting from the China+1 trend and strong margins. However, the chemical sector can be cyclical, and your entry at ₹1,379 might be on the higher side if the stock hasn’t rallied significantly since. Check its recent quarterly results—margin compression or export slowdowns could explain any underperformance.

3. **Jio Financial Services Ltd (Jiofin)**  
   - **500 shares @ ₹233** (Recent addition)  
   - **Cost**: ₹1,16,500  
   - **Sector**: Financial Services  
   - **Thoughts**: Jio Financial, a Reliance spin-off, is a bet on digital finance and lending growth. At ₹233, your entry aligns with its early trading range post-listing in 2023. It’s a high-potential but speculative pick, as its business model is still evolving. Inclusion in the NSE F&O segment in November 2024 (as per web data) could boost liquidity and volatility. Patience is key here—monitor its progress in lending and tech-driven offerings.

4. **Devyani International Ltd**  
   - **505 shares @ ₹157**  
   - **Cost**: ₹79,285  
   - **Sector**: QSR (Quick Service Restaurants)  
   - **Thoughts**: Devyani (KFC, Pizza Hut operator) is another consumer-facing stock with growth potential tied to India’s rising dining-out trend. Your ₹157 entry is decent, though recent block deals (e.g., Yum Restaurants selling a 4.4% stake at ₹153.5 in February 2024) might have pressured the price. JP Morgan’s overweight stance on consumer stocks like Devyani (X post) is encouraging. Watch same-store sales growth (SSSG) and expansion plans.

5. **HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd**  
   - **110 shares @ ₹667**  
   - **Cost**: ₹73,370  
   - **Sector**: Insurance  
   - **Thoughts**: HDFC Life is a solid long-term pick in the underpenetrated Indian insurance market. At ₹667, your entry is close to its historical trading range. Insurance stocks can be slow movers but offer stability. Check its VNB (Value of New Business) growth and persistency ratios in recent quarters—any dip could explain your portfolio’s loss.

6. **Laurus Labs Ltd**  
   - **150 shares @ ₹466**  
   - **Cost**: ₹69,900  
   - **Sector**: Pharmaceuticals  
   - **Thoughts**: Laurus Labs has exposure to APIs, generics, and CDMO (contract development and manufacturing). The pharma sector has been volatile due to US pricing pressures and raw material costs. Your ₹466 entry might be near its 2023-2024 range, but if it hasn’t broken out, it could be weighing on your returns. Look at its CDMO pipeline for future catalysts.

7. **Central Depository Services Ltd (CDSL)**  
   - **60 shares @ ₹1,208** (Recent addition)  
   - **Cost**: ₹72,480  
   - **Sector**: Depositories/Financial Infrastructure  
   - **Thoughts**: CDSL benefits from rising demat accounts and market participation in India. At ₹1,208 (likely pre-split; it had a 2:1 split in 2023), your adjusted entry might be lower. It’s a steady, low-risk pick with monopoly-like traits. Recent additions to your portfolio suggest confidence in its growth—check trading volumes and new account additions.

8. **KFin Technologies Ltd**  
   - **60 shares @ ₹852** (Recent addition)  
   - **Cost**: ₹51,120  
   - **Sector**: Financial Services (RTA)  
   - **Thoughts**: KFintech, a registrar and transfer agency, is a niche player riding the mutual fund and capital market boom. ₹852 is a bold entry, but JP Morgan’s top pick status (X post) aligns with its growth story. It’s a small but high-conviction position—monitor its client additions and profitability.

9. **Sona BLW Precision Forgings Ltd**  
   - **50 shares @ ₹714**  
   - **Cost**: ₹35,700  
   - **Sector**: Auto Components/EV  
   - **Thoughts**: Sona BLW is well-positioned for the EV transition with its driveline components. ₹714 is reasonable if bought before its recent EV-driven rally. Auto ancillary stocks can be volatile with OEM demand—check order wins and EV exposure.

10. **AAVAS Financiers Ltd**  
    - **20 shares @ ₹1,454**  
    - **Cost**: ₹29,080  
    - **Sector**: Housing Finance  
    - **Thoughts**: AAVAS targets affordable housing, a resilient segment. At ₹1,454, your entry is moderate, but NBFCs have faced interest rate sensitivity. Its small allocation limits its impact on your portfolio—review asset quality and loan growth.

11. **NTPC Green Energy Ltd**  
    - **138 shares @ ₹108** (IPO)  
    - **Cost**: ₹14,904  
    - **Sector**: Renewable Energy  
    - **Thoughts**: NTPC Green’s IPO listing in November 2024 was hyped, but your “😩” suggests it’s underwater (possibly trading below ₹108). Renewable energy is a long-term theme, but IPOs can be volatile initially. Hold on—NTPC’s backing and India’s green push could drive recovery.

#### Risk Factors
- **Concentration**: VBL (21% of invested capital) and Clean Science (15%) dominate your portfolio. A dip in either could amplify losses.
- **Volatility**: Jiofin, NTPC Green, and Laurus Labs are higher-risk bets due to evolving businesses or market sentiment.
- **Market Context**: Indian stocks faced a four-month losing streak into January 2025 (Reuters), suggesting broader pressure. Your 5% loss is moderate in this backdrop.",2025-03-02 17:54:42,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1j1wkis/portfolio_review/,IndianStockMarket

post,1hye4nh,The downfall of stock market ,bizhellboy,"New Delhi, Jan 10 (PTI) Investors' wealth tumbled Rs 12 lakh crore in three days of market slump due to uninterrupted foreign fund outflows and concerns over quarterly earnings.

Also, rising crude oil prices and a strengthening dollar index added to investors' pessimism.

In three days, the BSE benchmark Sensex tanked 820.2 points or 1.04 per cent.

On Friday, the 30-share BSE benchmark declined 241.30 points or 0.31 per cent to settle at 77,378.91. During the day, the benchmark gyrated 820.15 points between the day's high of 77,919.70 and low of 77,099.55.

The NSE Nifty dropped 95 points or 0.40 per cent to 23,431.50.

The market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms diminished by Rs 12,07,314.99 crore to Rs 4,29,67,835.05 crore (USD 5 trillion) in the three days.

From the 30-share blue-chip pack on Friday, Indusind Bank, NTPC, UltraTech Cement, State Bank of India, Sun Pharma, Axis Bank, Tata Steel and Power Grid were among the major laggards.

Tata Consultancy Services jumped nearly 6 per cent after the IT services company reported an 11.95 per cent surge in the December quarter net profit to Rs 12,380 crore.

Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities, said, ""Strong quarterly earnings from TCS drove the IT index up 3.4 per cent, helping the market withstand a sharp sell-off.""

However, despite broad gains across IT stocks, the Nifty fell for the third consecutive session, Vakil added.

Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech, Infosys and Bajaj Finserv were the

other big gainers.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth Rs 7,170.87 crore on Thursday, according to exchange data.

""Domestic market sentiment remained subdued due to rising crude oil prices, driven by supply concerns, and a strengthening dollar index. Despite the IT sector's resilience following positive early Q3 results, broader indices bled due to uncertainties surrounding Trump policies and high valuations.

""Consolidation may persist in the near term, yet investors are closely watching the US non-farm payroll data today for further guidance, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.

The BSE smallcap gauge dropped 2.40 per cent and midcap index declined 2.13 per cent.

Among BSE sectoral indices, power tanked 3.07 per cent, utilities (2.86 per cent), realty (2.64 per cent), industrials (2.08 per cent), commodities (2.05 per cent) and consumer durables (1.98 per cent).

BSE Focused IT jumped 3.17 per cent, IT (2.65 per cent) and teck (2.24 per cent) were the biggest gainers.

As many as 3,167 stocks declined while 827 advanced and 84 remained unchanged on the BSE.

""Markets continued its downward trajectory as the rupee dropping to new lows against the strengthening dollar has further dampened investors' sentiment. Amid concerns of subdued economic growth and expectations of a slowdown in the quarterly earnings, investors cut their bet on banking and mid & small cap stocks.",2025-01-10 20:30:26,32.0,12.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hye4nh/the_downfall_of_stock_market/,IndianStockMarket

After a prolonged bull run, NTPC is now exhibiting signs of weakness and potential reversal. The stock has broken its support level and closed below it, signaling a bearish sentiment. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.

Additionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance.",2024-12-27 12:19:32,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hndpnu/should_i_exit_my_long_position_in_ntpc_bearish/,StockMarketIndia

A good trustworthy management will have BSR good, and a bad management will have BSR poor. Let me know for which stocks you would want to know the BSR for.

We don't invest in stocks if the BSR signal is poor. Period. Doesn't matter which news covers them. Sales of a company is the King. But Capital Management is like Wisdom of a good king.

comment,1iqlj35,,,,,,,md1j1r8,SchpoopieScoopie,"Depends on your capital availability and what you have trailing behind you.

Having not analysed the companies individually and their price levels.

I am familiar with IDFC First Bank, Ola Electric, and JaiPrakash Power Ventures, you are in on the higher end.

IDFC has been trading between 55 and 65, Ola has been between 60-75, and Jaiprakash between 14-16.. so planning an exit on a bounce back might take time.

If you are a long term investor and can keep holding, I would advise you to analyse these companies and their long term outlook, and stay invested till they are back.

If they are bad companies and might take time to be profitable or be at an attractive valuation, then cut your losses.

Some stocks only exist just so the promoters can pay themselves/ fill their pockets

Very less trading activity (volumes) Few hands involved

post,1gtao4y,NTPC Green Energy IPO analysis and verdict,Lazy-Transition8236,"**1. Company fundamentals**

NTPC Green Energy Limited is owned by NTPC Limited. It is India's largest power generation company. The company has a lot of positives such as:

**Strong Parentage:** Company is backed by NTPC Limited, a state-owned enterprise, which provides NTPC Green with financial stability and access to resources.

**Company Growth:** NTPC Green Energy has seen a revenue growth rate of 46.82%, increasing from ₹910.42 crore in FY 2022 to ₹1,962.60 crore in FY 2024. The profit after tax has been growing at a CAGR of 90.75%, increasing from ₹94.74 crore in FY 2022 to ₹344.72 crore in FY 2024.

**Government Support:** The Indian government's emphasis on renewable energy and policies such as 24x7 power for all, Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, PLI schemes and multiple green energy schemes can benefit NTPC Green.

2. **Issue size and split**

The size of the IPO is Rs. 10000 crore and the minimum investment is Rs. 14,904 for retail investors.

The NTPC Green Energy IPO is a **purely fresh issue**, meaning there is **no Offer For Sale (OFS)** component. This is a huge green flag since we know that all proceeds from the IPO will go directly to the company and will not be cashed out by existing promoters.

3. **Brand name and experienced Management**

As mentioned earlier, the company is a subsidiary of state-owned NTPC Ltd. The key management team is experienced and has good expertise in the power sector.

The management is led by CEO Mr. Rajiv Gupta, CFO Mr. Neeraj Sharma and company secretary Mr. Manish Kumar.

4. **Valuation**

NTPC Green is aiming for a valuation of around $12 billion, which is one of the biggest valuations in the renewable energy sector.

The company's PE ratio of 260 is higher than its bigger competitor Adani Green Energy's PE ratio of 173. But the valuation can be considered reasonable, given the company's strong fundamentals, growth prospects, and the government's push for renewable energy.

5. **Clear Use of Proceeds**

The company proposes to use the proceeds from the IPO towards investment in the wholly-owned subsidiary, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (NREL), for repay debts of subsidiary NTPC Renewable Energy and the remaining for general corporate purposes.

While this may raise questions among investors, repayment of debts also comes with positives such as reduced loans, reduce in interest outflow for company and increase in profits after tax (PAT).

6. **Strong underwriting team**

Reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the IPO signal credibility and thorough due diligence.

The book-running lead managers or underwriters to the issue are IDBI Capital Market Services Limited, HDFC Bank Limited, IIFL Securities Ltd and Nuvama Wealth Management Limited. The issue's registrar is Kfin Technologies Limited.

7. **QIB subscription**

When the big players are subscribing in the beginning, without coming the last moment for filling the QIB quota, we can believing that QIBs are genuinely interested in the IPO and company. So observe the QIB subscription numbers throughout all 3 days of the IPO.

**Verdict**

This IPO is mostly positive, you can invest money according to your risk appetite or wait until the day of listing if at all you feel that the listing is about to happen at a discounted price.",2024-11-17 10:20:11,4.0,11.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1gtao4y/ntpc_green_energy_ipo_analysis_and_verdict/,IndianStreetBets

post,1gu4g2n,What went wrong with NTPC stock?,munnabhaiengineer,"I'm assuming the stock went up before going down because of the NTPC GREEN shareholder quota record date and I was under the impression that there's gonna be a sell off after the record date for the IPO, but the stock started going down even before that (we can attribute it to the market going down in general or is it something else too?) and continues to do so. The stock closed at 366.70 today which is almost 17% down from 440 (ATH) which it achieved on 30 September 2024.

After a prolonged bull run, NTPC is now exhibiting signs of weakness and potential reversal. The stock has broken its support level and closed below it, signaling a bearish sentiment. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.

Additionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance.",2024-12-27 12:25:57,1.0,4.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1hndt52/should_i_exit_my_long_position_in_ntpc_bearish/,IndianStreetBets

comment,1ev8fhk,,,,,,,lipusqs,parabola9999,"I assumed, sorry if it ticked you off the wrong way. The statement was meant in jest, clearly our senses of humor differ considerably. 

1. Again, not a Covid investor myself, but the assumption that risks are necessary for market-beating rewards is not a sane theory. You can, and should, aim to beat the markets at your ideal risk appetite, and then compare the risk-reward against your beta when benchmarking. This is, in essence, the efficient market hypothesis.

2. Red and green hota rehta hai. Good that you're enjoying tropical paradise abhi, and congrats on the same. But Bees is just a basket of stocks, and nothing more than that. It's not inherently bad, it's like trading on an index-linked ETF when you don't have a clear picture about the constituents, but like the theme. Sure, individual components within a basket of stocks will definitely overperform the average, but it also protects you from underperformance.

post,1k6jmdv,Top 10 Indian Company News - 2025-04-24,ecofaille,"Here's a summary of the top 10 most important news items concerning Indian publicly listed companies from today's exchange circulars:

1.  **Jubilant Agri:** Ordered by the High Court of Karnataka to deposit ₹4 Crore by June 9, 2025, in an ongoing dispute with Shivashakthi Builders. This deposit is a condition for staying a money decree of ₹8 Crore awarded to Shivashakthi Builders. This event has a potential to negatively affect the fundamentals of the company.

2.  **Suzlon Energy:** Secured a 378 MW wind energy project order from NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL). Suzlon will supply 120 S144 Wind Turbine Generators (WTG) for a project in Karnataka. This order reinforces Suzlon's position in India's renewable energy transition.

3.  **Orient Cement & Ambuja Cements:** Rukmani Birla Educational Society, Shri Jagannath Educational Institute, Shri Venkateshwara Educational Institute, Sri Govinddeo Educational Institute, Calcutta Hospital Institute, Calcutta Medical Institute, Shri Lakshminarayan Educational Institute and Shri Hari Om Educational Institute sold their stakes in Orient Cement to Ambuja Cements via off-market transfers. Ambuja Cements acquired a total of 9.97% stake in Orient Cement from these educational institutes.

4.  **Tata Communications:** Incorporated a new wholly-owned step-down subsidiary in China, 'TC (Shanghai) Network Services Company Limited', to provide telecommunications and digital services. This expansion allows Tata Communications to directly cater to the growing demand in China.

5.  **Tata Communications:** Stake in its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, NetFoundry Inc., diluted from 100% to 11.49% after NetFoundry Inc. secured funding through the issuance of new shares to venture capital firms SYN Ventures & LDV Partners. This will directly affect the revenue of Tata Communications due to reduced ownership.

6.  **Aurobindo Pharma:** Eugia Pharma Specialities Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary, received USFDA approval for Dasatinib Tablets, targeting a $1.8 billion market. This approval allows Caplin Steriles to enter this market, potentially increasing revenue and profitability.

7.  **Apollo Pipes:** Allotted 2,000,000 Fully Convertible Warrants to KITARA PIIN 2401, a non-promoter entity, at Rs. 550 per warrant. This allotment will increase the company's paid-up equity share capital to Rs. 46,04,82,060 on a fully diluted basis. This increase in equity base is likely to affect the earnings per share of the company.

8.  **Lupin Diagnostics:** Achieved 100% NABL accreditation across all its greenfield labs. This accreditation should improve the revenue of the company as more patients and doctors are likely to prefer the services of the company.

9.  **Optiemus Infracom:** Optiemus Unmanned Systems (OUS), a wholly-owned subsidiary, launched four new advanced drones for defense, surveillance, and reconnaissance and partnered with Taiwan-based Avix Technology. This development is likely to positively impact the company's revenue streams by expanding its product portfolio and tapping into the growing demand for indigenous defense solutions.

10. **Rajesh Power Services:** Secured new orders worth ₹1,116 Crores from government and institutional clients for power transmission and distribution projects in Gujarat. This significant order inflow is expected to positively impact Rajesh Power Services' revenue stream.
