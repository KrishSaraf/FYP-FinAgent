post,1kl181u,Why ONGC?,Ok_Set_6991,"**Oscillating oil prices will impact some stocks in different ways. But ONGC?**

Pros:

* Achieved production revival and reversed multi-year production decline. Oil fields like KG-98/2 have boosted the production output.
* The company has become financially stronger with a 5-year profit CAGR of 11%, average ROE at 12.6%, and ROCE 15%. ONGC's profit dipped in FY24 due to lower oil prices. But FY25 has seen a turnaround, with oil output increasing 1% and gas volumes stabilizing courtesy of KG-98/2 and Mumbai High.
* The company is also aggressively expanding, bidding for 19 blocks under OALP IX and it's also laying the groundwork for the future with ONGC Green, targeting 10 GW of renewable capacity and 1 MTPA of green hydrogen by 2030.

Cons:

* As seen earlier, net profit dropped in FY24 due to low oil prices and high depreciation.
* For upstream giants like ONGC, there's a commodity price risk. For every US$ 5/bbl drop in Brent, there can be an 8-10% decrease in EPS.

Thankfully, the company has no other fundamental cons except for risk in commodity prices.

ONGC just got a govt approval to charge a 20% premium on gas produced from new wells!

Not only that, ONGC's ***Future OI shows that almost 7 crore contracts are short ONGC!!*** 🤣🤣🤣

post,1i2suv1,Where is ONGC headed?,Ok_Set_6991,"Few positives:

*  Stock is trading at 0.94 times its book value and at a PE ratio of 7.36, indicating that the share price is not overvalued.
* Dividend payout is decent at 4.65%
* Debt to equity ratio is low (*0.02*)

One negative is that the revenue has seen a stagnation and then a slight decline for the past 2 quarters.

Additionally, Jefferies has issued a fresh note reiterating its buy recommendation for ONGC, projecting a potential 56% upside. The firm believes the recent correction in ONGC's shares, which seemed overdone, presents a buying opportunity.

post,1iocuo4,"ONGC-NTPC's ₹6,600 Crore Green Energy Deal-A Big Move",Piyush4758,"
ONGC-NTPC Buys Ayana Renewable for ₹6,600 Crore*

ONGC NTPC Green Pvt. Ltd (ONGPL) is making a massive push into renewable energy by acquiring Ayana Renewable Power for ₹6,600 crore. This deal is one of the largest in India's green energy sector. Ayana, backed by National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), also has investments from the UK’s British International Investment (BII) and Eversource Capital, which together put $1 billion into the company.

Big Plans for Green Energy Growth

Ayana currently has a 4.1 GW portfolio of solar and wind projects in states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat. It plans to expand to 10 GW by 2025. Meanwhile, NTPC already has 14.69 GW of renewable energy capacity and aims to reach 60 GW by 2032. This acquisition is a key milestone for ONGPL, accelerating its journey toward clean energy.

Why This Deal Matters?

India's renewable energy sector is booming, with a total capacity of 217.62 GW. In 2024 alone, solar energy grew by 24.5 GW, and wind energy by 3.4 GW. With rising power demand, more companies are entering this space. Recent deals include JSW Neo Energy buying O2 Power for $1.47 billion and Actis LLP acquiring Stride Climate Investments for $325 million.

India’s Green Energy Future

With this acquisition, ONGC and NTPC are strengthening their commitment to net-zero emissions by 2038 and 2050, respectively. As the country shifts towards cleaner energy, such big deals will play a crucial role in shaping India’s sustainable future.

Jefferies has issued a fresh note reiterating its buy recommendation for ONGC, projecting a potential 58% upside. The firm believes the recent correction in ONGC's shares, which seemed excessive, presents a recovery opportunity.

Let's see what the chart is saying : ONGC has recently corrected by around 36% but has shown significant upward momentum over the past two days. The price is currently positioned at the Fibonacci golden zone, a critical level indicating a possible trend reversal. Moreover, a clear RSI divergence on the daily time frame adds to the bullish sentiment.

The stock has successfully closed above the 40 EMA and 20 SMA on the daily chart, signaling positive momentum. However, for a decisive move upward, ONGC needs to break through the key resistance level at ₹267, coinciding with the 40-week EMA.

The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) supports this outlook, with a new buy signal on the weekly time frame and continued buy mode on the daily chart. A close above ₹267 could pave the way for a strong upward rally.",2025-01-03 13:37:23,3.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hsmmo0/ongc_promises_upside_says_jefferies_oil_india/,IndianStockMarket

post,1gs3ewm, Day -1: Buying 1 stock a day based on Reddit Recommendations! ,Few-Bank-8238,"Hey fellow investors! I'm starting an new challenge to buy 1 stock a day.

The premise is simple - every day, I'm going to buy 1 stock based on recommendations from the Reddit community. But the amount I invest will depend on how confident I am in the recommendation.

Here's how it will work:

\- Each day, I'll go through stock recommendations in this post or the series of post in the challenge and do my own research.

\- Based on that research, I'll decide to buy either:

1. 1 share of the stock
2. 1,000 rs worth of the stock
3. 5,000 rs worth of the stock
4. 10,000 rs worth of the stock
5. If the stock is above 10k, decision will be based on my discretion.

\- I'll keep a detailed tracker of every stock I buy - the ticker, people who recommended it, the amount invested, the reasoning behind my investment level, and the stock's performance over time.

The goal is to see if crowdsourced stock tips from Reddit, combined with my own due diligence, can outperform the market.

So hit me with your best stock recommendations and let's get investing! Make sure to include a brief explanation of why you think the stock is a good buy. I'll be posting the purchase each day and will be tracking the performance of all the stocks purchased through this challenge.

**Background**:

I have not invested much in Indian stock market and want to get into it. While I have started investing in index funds, I want to get better at stock picking(Haven't done fundamental analysis till date), wanted to see if crowd sourced intelligence is better than big fund managers. More importantly I want to get better at 1. finding good stocks with potential and 2. Doing good due diligence on stocks. I am planning to put up a max of 25l in this challenge in 1 year or about 10k per day.

**Updates**: Thanks everyone for the recommendations, we have 70 recommendations so far, which would cover almost 3 months,  have collated all recommendations into [Recommendations sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b0A-D70QUH6Y1f2ET_MjeSk_iPdG1lPBqkVomums85Q/edit?usp=sharing), please let me know if I have missed anything, will stop scraping this post going forward.

**P.S**: Good that I had already added case for stock above 10k, I am not going to look into elcid investments and MRF.

**P.P.S**: Will update link for day 0 on Monday in this thread.

post,1iz8i0q,Sold everything - booked 90k loss today and still happy,curioussharma-007,"Hey,

If you are following me in my last posts, I have been doing short selling and cleared 8L in gross profits this month alone. However i entered market in September as an equity investor, started with 12L worth of stocks, they  reached 9L, took loss and finally today booked final loss of 90K.



https://preview.redd.it/x2ac8m4i8mle1.png?width=2574&format=png&auto=webp&s=9baf9a640657e3cb7ee1d9cc63f6a62427b27876

and these are my futures positions as of 10:46 AM today:

https://preview.redd.it/zlcg6zgw8mle1.jpg?width=1023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4abd4aa2fb2c6ba928b7a3a74c5f9bfa9531f70

  
Point being:

People who are asking you to hold, think about it. The fall of market from September till now and in order to make some profits (if you invested after September, 2024) you first need to get NIFTY up at September levels to break even and then further up to make some profit.

Now i only hold 1 Gold ETF and the way I see the market, its going to bleed. As a short seller even 1 day of bleed is a day of immense returns.

There are many new investors sitting on huge loses with confused mind. My POV is, if you need money, take loss, if you can learn shorting then take loss and short however if that is your 'non active' money which you don't care for then let it be there however I don't think should listen to people who use the word 'average it', average of - is the -.

Another point of making this post is, to keep my action today on records permanently so 1 year from now I can look back and conclude on this decision.

Money freed from above stock sales is reinvested as 'shorting' in VOLTAS MAR FUT and HERO MOTOCOP MAR FUT (up by 4k at this moment)

post,1dy3b7h,What are your bullish stocks? Here's mine,NoraEmiE,"What are your bullish stocks? 

NBCC, 
Marksans Pharma, 
Berger Paints, 

Personally, I have NBBC in my list, and it got orders, so gonna keep it for some more. 
Other than that I might invest in Marksans Pharma and maybe Berger paints stocks for short term. 
And GMR for long term maybe.
Nothing confirmed yet, and This is all I got with my limited analyzing.

Howa about you all? What are your bullish stocks? 
And budget is going to be on 23rd. 
Today's market open seems to be going bit slow comparing to last weeks. 

Are you guys gonna go in now, or wait till budget? Please do mention the details such as target and time range short/long term as well.
My target is not really that long term. Max 1yr or 1.5year.

Check out my other post to see my portfolio if interested! Appreciate it!!

Try buying Meta at $80 dollars when it has fallen from multiple hundreds or buying Manappuram at 80 Rupees when it crashed from 220. Or even itc at 200. That's actual value. Most stocks (around 80%)today in Indian stock exchanges are either overvalued or above medium fair value range. When you buy such stocks, expect 10-20 percent CAGR, provided there is no crash for the next few years. If you had bought actual value, you'll end up making at least 30-40% CAGR.

post,1ip2vxn,US will announce list of tariffs on 1st April (countrywise) - Good news for short sellers,curioussharma-007,"https://preview.redd.it/dpq0dze8b1je1.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=8699538a109a1127c6749197786a0b44fb3e8d1e

  
Hey,,  
If you are into short selling like me (and making money in last 2 months), the good news is that US has announced reciprocal tariffs and it will share details on 1st April (country wise), India is already knows as 'Tariff king' as said by Trump.

As a short seller who use AI a lot, here's my research for possible shorting oppurtunity:

# Which Indian Sectors Are at Risk for Tariffs?

Given Trump's trade policies and focus on protecting American industries, these sectors are the most likely targets for tariffs:

# 1. Pharmaceuticals (Exports: $7.55 billion) – High Risk

* The U.S. imports a massive amount of **generic drugs** from India.
* Trump has pushed for **onshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing** in the U.S.
* **Likely action**: Higher tariffs on **generic medicines** from India to protect U.S. pharma firms.

# 2. Precious Metals & Stones (Exports: $10.17 billion) – Moderate-High Risk

* India is one of the biggest exporters of **cut and polished diamonds** to the U.S.
* Trump previously **increased tariffs on Chinese jewelry**; he may do the same to India.
* **Likely action**: Tariffs on **diamonds and jewelry** to promote local manufacturing.

# 3. Electrical & Electronic Equipment (Exports: $9.89 billion) – Moderate-High Risk

* Includes **Motherson Sumi, ABB India, and Exide Industries**.
* India exports **electronic components and auto electronics**, competing with U.S. firms.
* **Trump previously targeted China with tech-related tariffs.**
* **Likely action**: Import duties on **Indian auto electronics, semiconductors, and batteries**.

# 4. Automotive & Auto Parts (Exports: $2.58 billion) – Moderate Risk

* **Hero MotoCorp** and **Motherson Sumi** export motorcycles and auto components.
* Trump previously **imposed tariffs on European & Chinese auto imports**.
* **Likely action**: Tariffs on **Indian two-wheelers and auto components** to support U.S. manufacturers.

# 5. Textiles & Apparel (Exports: $2.64 billion) – Moderate Risk

* India is a **top textile and apparel exporter** to the U.S.
* Trump **previously imposed tariffs on China’s textile exports**.
* **Likely action**: Higher duties on **Indian garments** to boost U.S. production.

# 6. Oil & Petrochemicals (Exports: $6.52 billion) – Low-Moderate Risk

* **Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and ONGC** export refined petroleum to the U.S.
* The U.S. wants **energy independence**, so **tariffs on Indian oil** could be possible.
* **Likely action**: A tariff on **Indian refined oil products**, but impact may be low.

# 7. IT & Software Services (Not in the export goods list, but a huge sector) – Low Risk

* India dominates **IT services and outsourcing** for American companies.
* Instead of tariffs, Trump might **tighten visa rules (H-1B restrictions)**.

However, this is just one parameter, rest you can check in weekly which stocks are already going down and on daily check if they are over bought, this given oppurtunity to enter the market>

I am not against Indian market, I am just a trader who makes money on both sides and right now for this year I am highly bearish.

comment,1j1rnkw,,,,,,,mfmxduh,SubstantialRest7116,"### Portfolio Overview
You’ve invested in 14 assets: 12 individual stocks, 1 sectoral ETF (Nifty SBI ETF), and 1 gold ETF (Gold Bees). Total allocation sums to 100%, so I assume this is your full portfolio. Here’s the breakdown by sector/type based on your holdings:

- **Energy/PSUs**: NTPC (6.64%), NTPC Green (9.28%), ONGC (6.97%), IOC (4.81%), IRFC (5.56%) – **33.26%**
- **Finance**: SBI (7.66%), Manappuram (6.13%), Bajaj Housing Finance (2.55%) – **16.34%**
- **Pharma**: Dr. Reddy’s (5.82%), Natco Pharma (6.96%) – **12.78%**
- **Auto**: Tata Motors (9.41%) – **9.41%**
- **IT**: Wipro (7.23%) – **7.23%**
- **FMCG**: ITC (4.87%) – **4.87%**
- **ETFs**: Nifty SBI ETF (6.02%), Gold Bees (9.96%) – **15.98%**

**Key Observations**:
- Heavy PSU exposure (33.26%), especially energy-related (NTPC, ONGC, IOC, IRFC).
- Diversified across sectors, but concentrated in a few stocks (e.g., NTPC Green, Tata Motors, Gold Bees each ~9-10%).
- Current ETF allocation (Nifty SBI + Gold Bees) is ~16%, with intent to increase it.

### Performance Context: Down 20% Since July 2024
You started investing in July 2024, and as of March 2, 2025 (8 months later), you’re down 20%. Let’s contextualize this:
- **Market Trends (July 2024–March 2025)**: The Nifty 50, a broad market benchmark, grew ~5-7% in this period (based on historical trends and assuming no major crash by March 2025). However, midcaps, smallcaps, and PSUs (where you’re heavily invested) saw volatility—some PSU stocks corrected 15-25% after a 2023-early 2024 rally.
- **Your Portfolio**: A 20% loss suggests your picks underperformed the broader market, likely due to sector-specific declines or stock selection.

**Is This Normal?**: For a beginner starting mid-2024:
- Yes, it’s possible. Markets don’t always go up, and 2024 saw profit booking in PSU and midcap stocks after a multi-year bull run.
- No, it’s not ideal. A 20% drop against a flat-to-up broader market indicates some stock-specific or allocation issues.

**Red Flags**:
- **Wipro**: IT sector faced headwinds in 2024 (US slowdown, fewer contracts). Fundamentally weaker than peers.
- **PSU Overweight (IRFC, NTPC, ONGC, IOC)**: 2024 saw PSU profit-taking after a 2023 boom—your timing might’ve coincided with this.
- No glaring “wrong” stocks, but high exposure to volatile PSUs and midcaps likely amplified your loss.


- **Current Volatility**: 
  - PSU-heavy (33%) and midcaps (e.g., Manappuram, Natco) are volatile—20% drop reflects this.
  - Gold Bees (10%) and Nifty SBI ETF (6%) are stabilizers, but 16% isn’t enough to offset stock-specific risk.
- **Plan to Increase Nifty ETF & Gold**:
  - **Nifty ETF**: Tracks Nifty 50, low volatility (~15-20% annualized), diversified across sectors. Increasing this (e.g., to 15-20%) balances your PSU tilt.
  - **Gold**: Low correlation to stocks, hedges inflation. Boosting to 15% (from 10%) makes sense—gold’s uptrend in 2024 supports this.
- **Suggestion**: Trim high-risk stocks (e.g., NTPC Green, Tata Motors—your 9%+ bets) to fund ETFs. Aim for 20% Nifty ETF + 15% Gold (35% low-volatility assets).

### My View on Your Portfolio
- **Strengths**: Decent diversification (energy, finance, pharma, etc.), some defensive picks (ITC, Gold), PSU exposure taps government growth themes.
- **Weaknesses**: 
  - Overweight PSUs (33%) at a volatile time—your 20% loss likely stems from this correction.
  - High single-stock bets (9-10% in Tata Motors, NTPC Green) amplify risk for a beginner.
  - Wipro’s underperformance is a weak link.
- **Is Something Wrong?**: Not fundamentally—your stocks aren’t “bad” picks. The issue is timing (bought at peaks?) and allocation (too much in volatile segments).
- **Normalcy**: A 20% drop in 8 months isn’t rare for a stock-heavy portfolio in a corrective phase, but it’s steeper than the market—adjustments can help.


### Recommendations
1. **Rebalance**:
   - Reduce NTPC Green, Tata Motors to 5-6% each.
   - Exit or trim Wipro (swap for a stronger IT stock like Infosys if you want IT).
   - Boost Nifty ETF to 15-20% and Gold Bees to 15%.
2. **Hold Steady**: ITC, Dr. Reddy’s, SBI, ONGC are solid—don’t panic-sell losses.
3. **Learn Timing**: Use SIPs for ETFs to avoid buying at peaks.
4. **Review**: Check your cost price vs. March 2025 levels—share specifics if you want deeper analysis.",2025-03-02 17:32:07,10.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1j1rnkw/would_love_to_hear_your_views_on_my_portfolio/,IndianStockMarket

post,1end0rm,Did i mess up buying during the dip?,ParticularClerk432,"M 24.

Hey guys, so i got some extra money to invest in the market and seeing the small dip thought it's a good time to buy some stocks. Need your opinion on wether i made the correct choice or not? (Edited this line)

Here's the list of stocks that i put a buying order for -

* coal india - 20 shares, each for - 525
* SBI - 10 shares, each for 810
* ONGC - 50 shares, each for 323
* NTPC - 40 shares, each for 407.55
* Tata steel - 20 shares, each for 151.12

I had some cash remaining in hand and saw some good dips on stocks that i had been looking at for a while and all of these had good fundamentals and were rated buy on indmoney and  [trendlyne](https://trendlyne.com/markets-today-loggedin/).

i am doubtful about my impromptu buying and i know that this can cause a lot of issues for me in the future if i don't learn the discipline to control myself. How can i get better at this and not jump into every chance i see?",2024-08-08 18:11:02,4.0,37.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1end0rm/did_i_mess_up_buying_during_the_dip/,IndianStockMarket

1. Consistent Divided payout - the company should have expressed an intention of paying out dividends in the future via a Dividend Payout Policy, what if the company stops paying dividend like Intel USA?

2. Future Prospects of the company - i also want the principle amount to grow as well, hence I invest in divided paying companies which have a future prospects; even if the share appreciates nominally, I'm fine with it.

Some examples of Dividend paying stocks in my portfolios are - REC, Coal India, PowerGrid, TCS, HCLTech & ITC. 

Apart from the equity part i also accumulate -
Embassy REIT & IndiGrid InvIT. Earlier I was also accumulating PowerGrid INVIT but then they expressed their intentions of not acquiring any assests in the medium term (which in my opinion was negative)

It's not a dividend per say, but it has 4 components
Interest on shareholders loan, dividend, repayment of shareholders loan, and interest on FD. 

They (have to) pay it quarterly. I have been investing a portion of sum in these since 2020. 

There are only 4 REITs and 2-3 InVITs. I have invested in Brookfield at 248 and it has more or less given Rs. 20 per year per share. It is also appreciated to 334 but currently hovering around 260. Lately I bought Nexus REIT (did a SIP) with avg that cost 121 and the all time high was 154..

Mind you, I see them as FD that gives me payout every quarter plus capital appreciation over a really long term (10-15 years)

post,1ig01p1,Rate My Portfolio: 17 Indian Stocks - From Power Grid to GG Engineering 🇮🇳 (Need Your Brutal Honesty!),Common-Technician121,"

My analysis: I have  Suzlon as my second-biggest holding while I also have Power Grid. It's like betting on both the past and future of Indian energy at the same time. But here's the real question: I am basically playing both sides of the energy transition? 

Power Grid is the 'boomer stock' that everyone's uncle recommends (steady dividends, government backing, can't go wrong), while Suzlon is the 'millennial renewable play' that could either 10x or go to zero. It's like having one foot in 1990 and another in 2050.

Before you forget about this post - I'm genuinely curious: What's everyone's take on this strategy? Is this brilliant diversification or just confusion? 🤔


Please be patient and read ahead main fun starts here ✌️

Hey r/IndianStockMarket! 

I've got a portfolio of 17 stocks that I've built up, and I could really use some experienced eyes on this. Currently sitting at ₹3.52L total value with about ₹2.25L invested (56% returns so far).

My biggest positions:
- Power Grid (400 shares)
- Suzlon Energy (1391 shares)
- Wipro (202 shares)

Some smaller bets:
- Various small positions in ITC, IEX, ONGC
- A few micro-positions like IDFC First Bank (1 share) and ITC Hotels (2 shares)

I'm particularly wondering:
1. Am I too diversified for a ₹3.5L portfolio?
2. What do you think about my heavy exposure to energy (Power Grid + Suzlon)?
3. Should I consolidate some of these smaller positions?
4. Any glaring red flags you see?
5. Your suggestion for improvements

Feel free to be brutally honest - I'm here to learn! 🙏

post,1dw2kvl,Kotak predicts a bleak future for Oil & Gas stocks. What's your take on it?,sandymartin07,"Recently, Kotak Institutional Equities suggested a 'Sell' rating on oil & gas stocks like IOC, BPCL, HPCL, GAIL, Oil India, and Petronet LNG, citing diminishing prospects of future growth beyond a limit. What do you make of it? I myself have fair exposure to some of these stocks and believe the energy & power sector isn't going to die out soon. Recently, they also had similar verdicts about Titan and Lupin, and the shares saw substantial movement the next day.

What is your opinion? Doesn't it look like these firms try to influence the market in some way?

Companies like IOCL, BPCL, HPCL etc are downstream oil companies. They buy crude oil from upstream companies, either domestic or foreign, refine it within their refineries, then transport the oil from their refineries to fuel stations all across the country.

Regarding the petrol/diesel price staying stable, that's by design.

post,1f8n5ow,Update!,Due_Training6535,"The Indian stock market is currently experiencing a mixed trend, with the Sensex down by 0.49% at 82,149.87 levels. The Nifty is also trading lower, at 25,100.
The decline in the market is primarily due to weak cues from Asia-Pacific markets, where Nikkei was down 4.3%, Kospi was down 3.04%, and ASX 200 was down 1.9%.
However, some sectors, such as SmallCap, Pharma, and Health, are showing gains.
 - Oil stocks drop up to 5% as crude prices plummet: ONGC, Chennai Petroleum Corporation, GAIL, and Oil India have all declined due to falling crude oil prices.
 - Cochin Shipyard shares tank 24% in one month: The company's shares have been under pressure due to concerns about its financial performance.
 - Indigo Paints and Asian Paints rally up to 6% amid declining crude prices: These companies are benefiting from lower input costs.
 - Raymond shares surge 8% in 2 days ahead of lifestyle business' listing: Investors are optimistic about the company's prospects.

post,1foy8g9,Buy multiple stocks but low quantity or single stock but higher quantity ? ,Username6ixty9ine,"Hi all, I have been investing in stock market as a student since 2021. 3 months ago, I got a job and now I am investing around 40k every month. I know people talk about diversifying your portfolio, and also it's best to buy a significant quantity of a stock for optimal gains. Should I buy multiple stocks lets say 3 stocks for 15k each or should I buy maybe a single one for 30k and maybe something else for 15k. 

I have tata motors, ongc, sbin, and bandhan bank in my portfolio. But the portfolio itself is just 1.2 lakhs as of now. Bought tata motors at 960, bandhan bank at 202, ONGC at 290 and SBIN at 785.

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

post,1i7zyvg,Growth vs Value stocks!,Embarrassed-Row4192,"1. Growth Stocks: Stocks of companies with high revenue and earnings growth potential. High risk play. (Future capital appreciation) 

Traits: High valuations, focus on capital appreciation, no/little dividends. 

Examples: Often in innovative or rapidly expanding sectors like technology & biotech. Tata Elxsi, Laurus Labs, KPIT technologies.

2. Value Stocks: Businesses trading below their intrinsic value, often in mature industries. Moderate risk play. (Undervalued opportunities with dividends). 

Traits: Low P/E or P/B ratios, potential for price appreciation. Companies in sectors like utilities or cyclical industries.

Examples: ITC, Coal India, ONGC.",2025-01-23 09:54:18,6.0,5.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1i7zyvg/growth_vs_value_stocks/,IndianStockMarket

post,1hsmkyn,"ONGC Promises Upside, Says Jefferies; Oil India Gains as Crude Breaches 100-DMA",ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/nt3lwnug7sae1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52c718bb227a9cea32a8f2cde134409d5e47213b

Jefferies has issued a fresh note reiterating its buy recommendation for ONGC, projecting a potential 58% upside. The firm believes the recent correction in ONGC's shares, which seemed excessive, presents a recovery opportunity.

Let's see what the chart is saying : ONGC has recently corrected by around 36% but has shown significant upward momentum over the past two days. The price is currently positioned at the Fibonacci golden zone, a critical level indicating a possible trend reversal. Moreover, a clear RSI divergence on the daily time frame adds to the bullish sentiment.

The stock has successfully closed above the 40 EMA and 20 SMA on the daily chart, signaling positive momentum. However, for a decisive move upward, ONGC needs to break through the key resistance level at ₹267, coinciding with the 40-week EMA.

The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) supports this outlook, with a new buy signal on the weekly time frame and continued buy mode on the daily chart. A close above ₹267 could pave the way for a strong upward rally.",2025-01-03 13:34:54,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hsmkyn/ongc_promises_upside_says_jefferies_oil_india/,StockMarketIndia

(1) . It is a PSU stock so any government policy change can have an impact on ONGC's growth and profit and 

(2.) ONGC is an upstream company. (Upstream refers to the initial stages of oil and gas production, like exploration and production) , so it is heavily affected by international crude oil price and global events can affect crude oil prices. Certain geographical events - political events in regions with large oil reserves can disrupt crude oil supply. Any war, pandemic, bad weather.

Same with KPIT, numbers and future prospects looks nice.

Slowly building positions in it.

Holding RVNL for more than a year, booked really nice profits and still holding some. They recently got new projects

ONGC seemed very fairly priced so slowly making positions

VBL financials also seemed good

Buidling position in goldbees to balance the portfolio

post,1hsmngh,"ONGC Promises Upside, Says Jefferies; Oil India Gains as Crude Breaches 100-DMA",ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/6y3v6za38sae1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa82c2a737928b65d94630a5e0076bf6e0b4cbb5

Jefferies has issued a fresh note reiterating its buy recommendation for ONGC, projecting a potential 58% upside. The firm believes the recent correction in ONGC's shares, which seemed excessive, presents a recovery opportunity.

Let's see what the chart is saying : ONGC has recently corrected by around 36% but has shown significant upward momentum over the past two days. The price is currently positioned at the Fibonacci golden zone, a critical level indicating a possible trend reversal. Moreover, a clear RSI divergence on the daily time frame adds to the bullish sentiment.

The stock has successfully closed above the 40 EMA and 20 SMA on the daily chart, signaling positive momentum. However, for a decisive move upward, ONGC needs to break through the key resistance level at ₹267, coinciding with the 40-week EMA.

The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) supports this outlook, with a new buy signal on the weekly time frame and continued buy mode on the daily chart. A close above ₹267 could pave the way for a strong upward rally.",2025-01-03 13:38:30,2.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1hsmngh/ongc_promises_upside_says_jefferies_oil_india/,IndianStreetBets

ONGC just got a govt approval to charge a 20% premium on gas produced from new wells! Now I know this news has already been covered in multiple posts today, BUT what isn't so obvious is the fact that there are ***A LOT OF CALLS OPTIONS that have been sold at 340 and above strike prices - around 3.5 crore call options*** have been sold between 340 to 350! Not only that, ONGC's ***Future OI shows that almost 7 crore contracts are short ONGC!!*** 🤣🤣🤣

The current market price has barely crossed 340 today and after today's news these short sellers are gonna cover so fast the stock price is likely to go up to 360 easily! 🚀

post,1g9nmbk,Planning to take 10L loan for long term( Oct - Dec time investment),rohit9967,"Hi Reddit family,

With the market trending down, I'm considering some promising stocks such as Tata Motors, CDSL, Bajaj Housing Finance, Castrol, TCS, ONGC, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Steel, UltraTech Cement, Reliance, Tata Tech, Tata Consumer Products, Britannia, Titan, IEX, Coal India, BEL, IOC, and Nifty ETFs.

These are potential stocks and indices I’m looking at, but I plan to narrow it down to just 10 for investment (mostly focusing on Tata stocks).

I’ve been investing for the long term over the past few years and am not in a rush to withdraw the invested money, as it’s meant solely for investment. Additionally, I can manage to pay off my loan in a few months (maximum 4-5 months).

I would appreciate your guidance on whether this is a good decision and any advice or suggestions you might have. 


I’m planning to invest between October and December, and I intend to hold some investments until the U.S. election period and results. What are your thoughts on this? Kindly guide me.

This is a legecy Advertising agency catering some of the biggest brands in India.

**Strength-** 

* The Core team sits in Chennai but still their hold on Govt & large clients from the Delhi NCR region is good.
* Legacy of being an old company with some of the industry pioneers.
* 360 degree ad-solution.

**Numbers-**

50 Cr Profit with around 350 cr Revenue in 2024 up from half in 2021.

**Reason for multi-bagger potential-**

Digital marketing & client ad-management is growing multifold every year. RKSwamy will take a large chunk out of that pie & will keep growing for years to come.

Currently I hold a decent Mutual fund portfolio with Xirr of 23% (as of today) and holds quite a few stocks which you can see in the SC.
I dont feel like my stocks have been performing good lately. They have been collectively giving me very reduced returns for a while now which is why I am here to ask you some suggestions. 
I have been thinking whether its a good idea to sell the stocks and invest those money in the better performing MF ? Or should I just hold to the stocks hoping for a good returns in the future?

comment,1h4r8d8,,,,,,,m00lv2c,docatwar,"If you don't know how to analyze stocks stick to MFs or index funds, you will get decent return with considerably less heartburn.

If you know how to analyze stocks then you can try to beat the index by doing your own research.

Frankly your stock holdings don't seem that great for a long term holder, but if you have a good reason to hold each of them it's fine.",2024-12-02 10:29:19,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1h4r8d8/stocks_or_mutual_funds/,IndianStreetBets
comment,1h4r8d8,,,,,,,m02vii0,docatwar,"First, decide if you want to be a trader (short term) or investor (long term holder).

If you want to be a trader, learn technical analysis, risk management etc (I am not a trader so I don't know about all this stuff).

If you want to be an investor, it is a long learning curve, a good place to start in my opinion is books by Parag Parikh, Peter Lynch and Warren Buffett, as they cover the classical value investment framework. There is a lot to learn in fundamental analysis, how to assess a company and value its stock. Also you might find that despite your best efforts it's not possible to beat the index and it might be best to just buy index funds or mutual funds.

It's a long journey, you will learn along the way.",2024-12-02 19:12:37,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1h4r8d8/stocks_or_mutual_funds/,IndianStreetBets

comment,1dkv7ig,,,,,,,l9loz4r,AdSpiritual2846,"Since your portfolio (by a quick glance) seems to be heavily curated towards finance, I think it's decent. Can you tell me the weighted average PE and PEG ratio for your portfolio.

Also, don't hold PSUs and IT as of now. They are highly overvalued. This is a bull market where even a paanwala can make money. The markets can crash anytime with a trigger. So be prepared for a 20-40% dip on your portfolio. 

Having said this,  since you're just 18, I'll advise not to invest all your money in the market. Also, try to invest in skills rather than the market at this stage. If you're interested in finance, try to study it. Books like Damodaran etc are classics. It will help you understand valuations. I read it more than a decade back. It's still a classic. Investing is not easy. It looks easy in a bull market where everything has shot through the roof.

Also, 3 years is not a long term horizon. It's a mid-term, time frame. When the markets crash, which they will, there is no time-frame as to how long will they take to reach back to previous levels.

post,1fnix3x,What can be long term stocks now,Homeless-Grandfather,"I have built this portfolio by investing 5k-10k each month for more than 1 year during my internship. Now I am working full time and have more capacity to invest. 

I am looking for long horizon investments. I am sitting on 30-40% cash right now and looking to diversify my portfolio as you can see it is concentrated on Financials and Financial Services heavily. 

I am an investor who likes to buy beaten down stocks, which have good fundamentals but are not in heavy demand right now. 

Have the following sectors in my mind: 

1. Heard alot of steel sector rotation. Thinking of HINDZINC. Dominant player of silver and zinc production. 

2. a) IONEXCHANGE. Water treatment will have growing demand in future. b) JASH INDUSTRIES is involved in manufacturing water pumping and other related machines. 

3. ONGC holds 71% share in crude oil and natural gas production. Gas demand will go up for CNG cars as they are more affordable and do not require EV stations infra. 

4. Please suggest pharmacy/health stocks as Apollo, max all seem highly inflated. I had booked 30% profits on ICICIPRULI this quarter. 

5. Glazing defense stocks as they are beaten down. 

Please suggest any improvements I should make to my pf!!!",2024-09-23 12:13:33,1.0,8.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1fnix3x/what_can_be_long_term_stocks_now/,IndianStreetBets

comment,1fnix3x,,,,,,,loiqbp5,ultramagician,Rakesh exports hasn’t been rising even in this bull market because of poor management. HUL and Asian paints would never go down. But they don’t have much growth options. They are already industry leaders and can’t expand anymore.,2024-09-23 13:10:23,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1fnix3x/what_can_be_long_term_stocks_now/,IndianStreetBets
