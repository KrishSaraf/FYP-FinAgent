comment,1ftk1g0,,,,,,,lpsm8ok,Old-Conflict6423,"The 5 stocks which you have filtered Tata motors is good one for start with. and as you are starting only you should start with stable company only so that you don't get scared by the volatility in the market. 

Why I am saying that Tata motor will be good stock to buy is because TM have very stable financials with stable ownership, 3 year Sales growth & Profit growth is 20.58% & 64.4% Respectively. 

3 year ROE & ROCE is also around 10%. 

You can analyse all this company by yourself so that you can get a good idea about all this companies. I Personally use Finology TICKER for all my research work it is very useful for research work and very simple & easy to use. I would highly suggest you to give a try once.

post,1h729kj,I think I will Exit Apollo Tyres and Enter TataMotors,trippyleg,"Around 2 months back I invested in Apollo Tyre when it broke 500 mark on the downside. My initial plan was to be invested in it for 1 to 2 years. You can read my reasons below through the link.

Do let me know your thoughts and suggestions.



[My Post on Apollo Tyres](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g3awv6/is_apollo_tyres_a_smart_investment_right_now/)

But now that it has given around 10 percent return in the period; considering the current market, I think i should get out of it, book profit and look at other avenues.

I have been looking at the automobile sector after the recent pull back due to low sales numbers. The 2 wheeler sector looks attractive and Mahindra(for 4 wheelers and CV) seems to be making all the headlines. But i would like to stay clear of the hype.

For me TataMotors at the current level (783)  looks attractive with the valuation. It does have slow growth currently, but it may pick up with the new year sales. Also there is room to improve and capture segment in the low cost EV segment if it goes ahead with its plan to bring in another option at the Tiago level. Which may be a direct competitor for Maruti Celerio and others in the segment.

Also with the plan to demerge the PV and CV segment may act as a trigger. 

On the negative side; Trump taking office in January looks bad for cars manufactured outside USA (in the US market).

  
Note: M&M does look attractive; but the most important reason I am staying away from it is the hype created by the anchors and analyst.",2024-12-05 05:48:47,0.0,4.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1h729kj/i_think_i_will_exit_apollo_tyres_and_enter/,IndianStockMarket

Write a ten line pov on what will happen to Tata Motors' fundamental business.

(a) Will India buy more and more commercial vehicles.. and of what size? Look at the trends... Think what will happen vis-a-vis long haul travel vs short haul travel.... Will Tata remain the preferred CV player?
(b) Will India be a Hybrid play or an EV play.. and within that... Is there really a big differentiation amongst players. If Maruti can just as well catch up to Tata in EV in three years... What are you paying for? (See how post investments by Ford... Chevrolet.. etc.. delta between value of these players and Tesla has come down.)

post,1gs3ewm, Day -1: Buying 1 stock a day based on Reddit Recommendations! ,Few-Bank-8238,"Hey fellow investors! I'm starting an new challenge to buy 1 stock a day.

The premise is simple - every day, I'm going to buy 1 stock based on recommendations from the Reddit community. But the amount I invest will depend on how confident I am in the recommendation.

Here's how it will work:

\- Each day, I'll go through stock recommendations in this post or the series of post in the challenge and do my own research.

\- Based on that research, I'll decide to buy either:

1. 1 share of the stock
2. 1,000 rs worth of the stock
3. 5,000 rs worth of the stock
4. 10,000 rs worth of the stock
5. If the stock is above 10k, decision will be based on my discretion.

\- I'll keep a detailed tracker of every stock I buy - the ticker, people who recommended it, the amount invested, the reasoning behind my investment level, and the stock's performance over time.

The goal is to see if crowdsourced stock tips from Reddit, combined with my own due diligence, can outperform the market.

So hit me with your best stock recommendations and let's get investing! Make sure to include a brief explanation of why you think the stock is a good buy. I'll be posting the purchase each day and will be tracking the performance of all the stocks purchased through this challenge.

**Background**:

I have not invested much in Indian stock market and want to get into it. While I have started investing in index funds, I want to get better at stock picking(Haven't done fundamental analysis till date), wanted to see if crowd sourced intelligence is better than big fund managers. More importantly I want to get better at 1. finding good stocks with potential and 2. Doing good due diligence on stocks. I am planning to put up a max of 25l in this challenge in 1 year or about 10k per day.

**Updates**: Thanks everyone for the recommendations, we have 70 recommendations so far, which would cover almost 3 months,  have collated all recommendations into [Recommendations sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b0A-D70QUH6Y1f2ET_MjeSk_iPdG1lPBqkVomums85Q/edit?usp=sharing), please let me know if I have missed anything, will stop scraping this post going forward.

**P.S**: Good that I had already added case for stock above 10k, I am not going to look into elcid investments and MRF.

**P.P.S**: Will update link for day 0 on Monday in this thread.

post,1i75bgk,My market view to help crying investors,According_Bear1543,"I saw lot of investors crying here, so I am sharing my view.

Atleast its better to do this, rather than do randi rona on GDP and Inflation which most maha gyaanis do here.

They have made this sub as essay writing competition for their Harvard thesis, instead of sharing to-the-point market views.

..........................................................................................................................................................................

I believe NIFTY is going to complete its 5-3-5 correction (google for more details) soon.

It may end around 22300 on NIFTY and 46000 on BANKNIFTY.

When it will happen -> Between 30th Jan to 5th Feb

After this we will see a bounce/rally for 4-6 weeks minimum. Whether this will be the final bottom is not clear yet.

This is what happens when you jump to stock investing without knowledge.

post,1fqdl1b,"Rev/iew my port/folio please, 28 , No background of investment, Self Made so far, Goal - 1cr before 30 ",rohit9967,"Hi Reddit Family,

A bit of context about myself:

I come from a humble background, without any financial inheritance or prior knowledge of investing. I’ve worked hard to support my family and am currently responsible for my parents and others close to me. At 28, Single and working full-time, I started investing around 2-3 years ago with no prior experience, learning through Reddit, YouTube, and books.

My focus is on long-term growth, with a goal of reaching 1cr before I turn 30. Achieving this would provide me with a sense of financial security and peace of mind.

Treat me someone who is eager to learn but lacking good network or friends to guide me through these decisions. Your advice would mean a lot to me.

Current status of my monthly investment :

* Nifty 50 SIP - Monthly (20k) 
* Nifty next 50 SIP - Monthly (20k) 
* Additional stocks investment - (10k)

Specifically, I would appreciate your thou/ghts on the following:

1. How do you eval/uate my current port/folio, and what improvements could I make?
2. What actions or strategies should I focus on to potentially reach 1cr before 30? Additionally, how much more investment would be necessary to achieve that goal, currently investing around \~50/month?
3. I will be receiving a bonus of approximately 8L next month, what would be the best strategy to invest it wisely?

Thank you for your time and expertise. Happy to hear your thou/ghts on how I can improve my approach and avoid common mistakes :)",2024-09-27 02:30:06,56.0,30.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fqdl1b/review_my_portfolio_please_28_no_background_of/,IndianStockMarket

I suggest you avoid chasing higher returns by taking unnecessary risks, like investing in penny stocks or derivatives for short-term gains. These can lead to significant losses over time. Instead, focus on consistently growing your capital. Regular investments in mutual funds, combined with a little exposure to stocks (if you understand them), can be a more sustainable way to create wealth.

post,1fi4bzl,Good news for Ola and other Indian EVs ,just1acc,"China has recently instructed its automakers to avoid making electric vehicle (EV) investments in India, a decision that could significantly impact the growing electric mobility industry in both countries. As **EV News 2024** develops, this move comes amid heightened geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions between the two nations, and it raises important questions about the future of the electric vehicle sector.

In this article, we’ll explore the reasons behind China’s decision, its potential effects on the **Top Electric Vehicles**, and how it might change the landscape of [**Top Electric Vehicles News**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/). We’ll also dive into how India’s EV market will evolve without China’s influence and what this could mean for **Best Electric Vehicles Price**, **Best Electric Vehicles Blogs**, and **Top Electric Vehicles Brands**.

# The Geopolitical Context Behind China’s Move

The decision from the Chinese government comes at a time when relations between India and China are strained due to territorial disputes, economic competition, and growing concerns about trade imbalances. Over the past few years, India has taken steps to reduce its reliance on Chinese products and investments, particularly in critical sectors like telecommunications, infrastructure, and electric vehicles.

This backdrop of political and economic tension has led China to discourage its automakers from investing in India’s burgeoning EV market. The Chinese government fears that investing in India could expose its companies to risk and undermine its geopolitical standing. This directive has had a direct impact on **Top Electric Vehicles Brands** and **Top Electric Cars Brands**, as many of these brands are looking to expand internationally. India, being one of the [**largest emerging EV markets**](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/trends-in-electric-cars), was a prime target for these investments.

# Impact on India’s Electric Vehicle Market

India has been rapidly expanding its EV industry, aiming to become a global leader in clean energy and electric mobility. The country has introduced various incentives, subsidies, and schemes to attract both domestic and international investments in its EV sector. China’s decision to halt EV investments could slow down the progress in this sector, particularly for companies that were hoping to leverage Chinese technology and expertise.

Without the backing of Chinese automakers, Indian manufacturers will need to rely more heavily on domestic resources and partnerships with non-Chinese companies. This could open up opportunities for other global **Top Electric Vehicles Brands**, such as Tesla, Rivian, and European automakers, to fill the gap left by Chinese firms. Additionally, Indian startups in the EV space may now have a better shot at capturing a significant share of the market, potentially impacting [**Best Electric Vehicles Price**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/top-electric-vehicles-blog/) and availability.

# Indian EV Manufacturers to Watch

Several Indian companies are already making waves in the **Top Electric Vehicles** sector, and they are likely to benefit from China’s decision to step back. Key players include:

1. [**Tata Motors**](https://www.tatamotors.com/): A leading name in the [**Best Electric SUV**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/what-is-the-best-electric-suv-in-2024/) category with the Tata Nexon EV, one of the most popular electric cars in India.
2. [**Mahindra Electric**](https://www.mahindraelectricautomobile.com/): Known for its commitment to green mobility, Mahindra Electric is one of the strongest competitors in the Indian EV space.
3. [**Ola Electric**](https://www.olaelectric.com/): Primarily focused on electric two-wheelers, Ola Electric has been making strides in producing the **Best Electric Bike** and expanding its product range.

These companies, along with others, will now have a clearer path to dominate India’s EV market, especially as they compete in the **Top Electric Cars Price** and [**Top Electric Vehicles Brands**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/electric-car-showdown-which-is-the-best-under-rs-40-lakh/) categories.

# The Influence of Chinese Technology in the EV Sector

China has long been a global leader in electric vehicle technology, particularly in the development of batteries, charging infrastructure, and electric drivetrains. Chinese companies such as [**BYD**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/byd-and-uber-team-up-for-worlds-largest-electric-cars-fleet/), [**NIO**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/chinese-ev-nio-aims-to-enter-us-market-with-electric-cars-by-2025/), and [**Xpeng**](https://www.xpeng.com/) have made significant advancements in these areas, setting the pace for global EV innovation. However, with the recent directive to halt investments in India, these advancements may no longer directly influence India’s EV market.

The absence of Chinese investments could slow down the adoption of new technologies, such as faster charging solutions and more efficient batteries, both of which are crucial for improving [**Top Electric Vehicles reviews**](https://www.edmunds.com/electric-car/) and **Top Electric cars reviews** in India. On the other hand, it could push Indian companies to invest more heavily in their own research and development, fostering innovation from within the country.

# Battery Production and Supply Chain Challenges

One of the most significant aspects of EV production is battery manufacturing, and China dominates this sector globally. With China discouraging its automakers from investing in India, the Indian EV market could face challenges in sourcing affordable, high-quality batteries. This could drive up costs, potentially impacting [**Best Electric Vehicles Price**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/how-affordable-electric-vehicles-can-help-you-beat-high-gas-prices/) and making electric cars less affordable for consumers in India.

To mitigate this, India may need to seek alternative suppliers from countries like South Korea, Japan, and the United States, which are also leaders in battery technology. Expanding domestic battery production could also be a long-term solution, though it would require significant investments and time to scale.

# The Future of Electric Vehicle Infrastructure in India

Another area where Chinese companies have played a significant role is in the development of EV charging infrastructure. Without their investments, India may struggle to build the necessary infrastructure to support widespread EV adoption. [**Best Electric cars Charging Blog 2024**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/) posts frequently discuss the importance of fast-charging networks, and while India has made progress, there is still a long way to go.

With China out of the picture, Indian companies will need to focus on expanding the charging infrastructure. This is a critical component of the EV ecosystem, as consumers are more likely to adopt electric vehicles if they know that charging stations are readily available. To achieve this, partnerships with international companies and government support will be key to ensuring that [**India’s EV infrastructure**](https://e-amrit.niti.gov.in/infrastructure) can meet the growing demand.

# Potential Opportunities for Other Global Players

China’s withdrawal from the Indian EV market could create opportunities for other global players to step in. Automakers from the United States, Europe, and Japan could find India a more attractive market without the competition from Chinese companies. This shift could lead to new collaborations, technologies, and innovations entering the Indian market.

Companies like Tesla, which has been eyeing the Indian market for years, may now have a better chance of establishing a foothold in the country. The **Top Electric Vehicles News** frequently discusses Tesla’s potential entry into India, and with Chinese competitors stepping back, the timing may be right for Tesla to make its move. Similarly, European automakers like Volkswagen, BMW, and Renault could see this as an opportunity to increase their presence in India’s EV market.

# The Role of Government Policy in Shaping the Future

Government policy will play a crucial role in determining how the Indian EV market evolves in the absence of Chinese investments. India’s government has already implemented several initiatives to boost the production and adoption of electric vehicles, including the [**Faster Adoption and Manufacturing**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1942506) of Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme and tax incentives for EV buyers.

To ensure that the market continues to grow, the government may need to offer additional incentives to attract foreign investments from non-Chinese companies. This could involve easing regulatory hurdles, offering subsidies for battery production, and investing in EV infrastructure. By doing so, India could maintain its momentum in becoming a global leader in electric mobility, even without Chinese support.

# How Will This Affect Consumers?

For consumers, China’s decision to restrict EV investments in India could have both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, without Chinese competition, Indian and non-Chinese manufacturers may increase their market share, leading to more choices in **Top Electric Vehicles** and **Top Electric Cars Brands**. This could result in better products and competitive prices as companies vie for dominance.

On the other hand, the lack of access to Chinese technology and affordable components, particularly batteries, could drive up the **Top Electric Cars Price**, making EVs less affordable for the average consumer. In the long run, this may slow down the mass adoption of electric vehicles in India.

# EV Reviews and Consumer Opinions

As the market evolves, consumer opinions on **Top Electric Vehicles reviews** and **Top Electric cars reviews** will be crucial in shaping future trends. Manufacturers will need to focus on delivering high-quality, reliable electric vehicles at affordable prices if they hope to capture the attention of the Indian consumer base.

# Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for India’s EV Market

China’s decision to halt EV investments in India is a significant development with far-reaching consequences for the electric vehicle industry. While this move may pose challenges in the short term, particularly in terms of technology transfer and battery supply, it also presents opportunities for Indian companies and other global players to step up and fill the gap.

India’s electric vehicle market is still on a growth trajectory, with or without Chinese investment. The future of the **Best Electric Vehicles Brands** and [**Best Electric Vehicles Blogs**](https://electricvehicletoday.com/) will depend on how well Indian companies adapt to this new landscape, how quickly infrastructure can be developed, and how government policies can support this transition.",2024-09-16 13:15:01,43.0,23.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fi4bzl/good_news_for_ola_and_other_indian_evs/,IndianStockMarket

post,1hne63s,"I need advice as I am 27 years, able to save 50K to 70K after all my expenses, I wish to expand my portfolio, ",Notlord97,"Hello everyone, I am planning to expand my portfolio from 70K ( investment amount) to somewhat around 5 to 10L in 2 years, 

My risk appetite is going to be risky so I'm ready to put my 60% in stocks I can bet and the rest 40% for the long term safe play 

I am looking for stocks like, 

1) Tata Steel - Due to increasing infra in our country and improvements across the country for better infra, tata can be a major player  
  
2) Jio finance - RBI is cutting points and I believe Jio can benefit along with that by converting current petrol pumps to Jio which can be a good sign I guess?   
  
3) NTPC and NTPC green - They are venturing into nuclear power and due to recent developments would seem to switching to nuclear power soon 

4) Equitas small finance bank - Not any particular reason but the growth has impressed me 

5) IDFC first bank 

any suggestion would be appreciated as well, 

Here is the snapshot of my portfolio

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

My question is this: 

A Tatamotors CE/PE  is about option to buy or sell Tatamotors (in lots) at that strike price at expiry ITM, that is easily understandable.

Yes, stock options are settled physically. You need to give or take delivery 

But what does Banknifty CE/PE do on expiry ITM? NIFTY BANK is an index, so you can't buy/sell the index itself.  What happens to ITM on expiry?

post,1gpjh7g,Swiggy IPO in a Falling Market: Worth Investing or Not? 🧐📉,Far_Day_7591,"Hey everyone! 👋

With the recent launch of Swiggy’s IPO, there’s a lot of buzz around one of India’s biggest food delivery giants going public. But with the current market downturn (Sensex and Nifty both taking a hit), it’s hard not to wonder – is now really the right time to invest in this IPO? 📉

Swiggy recently cut its IPO valuation target, reportedly aiming for a lower range due to market conditions. While this may make the entry price more attractive, the broader market trends are making a lot of us cautious. The company has strong brand recognition and a growing market in India, but it’s also been under pressure to turn profitable in a highly competitive space.

Curious to hear your thoughts:

1. **Do you think Swiggy’s valuation and growth potential are strong enough to withstand the current market volatility?**
2. **What sectors or factors are you prioritizing in this falling market?**
3. **If you’re investing in this IPO, what’s your strategy? Long-term hold, or are you waiting for a market rebound?**

Let’s get a solid discussion going to help everyone make an informed decision!",2024-11-12 12:22:39,2.0,5.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gpjh7g/swiggy_ipo_in_a_falling_market_worth_investing_or/,IndianStockMarket

It will open you eyes that how research is being done and what company says in annual report it's funny and interesting sometime.

This will take you to path for understanding each business and different parameters uses to judge them.

Here is something I use as analyst each sector.

For Bank & NBFC

NII ,NPA GNPA

Telecom 

ARPU ,OPM

Some general parameters are like OPM, cash flow,sales growth, PEG .

I hope this will get you started don't buy course from Fin Influencer because they are full of shit.

Remember each sector is different you can't use same parameters to compare them.

comment,1gmdtdv,,,,,,,lw66byb,Fine_Effect2649,"No one is too late to invest. The investment train leaves the platform every 1 hr. if you miss one just wait for the next.

To begin with I will suggest that you stick to large cap/blue chip investing. Invest money every month in a set of 3-4 bluechip stocks that has potential to grow and can also hold its value in a down turn. Examples will be ICICI Bank, M&M, Shriram Finance, Cipla etc. Do your own research.

If you want to invest in small caps or themes like manufacturing, Infra, defence etc. do so through ETFs. Its a low cost low risk way to earn if the theme does well...

Two books I suggest you read are

1. The Dhandho Investor: The Low-Risk Value Method to High Returns by Mohnish Pabrai 

2. What I Learned About Investing from Darwin by Pulak Prasad

post,1fmnmea,Looking for suggestions to trim my portfolio,shankeybalwani,"I've holdings in 46 stocks I've been investing since 2019 and as I've learnt more during the last 5~ odd years, I understand having a long list of companies with little invested amounts doesn't make sense and want to trim the number of companies under 30.

I'm looking to do so by comparing a combination of ratios, but that's still so confusing and time consuming considering each industry has its own benchmark/ historical average.

Is there a free tool/ website that can help in comparison and ease my decision making?

I have been investing for a couple of months now, and I mostly tried to invest in fundamentally strong companies which are fairly valued (except Suzlon lol). 

Needed a review and some suggestion for the road ahead. I plan to hold most of these for long term, and I'm trying to accumulate them whenever the market dips. 

Apart from that I have cash on my hands right now to put in the market and I wanted to ask suggestions about some of the stocks on my watchlist:

* **Defence Stocks**: **HAL,Mazdock and BEL**. They have been projected to do well in the long term but they seem to be extremely overvalued , and have been correcting every now and then these last few weeks. Their quarterly results have been excellent and have been in the news frequently but their momentum right now is confusing and I don't know when to enter
* **Canara Bank and NMDC**: I found them through a custom screener. They appear to have strong financial strength and are undervalued. Canara Bank shows up in so many 'gowth' screeners and NMDC has been a consistent performer (and also government backed). Yet, they've been falling rapidly the last couple of months. I don't know what's wrong with them. I do plan on having them in my portfolio, but again, confused about entering.
* **Cipla:** The pharmaceutical industry has been a great, consistent performer as far as the stock market is concerned, and I plan to have exposure to it though Cipla, as it has great financials and a good valuation (good ROCE and divided yield as well)
* **SBI and ICICI bank:** Held them purely due to some analyst (STRONG BUY) reccomendations, exited them at a minor profit. Don't really know how to analyse bank stocks but they seem to be 'essentials' .

Now, I have some doubts regarding my portfolio:

1. **Is my MF portfolio good?**

I started with 5 SIPs based on my research but kept adding more whenever I found something interesting. Recently, friends advised that having too many MF SIPs can be problematic. They mentioned that the investment amount shouldn't change, but the number of MFs should be fewer. I didn't fully understand this. Are they right? If so, why? Also, if I need to reduce the number of MFs, which SIPs should I keep and which should I let go?

2. **Should I invest less in SIPs and more in stocks?**

I'm 29, and my friends say my risk appetite is higher. However, I prefer long-term investments and don't have the time or expertise to buy/sell stocks regularly. Am I making a mistake by focusing more on SIPs? Should I allocate more to stocks?

3. **Should I consider an SWP?**

4. I have 10 lacs to invest now. Any suggestions on how to allocate this based on my current portfolio?

Sorry for the many questions, but I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!",2024-06-27 05:22:34,3.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1dpjl0b/seeking_advice_on_my_investment_portfolio/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1dpjl0b,,,,,,,lahef35,Individual_Zombie_85,"1. Yeah I think you have way too many MF's. You can reduce it to 4-5 funds max. Please check the overlap between the different funds. I don't think multiple ELSS Tax Saver funds are required. Just keep 1 from each category. The reason for not keeping multiple MF's is, different expense ratios can keep eating into your profits.
2. If you don't have time to analyse and buy/sell stocks, you can continue with your SIP, no problem in that. You mentioned that you are picking stocks based on your friend's suggestions, and that can go horribly wrong. It's your life and your financial goals, so you can take the call about which way you want to go.

comment,1idn8ni,,,,,,,ma0cc49,Embarrassed-Row4192,"Tata Motors, Motilal Oswal, and Jio Financial are all strong companies with good long-term potential.

1.	Tata Motors – Growing in electric vehicles (EVs), commercial vehicles, and Jaguar Land Rover. Reducing debt is a big plus. Value unlocking will happen with PV & CV split in near future. 

2.	Motilal Oswal – A strong financial company with a good brokerage business, asset management, and housing finance. Currently available at lower than intrinsic value. 

3.	Jio Financial – New but has huge potential with Reliance backing. Expanding into lending, insurance, and digital finance. Only overvalued company on your list. You can average out tamo & motilal and wait for PE of jio fin to come down further and then bring the cost down or swap for better businesses. 

If you believe in them for the long term, buying more when prices dip (averaging down) can help lower your average cost.

NTPC has growth visibility for another 2-3 years, so I put it on rank 1. I might add more if the correction is steep. 

TaMo is facing competitive intensity, but has done well so far, and has a good launch pipeline. The industry is struggling, so stay vigilant, and monitor sales, discounting, inventory levels, and competition. I'll put it on rank 2. Don't plan to add, and have gradually reduced my exposure by half in the last few months. 

Zomato has growth, but for every unit of growth, it has 10 units of hype. And valuations are retarded. We're all riding this story on narratives. Rank 3.

Secondly, you have got some good stock picks there, but try to pick stocks based on your own knowledge and analysis. Don't pay attention to social media hype or tips and recommendations. And as the amount is small dont over diversify stocks, selling those 1 quantity stocks will result in charges and brokerges fees more.

Last but not least, i think you are quiet young, dont invest anymore in individual stock picks now m start a mutual fund instead, like a  Index fund. Keep investing there and, side by side, study how the stock market works more thoroughly.

comment,1hx88fw,,,,,,,m6721pn,SuperbPercentage8050,"Absolutely. It will go beyond 20% if you will stick and invest in such companies.

VBL is amazing but the multiples you have paid, forget returns for 5 years. You can already see it in  Dmart asian paints. Long term is great but 3-5 years at such expensive multiples I doubt any meaningful return of more than 10% on VBL.

Idea is not a 7-10rs stock but a mid and large cap stock. its a wealth destroyer and even ifs the debt gets restructured then business is loosing subscribers on a daily basis and 5-10-20 years down the line I dont know the exact time frame but it will be delisted from the markets.

UNION BANK ? in banking you look beyond PE. its a leveraged business and will you really open a bank account in union bank ? if the answer is no then why on earth you are buying its stock. its a bad investment and a bad bank.

tata motors view I have already written in detail you can take a look into that on indiagrowthstocks

JIO financials the business model is good but its a large cap company and you paying crazy money upfront at 120 pe which means growth of 20-30% for next few years is already factored in the stock.

you can screen the other stocks on your own using the checklist.",2025-01-09 08:27:06,1.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hx88fw/am_i_cooked/,StockMarketIndia

The falling knife thing does not apply to tata motors because the PE hasnt changed much the management is good and the ev space will see growth eventually its not a small or mid cap so its chill.
Beyond that market as a whole is red overall. 
tata motors are going through a demerger i think the date is next year December so the stock is likely to consolidate or fall due to demerger pains and then we will see what happens depending on if auto sector recovers and/or nirmala tai gets her shit together. So your one year plan may not work, if you dont like that idea you should sell and cut losses or stay and be patient.

post,1fojl6t,TataMotorDVR x TataMotors conversion Mismatch,ChananaKK,"I held 359 shares of Tatamotordvr and 81 shares of tatamotors before DVR was discontinued to be listed. 

As per the announcement, we were supposed to get 7 tatamotors shares for every 10 tatamotordvr shares held and rest would be settled with cash. 

However, today when my Zerodha got updated with quantity allocated, I can see a total of 324 shares under tatamotors which I think should be 326 shares (I rounded off the 359 shares to 350 and 9 coming back to me in cash, which makes it
7*35 =245 PLUS 81 Tatamotors shares = 326 tatamotors shares total). 

However as per their logic, they have converted only 243 shares (compared to 245 calculated above) whose maths doesn't add up.

Since the shares you have been allotted are considered as dividends, the company has sold a portion of your allotment to cover the TDS, and the remaining net quantity of shares is credited to your account.
