post,1evyo7m,TCS vs Dmart vs HAL vs VBL,GoldenDew9,"Hey guys, Finally done my visual screener !! And I just analyzed 4 pop giants and here is what i just found out from simple scan of QoQ result.

The Trend is Immensely helpful over the numbers. Beacuse using tht you can discriminate the ***nature of business of the stock***.  

* **TCS** - Consistent business without much of seasonality or cyclicality
* **Dmart** - Consistent business with some seasonality. Has to run its business at very low margin
* **HAL** - Much of seasonality & and may be little cyclicality in business. JFM Quarter is good !
* **VBL** -   Much of seasonality in business. AMJ Quarter is good !

post,1k6oshx,"India’s AI Push: What it could mean for top IT companies like Infosys, TCS & Wipro",Opto_themes,"India has historically trailed the US and China when it comes to AI investment — just $21.8bn over the past decade compared to $455bn in the US and $92.7bn in China. But the government’s new $1.2bn IndiaAI strategy suggests that's starting to change, with the plan including building a domestic LLM and making 10,000 GPUs available to startups and researchers.

We've explored some of the top IT companies: Infosys is working on 400+ AI projects, TCS just crossed $30bn in annual revenue, partly thanks to AI-led deals. Wipro says AI is now central to almost every client conversation, and it's locked in over $5bn in large deals this year.

post,1e4uuaw,"Investing in Largecaps like Reliance, Infosys, Wipro, TCS, ITC will not give you multibagger returns ever. You need to start investing in Smallcap, Microcaps, and a good midcap to get multibaggers and make a multibagger portfolio.",Personal_Common_4437,"Investing in large-cap companies like Reliance, Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and ITC may not yield multibagger returns. For significant gains, consider small-cap, micro-cap, and select mid-cap stocks. Let’s explore why and how these investments can be more rewarding.

How Does a Stock Become a Multibagger?
Low Price and Low Market Capitalization (Mcap):
A stock is low-priced when it has a low Mcap, often due to existing negatives or concerns in the market.
Market participants tend to overlook these stocks because of these perceived negatives, keeping their prices low.
The Investment Strategy
Identifying Potential Multibaggers:

As investors seeking multibagger returns, our goal is to identify and invest in stocks that the market is not currently favoring.
Once the negative aspects are resolved, the stock’s value can significantly increase.
Example:

Consider a small-cap stock in the pharmaceutical sector, such as Laurus Labs. Initially, it may have faced issues with regulatory approvals, keeping its price low. Once these hurdles were overcome, the stock saw substantial growth, becoming a multibagger.
The Common Misconception
Expecting Perfect Fundamentals at Low Prices:

It is unrealistic to find a stock priced at 20 with perfect fundamentals. Such stocks will naturally have some negatives.
Large-cap stocks with a Mcap of 10,000 crores or more have often already delivered significant returns. Expecting them to become multibaggers from this point is impractical.
Example:

Infosys, a leading IT company, has a high Mcap and has already provided substantial returns over the years. Expecting it to continue delivering multibagger returns is unrealistic.
The Potential of Smaller Mcap Stocks
Smaller Mcap Stocks Have Higher Growth Potential:

Stocks with a Mcap of 200 crores can grow to 2,000 crores, providing a tenfold return.
Similarly, a stock with a Mcap of 500 crores can grow to 5,000 crores, offering significant returns.
Example:

Consider a company like Avanti Feeds, which had a lower Mcap but expanded its business significantly, leading to multibagger returns.
Understanding Market Saturation
Saturation Point and Valuation:

After a certain Mcap, a stock’s growth potential diminishes, making it harder to achieve multibagger status.
Stocks with Mcaps above 10,000 crores require extraordinary growth to become multibaggers, which is challenging.
Example:

Tata Motors, with a high Mcap, would need exceptional growth in sales and profitability to double or triple its value, which is less likely compared to smaller companies.
Simple Rules for Stock Market Success
Buy Less Discussed Stocks:

Investing in under-the-radar stocks can yield high returns as they are often undervalued.
Buy Underowned Stocks:

Stocks with low institutional ownership may have greater growth potential once discovered.
Look for Multibagger Prospects:

Focus on companies with the potential for significant growth rather than those that have already delivered high returns.
Avoid Stocks That Are Already Multibaggers:

Stocks that have already provided substantial returns may have limited future growth.
Consider Mcap:

Always evaluate the Mcap to understand the potential for future growth. Stocks with lower Mcaps generally have higher growth potential.
By following these guidelines and focusing on small-cap, micro-cap, and promising mid-cap stocks, investors can build a portfolio with the potential for multibagger returns. Remember, the key lies in identifying undervalued opportunities and being patient as these stocks realize their growth potential.",2024-07-16 17:40:44,4.0,26.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1e4uuaw/investing_in_largecaps_like_reliance_infosys/,IndianStockMarket

comment,1e4uuaw,,,,,,,ldhqodk,Possible-Bite-2826,"This is not  right approach of  multibagger ,it difeers with time range and money contributed

If u think investing 1lakh in a stock and providing 10 to 15lakh return is only multi agger is wrong assumption

Power of compounding is more rewarding that multi bagger

Large cap have compounding effect 
Small cap has multibagger effect 

Large cap when compounding for long time became multi bagger but small cap and medium cap became multi bagger if ROCE is not there like large cap compounding doesn't work

3rd one is buying in market dips 


Tata motors was 70 rupees in 2020 now 1000 10x
Many large cap gave such return but not many small cap gave such returns during 2020 because of sting fundamental to overcome covid.. same in 2008, and 2000 crashes


If market is high and u want high return in large cap ur investment should be higher like 5 lakh to 10 lakh so you would get best and solid return like 2x or 2.5 x return return so 
10lakh becomes 25 lakh in 3 years but I won't invest 10lakh in one small cap thinking it will become 1 crore

I would put in high investment in apple and oranges and not in unknown fruit believing it becomes next apple and oranges

Long-term satisfaction is better than shorterm happiness in stock market.

You plan to make 1rupee to  10 rupee , I plan 10 rupee into 30 rupee .. urs is 10x mine is 2x but I earn 10rupees more than you . You search 100 company to put 1 rupee , I search 10 company to pute 10 rupees ..

On February 28, 2025, the Indian stock market experienced a significant downturn, with the Nifty IT index plummeting over 4%. This decline was led by major IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which reached a 52-week low, and Tech Mahindra (TechM), which fell by approximately 6%. Persistent Systems also faced substantial losses, with its stock dropping around 6%. This sell-off was largely influenced by global market trends, particularly the disappointing earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia, which triggered a ripple effect across international markets, including India.

The broader market sentiment was also negative, with the Sensex falling over 1,000 points and the Nifty dropping below the 22,300 mark. This broad-based sell-off affected multiple sectors, including auto, metals, and banking. Factors contributing to the decline include global economic uncertainty, profit booking across markets, and the impact of Nvidia's earnings report. Despite these challenges, the IT sector remains a crucial component of India's economy, though ongoing global uncertainties pose significant risks.",2025-02-28 08:49:46,3.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1j03cqb/nifty_it_crashes_4_tcs_hits_52week_low_techm/,IndianStockMarket

If you invest on your own till 7 lac no TCS per financial year. So you can allocate on your own through your own account and family account or just invest 7 this year and after march you can invest more to save on TCS. 

I have been investing in US/ europe/ china/ Taiwan and i use that same strategy of having my own account and my family accounts. To avoid TCS and reduce tax liability on my returns. 

Etf is not the best way to invest globally because the underlining assets are traded on a daily basis and huge transaction cost happens which is not reflected by ETF.( read terry smith investing for growth and he has dedicated 2 chapters on etf and how these managers burn our money and on face of it you will see that the fee is low but transaction fees are hidden and not shown) that erodes 2-3% of your capital yearly just as transaction fees and if you compound that for 10 years its around 50% of your money which you could have made by just buying directly  and performing better than etf.",2024-11-15 09:29:57,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1grsbkq/tax_collected_at_source_tcs_on_foreign_remittances/,IndianStockMarket

post,1e1bl3b,Never sell you winners.,lotus_eater_rat,"I moved to Pune in 2018 and lived near the Persistent System office. I used to pass through their building, and It may sound funny but one of the reasons to check the company was because I liked their office names. I started investing in the PPFAS mutual fund and the persistent system was one of the top holdings. I bought shares worth 45K in 2018. Sold 1/3rd in 2021 and again in 2022 to get advantage of 1 lakh LTCG tax-expectation. Also bought TATA elixir during the same period and sold it when it became 2X.

I did make some money but after seeing the further growth I promised myself that I would never sell  
unless there is something seriously wrong with the companies I am holding. Have not sold a single stock since March 2022, Remaining 15k of the persistent system is now 2.60 lakhs (17X) in 6 years. I have HDFC Bank, ITC, Persistent System, Arman Finance, Maruti, Titan, ICICI Bank, TCS, and NMDC in my portfolio.

I know my XIRR (22%) may not be impressive in today’s scenario but I would suggest don’t sell your  
winner for a small gain. If you are holding good companies, there is potential it could be 25X or 50X in the long term. Also, think what difference it will make to your wealth if u even make 5k in 6 months on a 10k investment. It will surely make a difference if u make 2.5 lakh from 10k.

post,1ejz6db,"Make ₹5, Get ₹0.61 – Thanks, Government! 🙂",ThoughtfulRambler,"Hey everyone,

I'm pretty new to trading and usually invest in large-cap stocks but in small amounts. Recently, I wanted to learn about shorting stocks. For those who don't know, it's when you sell a stock at a high price and then buy it back at a lower price, and your profit is the difference.

So, some days ago, I decided to short 1 share of TCS and ended up making a profit of ₹5. I was excited until I saw the Equity Contract Note from Zerodha the next day. I couldn’t believe the number of charges on such a small profit.

Here’s a breakdown:

* **Pay in/Pay out obligation:** ₹5.00
* **Taxable value of Supply (Brokerage):** ₹(2.58)
* **Exchange transaction charges:** ₹(0.29)
* **Clearing charges:** N/A
* **CGST (@9% of Brok, SEBI, Trans & Clearing Charges):** N/A
* **SGST (@9% of Brok, SEBI, Trans & Clearing Charges):** N/A
* **IGST (@18% of Brok, SEBI, Trans & Clearing Charges):** ₹(0.52)
* **Securities transaction tax:** ₹(1.00)
* **SEBI turnover fees:** ₹(0.01)
* **Stamp duty:** N/A
* **Net amount receivable/(payable by client):** ₹0.61

After all these deductions, I was left with a whopping ₹0.61 from my ₹5 profit 😑 . Let that sink in. The taxes and fees ate up almost everything.

How do people manage to make any real profit with all these charges? It feels really discouraging for someone who's just trying to learn and make a little money.

Any tips for a beginner like me to handle these fees and still come out ahead? Or is this something we all just have to deal with?

Thanks for listening.

post,1ks1l63,Gr0ww Pricing change ↗️,sandy_lilith,"Note: Earlier, you were charged DP charges once per stock (ISIN) per day. While depository charged Gr0ww for every sell transaction, Gr0ww covered those charges for you. With the revised pricing, DP charges for each sell transaction will now be applicable to you. However, DP charged by Gr0ww will be Rs.0 for sell value less than Rs.100.

  
Explanation:

# 💡 Earlier Policy (Old Pricing):

* You were charged **only once per day per stock (ISIN)**.
* **Gr0ww used to bear the DP charges on your behalf**.

# 📌 Example (Old Policy):

You sold:

* 50 shares of **TCS** in the morning
* 50 more shares of **TCS** in the evening

→ **Only one DP charge** was applied for TCS on that day.  
→ **Gr0ww paid this charge for you** (you paid ₹0).

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ⭐⭐⭐📌 Examples (New Policy):

# 🔹 Example 1: Multiple Sells in a Day

You sell:

* 10 shares of **Infosys** worth ₹1,000 at 10:30 AM
* 5 shares of **Infosys** worth ₹500 at 2:00 PM

→ Two separate **sell transactions**  
→ You’ll be charged **DP charges twice**, even though it’s the same stock

post,1imqw8n,"Other than SIPs, NO ONE leaves happy from stock market",According_Bear1543,"If you enter the market in any other mode other than SIPs, you will never gain happiness, infact you will gain tension, frustration and mental torture only.

Lets see one by one

**FNO traders** \- Huge losses, financial troubles, no need to type more

**Intraday traders** \- Same as above

**Normal traders** \- Always in tension, even if in profits, just scraping by. Wont even make more than a TCS 5 year experience guy annually. 

Even if you make more, you are paying 40% tax, so basically you are risking half for the government. Lets take an example, if u have 2 kids, u r risking one kid for you know who.

**Equity investors** \- Most make less than SIP investors. You will see in next 6 months, why stock market profits are a FUGAZI, all COVID portfolios will be back to 10% CAGR (less than SIPs).

Even if you have good profits, you will always ruin your mindset over why u didnt sell at the top, why after u book profit your stock went even more.

Lets say you are one of the lucky ones and catch a stock which is 10X, still you will cry arre yar i invested only 1 lac in Waaree, why i didnt invest 10 lacs.

**MORAL OF THE STORY - You all are ruining your peace of mind for beating inflation, on the other hand you say if your job hits your mindset you will leave the job. So why this double standards with stock market hehe.**",2025-02-11 04:58:21,133.0,39.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1imqw8n/other_than_sips_no_one_leaves_happy_from_stock/,IndianStockMarket

Account Opening: Free.

Account Maintenance: Free.

Brokerage for U.S. stocks: Zero commission on buying and selling U.S. stocks and ETFs​



Currency Conversion (INR to USD): INDmoney typically charges 0.75% of the transaction value (or ₹750, whichever is lower) as a platform fee during currency conversion​

Withdrawal Charges: A fee of $5 applies for withdrawing funds back to your Indian bank account. 

Taxes and Compliance: Tax Collected at Source (TCS) applies at 5% for remittances exceeding ₹7 lakhs in a financial year. (can be reclaimed during ITR Filing)

Capital gains tax applies to profits. 

Dividends from U.S. stocks are taxed at 25% by U.S. authorities, but these can be offset when filing your Indian tax return under the DTAA.",2024-12-05 12:46:16,72.0,61.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1h78df1/us_stock_via_ind_money/,IndianStockMarket

post,1fvog0a,My Long Term Stocks and why.,Not-grey28,"Bharti Airtel @ 1021- I think, eventually Airtel will beat Jio as they have control of the middle-class to upper-middle-class market due to their much better customer service, and the Middle Class of India is growing rapidly. Airtel also did a great job expanding into Africa, so they can repeat the same processes in other regions of Africa and maybe South America.

Tata Power @ 388 - Renewable Energy will have to be the future as AI uses extreme amounts of energy. Tata Power is the best stock to take advantage of this as they continue building more plants around India and partnering with different states to invest in renewable energy. The company also holds the highest number of EV charging stations which I think will be extremely useful in the next decade. The management is also good.

KNR Infra @ 249 - I wanted to invest in the infra sector as that's where the government spending is. KNR has good fundamentals and finishes projects ahead of time, they also have relatively low debt.

Lemon Tree Hotels @ 117 - My newest Investment. All the hotels and reviews of the company are generally positive. (4.5 stars) They provide fairly affordable hotels for upper-midscale, midscale, and economy segments where there is relatively low competition in India. The company also aims to heavily increase its number of rooms & hotels by 2028. I had a good experience visiting two of their hotels. 

  
KPIT Tech @ 1366 - Even though many think it's overvalued, I disagree. It's basically the only Indian company doing heavy R&D on Autonomous vehicles and AI-related automobiles. The company also has expanded into 13 other countries where it can leverage the higher incomes and facilities to develop new patents.

  
TCS @ 3526 - I don't have much invested in this as I only did to investnifty50 companies, I have also put in L&T  and ICICI.

  
I'm a relatively young investor and tried to research as much as possible to invest, these are the summary of my research. I have put in almost 9 lakh combined (not all is my money). I am willing to invest for 15 to 20 years unless anything unordinary happens and don't really have a target price. Any advice would be appreciated.

post,1dwtovh,Companies I have chosen to invest in for long term,Big_Investment28,"Hello everyone! 

So I have picked a few shares for long term investment. And I want you all to have a look and maybe just give your review or opinion as this will be the first time I will be investing in a share. 
I have always heard people say that you should not put all your money in just one sector, you should have a diverse portfolio so I have selected these stocks for each sector.

•**FMCG**- HUL & ITC

•**Tech company**- TCS & Infosys

•**Pharmaceutical**- Lupin & Biocon

•**Finance**- HDFC & SBI, PFC

•**Automobile**- Tata Motors 

•**Metal Mining**- Coal India & Hindustan zinc

•**Infrastructure**- Ambuja cement

•**Defence**- Bharat Electronics.


To select these, I have mainly looked for the company's-

 •**Market cap**(more than 15,000 CR)

•**Debt to equity ratio**(less than 1)

•**Promoter's holding**(more than 50%)

•**Profit, Sales and ROE**(more than 15%)

•**Zero pledge percentage**

No company follows all the above criteria but I choose the one I felt will perform well among its other competitors. 
It would be really helpful if you guys could tell me if I have chosen the right stock, If I should drop a company from the list or add a company. 
I am thinking of buying these soon, I won't buy a lot of quantity as I am new, but still it would be a decent amount so your help would be appreciated. 

Thank you in advance!

comment,1dwtovh,,,,,,,lbxztqo,Magister1995,"Okay sure... 

1. NEVER invest in individual stocks, especially at these valuations. It's insane. Also what if company falls tomorrow, idc how big it is. 

2. Don't buy all in one shot, start a weekly/monthly investment plan. This helps unit cost averaging.

3. Go with roughly this breakdown but slightly adjust based on your risk factor: 70% BROAD market etf or mutual fund. 20% Gov of India debt fund/etf, 10% metal fund/etf.

Ex: MOTILAL OSWAL NIFTY 500 ETF. Buys top 500 biggest companies but also includes mid and small cap companies. 

Why?
Because we don't time the market, it's always a losing bet, especially for long term investing. That's why start SIP regardless of where market is. If it goes down you buy more. Take profits in what the INDEX gives hence you're buying NIFTY 500 or NIFTY 250 broad market fund so you buy little of all companies. Debt fund helps hedge against stock market uncertainty/depression and so does gold fund.

Consistently, top university research has shown broad market instruments like ETF, MF that follow index REGULARLY beat fund managers or individual stocks. Long time in market, and buying close to the WHOLE market will keep your money growing. Don't be an idiot that tries to 10x money overnight.

In India, there are only 3 companies over $100 billion - RIL with $200 billion at the top followed by TCS and HDFC.

Either of the two things can be true:

1. The US market is blown out of proportion
2. Indian market has not scaled as much as the US market after Covid

I mean the difference between the marketcap is just ginormous. It's trillions of dollars. I mean NIFTY500 marketcap is pretty much the marketcap of one company - Apple. Crazy when you think about it.

No more passive learning—this forces you to apply real analysis, make decisions, and improve over time. You will also be able to track performance over time.

post,1h4zocs,Have two questions in context of Motilal Oswal S & P index fund investment.,nickchangs,"Hi,



Have two questions in context of Motilal Oswal S & P index fund investment.



\> I put X money in Motilal Oswal liquid fund to start STP into S&P fund. When I did this, I was not aware that STP is not allowed via liquid fund into the S&P fund. I came to know about the addendum after a few days when I wanted to start the STP. Should I do a daily SWP (I don’t know if this is possible) from the liquid fund into my personal account and from there start daily SIP into the S&P fund. The liquid fund will generate more return than  savings bank interest. Or, should I just withdraw one shot and start daily SIP?



\> I had a conversation with Motilal Oswal representative and he informed me that more than 7 lakh investment in S&P fund in a financial year will attract 20% TCS. Is this true?

post,1ebrm29,Are foreign investments comparatively favorable following the Budget announcement?,avitricks,"Under the LRS (Liberalised Remittance Scheme), the foreign asset purchase above 7 Lakhs are subject to TCS (Tax collected at source) which was increased from 5% to 20% in the 2023 Union Budget.

There was no mechanism provided to offset this TCS against the tax deducted at source. Eventually, taxpayers had to claim for the TCS as a separate refund during the ITR.

This year, one of the amendments in the latest Budget is allowing employers to adjust the TCS against the TDS. Employees can now declare their TCS to the employer, allowing the tax adjustment accordingly.

Does it make the investment in foreign funds (Mutual funds or Direct Equity) little bit attractive now, since after the adjustment the in-hand monthly salary would be increased as they don't have to wait till the end of the financial year?",2024-07-25 10:34:55,3.0,3.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/1ebrm29/are_foreign_investments_comparatively_favorable/,IndiaInvestments

post,1j03bqc,"Nifty IT Crashes 4%: TCS Hits 52-Week Low, TechM Sinks 6% – What’s Behind the Sell-Off?",ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/0s01nq48fule1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b70295bb3522d1529a8b8f1de77cb7f308398844

On February 28, 2025, the Indian stock market experienced a significant downturn, with the Nifty IT index plummeting over 4%. This decline was led by major IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which reached a 52-week low, and Tech Mahindra (TechM), which fell by approximately 6%. Persistent Systems also faced substantial losses, with its stock dropping around 6%. This sell-off was largely influenced by global market trends, particularly the disappointing earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia, which triggered a ripple effect across international markets, including India.

The broader market sentiment was also negative, with the Sensex falling over 1,000 points and the Nifty dropping below the 22,300 mark. This broad-based sell-off affected multiple sectors, including auto, metals, and banking. Factors contributing to the decline include global economic uncertainty, profit booking across markets, and the impact of Nvidia's earnings report. Despite these challenges, the IT sector remains a crucial component of India's economy, though ongoing global uncertainties pose significant risks.",2025-02-28 08:47:44,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1j03bqc/nifty_it_crashes_4_tcs_hits_52week_low_techm/,StockMarketIndia

post,1kf3vfl,Where to invest 20k for 10 years long-term??,Clear_Bill_,"Lately, I’ve been overthinking things like revenue, profit, OPM, and PE ratios — it’s getting a bit confusing.
I already hold stocks like TCS, ICICI Bank, ITC, Dr. Reddy’s, Hero MotoCorp, and Tata Motors — most are at all-time highs.
Now I’m wondering: which ones should I average, and is it a good idea to start something new like Muthoot Finance , Polycab ?

post,1jyjczn,Just open-sourced a financial LLM trained on 10 years of Indian stock data — outputs SQL you can run on Db,Cod_277killsshipment,"Hey folks,

Wanted to share something I’ve been building over the past few weeks — a small open-source project that’s been a grind to get right.

I fine-tuned a transformer model (TinyLLaMA-1.1B) on structured Indian stock market data — fundamentals, OHLCV, and index data — across 10+ years. The model outputs SQL queries in response to natural language questions like:

- “What was the net_profit of INFY on 2021-03-31?”
- “What’s the 30-day moving average of TCS close price on 2023-02-01?”
- “Show me YoY growth of EPS for RELIANCE.”

It’s 100% offline — no APIs, no cloud calls — and ships with a DuckDB file preloaded with the dataset. You can paste the model’s SQL output into DuckDB and get results instantly. You can even add your own data without changing the schema.

Built this as a proof of concept for how useful small LLMs can be if you ground them in actual structured datasets.

It’s live on Hugging Face here:  
**https://huggingface.co/StudentOne/Nifty50GPT-Final**

Would love feedback if you try it out or have ideas to extend it. Cheers.",2025-04-13 22:05:15,13.0,3.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1jyjczn/just_opensourced_a_financial_llm_trained_on_10/,StockMarketIndia

post,1it0q4p,Today Interesting Concept to learn - *Dupont Analysis*🙇🏻,Piyush4758,"



Before understanding a Dupont Analysis 
we have to understand few concepts - 

1) Return on Equity :-
 📍 You and your friend startsmomos business
📍Both of you invested 1000 each to buy flour, veggies, all etc.
📍At the end of the day youmade ""Net Profit of ₹ 700

ROE =700/1000 = 70% 
This is how much profits you made for every ₹ Invested 

ROE - (Practical Example of TCSin crore)
📍Net Profit of TCS for FY2023 =42,303
📍Shareholder's(Equity sharecapitalfund as
+ Reserve) = 90,442
📍ROE = NP/ SHF = 42303/90442 = 46.77% it means that for every ₹ of shareholders money TCS has generated 46 paisa.

2) Return on asset :-
📍You have expanded the mamosbusiness and bought a cart, intensilsetc.
📍Now you have total Assets of 1500
📍Your Net profit is 800
📍Returnon Asset = 800/1500 = 53.3% it means that 
How much you are earning on each ₹ Invested. 

Practical -Return on Asset of TCS
📍Net Profit of TCS for FY2023 = 42303
📍Total Asset for TCS as on Mar'23= 142859
📍 Return on Asset = NetProfit/Total Asset
=42303/142859 = 29.6% it means  that TCS is earning 29 paisa on eachRupee invested in business.

3) MOAT :-
Most is the advantage of businessthrough which its earning above normal
📍Pricing Power - is a MOAT (Cigarette)
📍Operating Efficiency - is a MOAT ( DMART )
📍 Legacy of Business - is a MOAT (Tata)

4) What does deport Analysis do?
📍It breaks down ROE & ROAso one can understand thereason why ROE/ROA is increasingor decreasing.
📍Dupont Analysis is crucial tounderstand moat of any business.

post,1h11xhy,Nifty IT is making new high. Let's get an insight from Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) ,ZestycloseJudgment89,"**Leading Quadrant:** Currently, there are no stocks positioned in the leading quadrant.

**Improving Quadrant:** LTIMindtree (LTIM) and LTTS are gaining strength and have the potential to move into the leading quadrant soon. However, Infosys (INFY) appears to be losing momentum, which may delay its transition to the leading quadrant.

**Weakening Quadrant:** Coforge is in the weakening quadrant, but its rising relative momentum could propel it into the leading quadrant. Similarly, Persistent Systems has been gaining relative momentum recently. On the other hand, Wipro and TCS are showing signs of losing momentum, although both are still maintaining positions above key benchmarks.

**Lagging Quadrant:** Mphasis, currently in the lagging quadrant, is demonstrating strong momentum and may soon transition to the improving quadrant. Tech Mahindra (Tech M) some uptick in momentum but can underperform the benchmark in the near-term.  HCL Tech is underperforming the benchmark and it losing momentum Within IT basket, HCL Tech remains the weakest stock in terms of momentum and relative strength.

post,1hi1f1h,Sectoral MF vs Individual stocks ,EmployeeSuspicious87,"Hey folks,

As many say,

What’s the issue in holding sectoral ETF/MF and also direct stocks?

Example: I heavily invest in ITBees and also have high amount of shares in TCS, Infy, HCL, Wipro, so what’s the issue? 

I see peoples say if you are buying all IT stocks, rather invest in ITBees itself? I personally don’t get it!

Although I invest in ITBees (for safer reasons), I know all the 4 individual stocks are of high quality - why can’t i invest in them for stock price appreciation + (dividends/bonus/split), remember Wipro just gave 1:1 Bonus, these are just icing on the cake to get such benefits and multiply your wealth in the longer run (ETF/Index funds don’t give them rather it’s a safer bet thingy as mentioned above)

Same goes for Pharmabees + (I invest in DrReddy and Natcopharma)

and 

BankBees + (I invest in HDFC, SouthIndian, IDFC, Planning to start IndusInd as well)

post,1h79xta,Taxation on ETF in India for Sectoral indexes,EmployeeSuspicious87,"Hey Investors,

I have heavily invested in Niftybees, ITBees, BankBees and Pharmabees. Today when I was checking the analytics section in my stock broker (Zerodha), all these ETF's are categorized as ""Debt"". Should I be worried about it?

I know individual stocks like HDFCBank, INFY, TCS etc... are all taxed at 12.5% (LTCG). Is the same applies for NiftyBees, ITBees and Pharmabees as well?

Also, why does NSE official website show Niftybees, Bankbees under Debt category? [https://www.nseindia.com/products-services/etfs-debt](https://www.nseindia.com/products-services/etfs-debt)

T stocks are in demand today as the Nifty IT index hit a record high, driven by optimistic growth projections for the sector, with HSBC forecasting a 6-7% growth in FY26.

**Let's analyze the sector using RRG.**

Leading Quadrant: LTIM, Wipro, Persistent Systems, and Mphasis are in the leading quadrant. However, LTIM and Mphasis both are losing strength and are moving towards the weakening quadrant.

Weakening Quadrant: Coforge and TCS are in the weakening quadrant, with TCS appearing weaker than Coforge.

Lagging Quadrant: LTTS, HCL Tech, and Tech Mahindra are in the lagging quadrant. Among them, HCL Tech is gaining strength and moving toward the improving quadrant.

Improving Quadrant: Infosys has just entered the improving quadrant and could regain strength moving forward.",2024-12-12 08:02:20,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hcgbp7/why_are_it_stocks_in_demand_today_as_nifty_it/,StockMarketIndia

post,1j03dew,"Nifty IT Crashes 4%: TCS Hits 52-Week Low, TechM Sinks 6% – What’s Behind the Sell-Off?",ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/kuuchxhyfule1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3231aff0a768f8a66742812a530273d3cabfc7c

On February 28, 2025, the Indian stock market experienced a significant downturn, with the Nifty IT index plummeting over 4%. This decline was led by major IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which reached a 52-week low, and Tech Mahindra (TechM), which fell by approximately 6%. Persistent Systems also faced substantial losses, with its stock dropping around 6%. This sell-off was largely influenced by global market trends, particularly the disappointing earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia, which triggered a ripple effect across international markets, including India.

The broader market sentiment was also negative, with the Sensex falling over 1,000 points and the Nifty dropping below the 22,300 mark. This broad-based sell-off affected multiple sectors, including auto, metals, and banking. Factors contributing to the decline include global economic uncertainty, profit booking across markets, and the impact of Nvidia's earnings report. Despite these challenges, the IT sector remains a crucial component of India's economy, though ongoing global uncertainties pose significant risks.",2025-02-28 08:51:16,3.0,3.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1j03dew/nifty_it_crashes_4_tcs_hits_52week_low_techm/,IndianStreetBets

I want to then re invest that 25% into tesla, guess what. I pay again 20% TCS to the RBI, on the returned 25$.




So the RBI has a continuous stream of incoming dollars from me, without taking any risks.


When I sell tesla after 10 years, the RBI again makes 15 to 21% as taxes on the gains.  

The RBI never gets any loss either, you can't carry forward losses in your investment in Tesla.



The Gaslighting:


The way the system is set up: 


I have 1Lakh Rupees, I want to buy Tesla stock, I will get dollars of 79000 only to buy Tesla.  ( TCS charges).



However, 

The entire 1Lakh was converted into dollars, the 20% dollars were taken away by the RBI.


Read it again.



The RBI tells you that TCS will returned back to you in INR terms, ie 20% of the INR amount you wanted to be converted.


But the value of the 20% INR into dollars is taken away by the RBI.


Everytime you buy Tesla, rbi keeps 20% in DOLLAR terms with themselves.



How does it matter to you?


When you ask your own money back after 9 to 18 months, 

*You will be  returned the  INR amount*.


You lost Tesla opportunity, you lost INR interest, you lost dollars, and you will again pay 20% of the 20% which was returned back to you, and you will obviously be able to fetch lesser dollars in those 20 than you would have 18 months back.



People loose 

Interest amount, + 1 % currency depreciation rate.



Now imagine how much the RBI is making by trading dollars.  Well, no need to imagine, uph can look it up officially on their websites.



The RBI literally takes away the dollars you bring via your job, exports, and gives it to the sons and daughters of their own cabal to party lavishly abroad.


They are able to get away with such a trick because people only care about reservation and reservation,  nothing else. The opposition has no interest in questioning the government on this.




I want to know, how do I point it out to US department of commerce and WTO, so that proportionally equal measures are employed on US companies,.US CITIZENS, by taking away 20% of their capitals when they want to invest in Indian markets.

post,1h9ca42,Tax Terrorism by Nirmala Tai,Mysterious_Worth_595,"
To send 50L outside India, you need to earn ~1 Cr.

To buy a car worth 15L, you need to earn 21.4L.

Why is that?
In India, you are taxed on everything.

If you earn 1Cr in India, you will likely pay at least 35% tax. ~35 Lakhs.

If you try to send the remaining 65 Lakhs outside India, That attracts another 20% TCS (Above 7L).
This will come to around 12L.

So after removing all taxes:
You get 53L for the 1Cr that you earned.

Now if we had tried to keep the money within India, then:
[1] 4-5% Currency Depreciation every year
In INR to USD terms.
[2] All types of Capital Gains are Taxed Heavily 12.5% & 20% on Stock Gains (Long-Term and
Short-Term)

-: 20% on Real Estate (Long-Term)

-: 30% on Virtual Digital Assets

Taxed at Slab (Debt Instruments, Short Term Real Estate Gains)

post,1eg1yeu,"Do you know RBI bans you to buy World's most Liquid S&P500 index fund? But allows you to buy junk international mutual funds, because Ambani is going to enter it. A timeline.",minimized_comment,"
We refuse to give money to rent seekers, non innovative doing, exploiting, wage compressing, pf blocking, insurance denying, companies like Infy, RIL, etc..



Here is how The RBI has been screwing with people like me since 2020.



1 - They banned Indmoney,  SBM bank. 

https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/23/india-central-bank-orders-sbm-local-unit-to-stop-outward-remittance-transactions/




The reason they give is that the RBI can only print rupees, not dollars, which they consider junk currency. How dare a common person refuse to become a bagholder of non-innovative Indian companies!



2 -

They barred mutual funds from investing in overseas markets. Most of the gains made by PPFS mutual funds are due to IEX, CDSL, Google, and rupee depreciation.

https://m.economictimes.com/mf/mf-news/ppfas-mutual-fund-stops-fresh-inflows-in-flexi-cap-fund/articleshow/89223892.cms


Reason : 

How will the sons-in-law of Sitaraman and Gadkari get dollars for their weddings? Who will pay for the foreign trips, sabbaticals, and study tours of worthless government officers, judges, and consultants?.




3 -

They removed indexation from debt mutual funds in March 2023. This means all mutual funds investing in companies that don't pay bribes to government officials, MPs, and MLAs will be taxed at 33%.

https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-removes-long-term-tax-benefits-debt-mutual-funds-source-2023-03-24/



Reason: 

How will the sons, daughters, and cousins of tax-concealing, bribe-seeking, bribe-giving traders do MBA abroad? The shop owner is paying zero taxes, employing 14-year-old children on the shop floor, claiming all deductions, and underreporting profits.


4 -

They banned a very specific type of mutual fund in March 2024, which invests in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq via cheap ETFs like VOO, VTI, QQQ, and QQQM.

https://www.businesstoday.in/mutual-funds/story/sebi-asks-amfi-to-stop-accepting-fresh-inflows-in-overseas-etfs-from-april-1-422416-2024-03-21



This was the *cheapest* way to invest in U.S.  markets for normal people like you and me.




But they have not banned mutual funds that don't buy cheap ETFs but buy stocks and have *VERY HIGH EXPENSE* ratios.

But they are banning you from following the most common advice given by Warren Buffett: keep buying VOO or VTI forever and you'll outperform almost everyone else.

Think about it.

BlackRock is coming and is going to launch a mutual fund for foreign markets. How dare the citizens of India access the U.S. market via a cheap mutual fund investing in cheap Vanguard VOO?

Do they care about you when you invest in crypto? Hell no. They want the dollars to send their children abroad.

That's why they put a 20% TCS on every dollar conversion you do. If you buy $100 of Tesla stock per month, you need to earn $175 per month (around $50 for income taxes, $25 for TCS).

If you even dare to ask for a return in income tax, they reject any claims by opening reassessments of previous years. This means for every $100 SIP in Tesla or Amazon, they will keep taking $70 forever, every month, always.

The RBI is directing all this. Their sons and daughters want to be a better class of Indians abroad. They don't want 'cattle class' Indians doing MS and MBA abroad. That's why they are gatekeeping by depreciating the rupee and blocking every access of the common man to dollar-based companies.

Remember, they want investment from Tesla in India so the land bank they grabbed from farmers using insider information can be overvalued, but they will behead anyone who invests in Tesla by using the Black Money Act.",2024-07-30 19:15:24,444.0,116.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1eg1yeu/do_you_know_rbi_bans_you_to_buy_worlds_most/,IndianStreetBets

chart shows that they waited for previous quarter to end, so disclosures won't show their intentions. breakout, 52wk high or all time high was made, so breakout buyers bought.

then, 1oct24, prices made top, and crashed. dump began.

in the preceding days, positive news and buy calls were given in the news. plus its obvious once the fall began, they said buy because its a value buy pr buy on dip.

post,1e1bldn,Never sell your winners.,lotus_eater_rat,"I moved to Pune in 2018 and lived near the Persistent System office. I used to pass through their building, and It may sound funny but one of the reasons to check the company was because I liked their office names. I started investing in the PPFAS mutual fund and the persistent system was one of the top holdings. I bought shares worth 45K in 2018. Sold 1/3rd in 2021 and again in 2022 to get advantage of 1 lakh LTCG tax-expectation. Also bought TATA elixir during the same period and sold it when it became 2X.

I did make some money but after seeing the further growth I promised myself that I would never sell  
unless there is something seriously wrong with the companies I am holding. Have not sold a single stock since March 2022, Remaining 15k of the persistent system is now 2.60 lakhs (17X) in 6 years. I have HDFC Bank, ITC, Persistent System, Arman Finance, Maruti, Titan, ICICI Bank, TCS, and NMDC in my portfolio.

I know my XIRR (22%) may not be impressive in today’s scenario but I would suggest don’t sell your  
winner for a small gain. If you are holding good companies, there is potential it could be 25X or 50X in the long term. Also, think what difference it will make to your wealth if u even make 5k in 6 months on a 10k investment. It will surely make a difference if u make 2.5 lakh from 10k.

ITC, because cigarettes and Yippee is better than Maggie.

BPCL because there I've been refueling there and never been scammed

CDSL because you and I are still investing and will keep on investing

DMART because I shop there monthly with no regrets

IRCTC/IRFC because I still prefer travelling via trains rather than flights

TATAPOWER/ADANIPOWER because of uninterrupted electricity except for certain regular maintenance downtime

Ofcourse, I do some fundamental analysis before I invest but I don't spend more than 15 mins per stock. It also helps that I started around 2021, during the Covid boom so my return numbers are quite skewed.

post,1jqdyek,Indian IT stocks CRASH! Here's all you need to know!,The_Market_Maven,"The Nifty IT index dropped 4.05%, with Infosys, TCS, and HCL Tech leading the fall after Trump imposed a 26% tariff on Indian imports.

But the bigger worry? Over 50% of Indian IT revenue comes from the US. If the US economy slows, companies may cut Tech budgets, hurting Indian IT firms.

Add AI automation and inflation fears, the road ahead looks uncertain.

Here's a quick breakdown:

* Trump's new tariffs are raising concerns about trade barriers and cost pressures.
* Higher U.S. inflation risks leading to tighter corporate budgets and reduced Tech spending.
* The drop in U.S. Tech stocks is impacting sentiment and demand for Indian IT services.
* The weakening dollar is affecting revenue from U.S. clients.
* AI & automation risks reducing reliance on traditional outsourcing.",2025-04-03 09:29:17,14.0,15.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1jqdyek/indian_it_stocks_crash_heres_all_you_need_to_know/,IndianStreetBets

post,1hndhl3,Anyone using Interactive brokers for buying US ETFs? What are the total charges I will have to pay? ,KAZE_786,"Hi folks,

I recently stumbled on IBKR and was researching a bit about its fees and overall processes as I wish to buy US ETFs directly without depending on indirect funds / ETFs of India 

I was confused that they ask USD500 as minimum for "" subscription of market data "" 

Is this a onetime payment or is it just that they require this as a minimum balance for enabling market data ? 

Also do they require any minimum balance apart from above? 

I also want to understand the exchange fees that are applied when I will have to wire my money to US , as I read some posts on this subreddit in past that we have to wire money there 

Also, would there be TCS implications if I am sending money overseas ?

post,1kkis1m,What do you think about Copper Market in India.,patito-potato,"* **FY24 Demand Growth**: Copper demand in India rose by 13% year-on-year in FY24, reaching 1.7 million tonnes. This surge was primarily fueled by the building construction and infrastructure sectors, which together account for 43% of copper consumption and contribute approximately 11% to the GDP. ​[Link](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/coal/copper-demand-in-india-rises-13-in-fy24-infra-and-building-sectors-drive-growth/116147769?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Import Statistics**: India imported approximately 363,000 tonnes of refined copper cathodes in the last fiscal year, primarily from Japan. Despite domestic production of 555,000 tonnes, the country still faces a supply gap due to growing demand. ​[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/adani-smelter-expansion-will-cut-indias-refined-copper-imports-government-says-2024-12-06/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Key Sectoral Contributions**:
   * **Building Construction**: Demand increased by 15% year-on-year, driven by the growing use of copper wiring and cables in construction projects.
   * **Infrastructure Expansion**: The infrastructure sector saw a 14% year-on-year growth in copper demand, particularly in the transmission and distribution of electricity.
   * **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: The transportation sector experienced a 41% year-on-year surge in EV sales, significantly boosting copper demand.
   * **Net-Zero Transition Technologies**: Copper demand associated with renewable energy systems and EVs rose by 27% year-on-year, highlighting the metal's critical role in India's energy transformation. ​[Link](https://www.bigmint.co/insights/detail/india-copper-demand-soars-by-13-y-o-y-in-fy24-driven-by-growth-in-key-sectors-606970?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Domestic Production and Strategic Investments**
   * Hindustan Copper Limited hold mine lease of 80% of India's copper reserves.
   * HCL used to be the only vertically integrated copper company. however they have moved away from refining and smelting. HCL is now focused on selling Metal in Concentrate(MIC).
   * HCL has signed MOU with Hindalco(india's largest refined copper producer) for selling copper concentrate.However, the copper mined in india is said to be of inferior quality.
   * Refined copper capacity had reduced earlier due to closure of vedanta plant in tuticorn(4ook tone per year). However, Kutch Copper(Adani Enterprises) will increase the total production of refined copper by 0.5m tons soon.
* Kutch copper are sourcing the metal concentrate from Chile.
* Govt of india has removed custom duty on import of Copper concentrate.
* Tight supplies have inflated the price of the metal. Treatment and refining charges are now in negative. RC/TCs which are major revenue source for smelters are now in negatives.
* As price of copper is highly sensitive to geopolitical movement, any movement by trump will affect the Kutch copper. Hindalco has safegaurded itself from geopolitical tensions.
* Adani Group has recently ventured into the cables and wires sector through a joint venture (JV) named **Praneetha Ecocables Limited (PEL)**. This JV was established in March 2025 between **Kutch Copper Limited (KCL)**, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises, and **Praneetha Ventures Private Limited**.
* Havells on other hand is integrated with HCL and Hindalco.
* Kutch copper is becoming vertically integrated with entire adani ecosystem.
* Higher copper concentrate price is actually bad for refiners because their RC/TC take a hit.
* Hindalco has most stable supply chain but not much domestic capacity(copper concentrate mined domestically)
* Adani Kutch copper is most setup for success as they can battle the short supply through GoI induced long term contracts with chilean govt, further vertica integration of copper products and byproducts like sulpher(fertilizers) will reduce its dependence on TC/RC.
* Copper cathode imports recorded a sharp decline in December and January, after the QCO notified by the Ministry of Mines came into effect on December 1, 2024. it requires the exporter to have BIS certificate, the quality control is more sceintific than the London Metal Exchange, a total of nine foreign suppliers have been certified under the BIS’s copper cathode standard covered by the QCO – including six from Japan, two from Malaysia, and one from Austria.

Short - fertilizers, cables once the Kutch copper becomes operational.

Long- Hindalco on assumption that it will report good earnings for Q4, due to reduced imports, global market conditions, earnings are reported before kutch plant starts operations. and offcourse Adani Ent.",2025-05-12 03:25:14,1.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1kkis1m/what_do_you_think_about_copper_market_in_india/,IndianStreetBets

post,1fbz6lj,"Hexaware Technologies Files for ₹9,950 Crore IPO - What You Need to Know!",itsjustsciencee,"Hey everyone,

Exciting news in the tech and finance world! Hexaware Technologies, a Mumbai-based IT services company, has filed its Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) with SEBI for an initial public offering (IPO) worth ₹9,950 crore12. This IPO is set to be one of the largest in India’s IT services sector since Tata Consultancy Services’ IPO over two decades ago3.

Key Highlights:

1. Promoter and Offer for Sale: The entire IPO is an offer for sale by CA Magnum Holdings, an affiliate of Carlyle Private Equity, which currently holds a 95.03% stake in Hexaware. 
2. Company Background: Hexaware was acquired by Carlyle from Baring Private Equity Asia (now EQT) in 2021 for approximately $3 billion, marking the largest private-equity deal in India at the time3. The company was delisted in 2020 and is now making a return to the stock exchanges3.
3. Financial Performance: For the year ending December 2023, Hexaware reported a revenue of $1.26 billion, a 7.8% increase from the previous year3. The company earns 72% of its revenue from the Americas, with a significant portion of its workforce based in the Asia Pacific region3.
4. Service Offerings: Hexaware provides a range of services including IT, business process outsourcing, cloud computing, data analytics, and artificial intelligence solutions3. It serves various industries such as financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and more3.
5. Legal Proceedings: The DRHP mentions two ongoing criminal proceedings against Hexaware, one related to environmental norms and the other to unfair labor practices3.
6. Market Impact: If successful, this IPO will be the largest in India’s IT services sector since TCS’s ₹4,713 crore IPO3. The equity shares are planned to be listed on both BSE and NSE3.

Why This Matters:

Hexaware’s IPO is a significant event for investors and the tech industry. It highlights the growing importance of IT services and the potential for substantial returns. The company’s strong financial performance and diverse service offerings make it an attractive investment opportunity.

They have a growing and youthful population, and their infrastructure and energy consumption are also on the rise. It seems that quite a few investors are eyeing India for its potential growth. (source: The Bid: Is India the next global grothw powerhouse?).

Does anyone here have experience with the Indian market? Any advice or recommendations before I dive into. I have listed out some potential companies and there is an EFT (iShares MSCI India FTE run buy BlackRock).

I have losted out some potential stocks with chat GPT:
	1.	Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) - Reliance continues to be a dominant force in India’s energy, retail, and telecommunications sectors. With its massive investments in digital services and clean energy, Reliance is poised for long-term growth.
	2.	Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) - As one of the largest IT services companies in the world, TCS continues to benefit from the global demand for digital transformation services. Its strong financial performance and consistent growth make it a solid choice.
	3.	HDFC Bank - HDFC Bank is one of the most stable and well-performing banks in India. Its consistent focus on expanding its retail and digital banking services has contributed to its robust growth trajectory.
	4.	Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL) - Part of the Adani Group, this company is a leader in the renewable energy sector in India. With India’s increasing focus on green energy, AGEL is expected to continue its rapid growth.
	5.	Infosys - Another major player in the IT services sector, Infosys has a strong global presence and continues to innovate in areas such as cloud computing, AI, and digital services.
	6.	Bharti Airtel - As one of India’s largest telecommunications providers, Bharti Airtel is well-positioned to benefit from the country’s growing internet and mobile phone penetration, especially with the ongoing rollout of 5G services.
	7.	Larsen & Toubro (L&T) - L&T is a major engineering and construction company in India. Its diverse business portfolio, which includes infrastructure, energy, and defense, is expected to drive growth in the coming years

comment,1eunmdp,,,,,,,linfatm,drm200,Not a business friendly environment.  We wanted to build a factory extension there. We already owned the property. We needed like 30 permits from various agencies to proceed. Everyone had their hand out for cash in order to “move the permits along”.  My company (American) would not do that.   In the end we hired a very  very expensive Indian consulting company to manage the permitting process.  The consulting company quickly resolved our permitting problems …. I assume they paid the bribes that we would not.,2024-08-18 01:12:18,13.0,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eunmdp/investing_in_india_as_a_next_growth_powerhouse/,investing

post,1eijdf6,"Investment in USD-Treasury bills from India
",natz1308,"Could someone provide information on whether investments can be made in USD T bills /ETF in the USA without any LRS restrictions for individuals or entities from India

Note: 

1) I came across information that RBI has a total limitations of $7Billion for all investment funds sent to US 

2) limit for individuals may be $250000, however TCS is deducted post 7 Lakhs INR for own funds

3) what are the limits for institutions for similar investments?

Any way around ?",2024-08-02 19:48:37,0.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eijdf6/investment_in_usdtreasury_bills_from_india/,investing
comment,1eijdf6,,,,,,,lg6zeak,ramjithunder24,"1. you're on the wrong sub, this is a general investing sub and not an indian personal finance sub. This means that people have no clue what you mean by LRS and lakhs and etc. 
2. I suggest you look for ETFs listed on the BSE or NSE that closely track one of the US treasury bill ETFs like IEF and TLT. 
3. I'm not Indian so I have no clue how things work over there but here in Korea there are ETFs listed on the KRX that follow TLT like [this](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/KRX-476760/technicals/) one. If there are any listed on the NSE or BSE, they should have a similar name and contain words such as T-Bond"" and ""USA"". 
4. If you do find such an ETF, do check the holdings of the ETF to see that they are actually holding US gov bonds, you can do this with Yahoo finance under the tab called ""holdings""",2024-08-02 20:02:25,7.0,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eijdf6/investment_in_usdtreasury_bills_from_india/,investing
