post,1k3f1q3,Going through HDFC & ICICI results… what are you guys thinking?,nafi_najeeb,"Was checking out the quarterly results for HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, pretty interesting stuff this time.

comment,1jexqij,,,,,,,mimywk8,Heisenburg4,"Hi Buddy,
I am owning HDFC since 2019, bought some more during March 2020 crash. I went all in on my savings at that point in time. Kept accumulating more in the coming years.

I think the well managed private banks are still undervalued (Kotak and HDFC), although they have performed well. They have grown their profits at more than 20% CAGR and reinvested the earnings at the rate. The later part of the sentence is very very important and changes the game. 

Can you tell me any other business where a company earns more than 10,000 crores in profits and reinvests it again at the same rate. It’s a compounding machine like no other. My advice would be to hold it, until you really need the money. This is as good a company as it gets. 

You are in a good business. Why sell?
Think like you own the company, not just a stock, just because you can sell doesn’t mean you should. 

Also a fact:

HDFC Bank completed 26 years since its IPO in May 1995.

Without dividends reinvested the CAGR has been 25% .

With dividends reinvested CAGR is 30%.

Max Correction been 55% .

It didn’t depend on bidding; it was a straight swap based on entitlement, as part of corporate restructuring.

post,1krsffl,Should I pay the final premium before surrendering my HDFC Sanchay Par policy?,Primary-Day-8466,"I've been paying ₹1 lakh annually for an HDFC Life policy for the past 5 years (total paid: ₹5 lakhs). I’ve received ₹24,000 per year as yearly benefits (₹1.2 lakhs so far).

I have 1 more year left to complete the 6-year premium term. However, if I surrender the policy now, I’m being offered only ₹2,02,250, which means a total loss of ₹1.8 lakhs (5L paid – 1.2L benefit – 2L surrender value).

|**Policy Year**|**Premium Paid (₹)**|**Payout Received (₹)**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Year 1|1,04,500|24,000|
|Year 2|1,02,250|24,000|

|Year 5|1,02,250|24,000|
|Year 6|—|—|
|**Total Paid**|**5,13,500**|**1,20,000**|

**Question:**  
Would it make sense to pay the final ₹1 lakh premium and then surrender to reduce my loss or possibly break even? Or should I just cut my losses now and surrender? I majorly do not want to lose any amount that I invested.

Would love to hear what others in this situation have done or any advice from experienced folks.

post,1juim9q,HDFC Flexi Cap Fund vs ICICI Pru Large & Mid Cap Fund – Which suits a college student with moderate risk appetite?,SuspiciousEqual6266,"Hi everyone,
I'm a 21-year-old college student looking to start a SIP with a long-term horizon (5–10+ years). My risk appetite is moderate—I'm open to some ups and downs but don’t want to take extreme risks.

I've narrowed it down to these two funds:

HDFC Flexi Cap Fund

ICICI Prudential Large & Mid Cap Fund


HDFC Flexi Cap seems more dynamic, while ICICI Pru Large & Mid Cap looks more balanced. For someone starting out with moderate risk tolerance, which fund would be a better fit?

2.) low risk but sustainable return, fund houses enter at the low level and keep averaging. for example, today hdfc is 1661, on 9 Feb it was 1403, since then it has returned 15% which is double than any FD with limited/low risk.",2024-06-22 08:55:41,17.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1dlq0p9/why_are_mutual_funds_holding_hdfc_if_so_many/,IndianStockMarket

post,1i6ekaw,How bad of an idea is it to short sell stocks with HDFC securities trading account?,jackal_boy,"I have been only making profits by buying low and selling high all these years. (With mid to long term investments)

But i feel like I am missing out on some really good opportunities sometimes where I could make good money even in a bear market, especially without having to wait so much for my investment to grow in value.

So far i avoided short selling thinking it's too risky, like F&O.

But the more I have learnt about the market and different strategies in all these years, i am starting to realise that maybe short selling isn't as risky as F&O atleast. Like, I think I understand enough about the market and risk management now that I could do it successfully enough to make an overall profit.

There is just one problem.

I'm really confused about the requirements of making short selling work without brokerage and other charges costing more than your investment itself.

I haven't had to worry about that for mid to long term investments coz the price movements are obviously much larger and so are my profits in comparison to any brokerage fees or extra charges. (Like, I don't even pay much attention to it coz I know I'll still be in overall profit)

But with short selling the price movements are very small in comparison, and i hear everyone saying i need a discount broker to avoid having to pay a fee that are greater than what I earned. Is that really true? How big of a difference does it make?

I am currently using hdfc securities as my broker.

I guess I could make a zerodha account too, but I'm too lazy and would like to know if I even need to put in that effort before having to go through with that.",2025-01-21 09:02:59,3.0,13.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1i6ekaw/how_bad_of_an_idea_is_it_to_short_sell_stocks/,IndianStockMarket

* **Reported in-line earnings**, but with **margins contracting by 3bps QoQ**.
* **Strong deposit growth**, but **advances growth tepid** as the bank focuses on reducing the **CD ratio** at an accelerated pace.
* **CASA ratio** declined to **34%**, which is a slight concern but aligns with strategic goals.
* **Asset quality** showed a marginal deterioration, with **PCR declining to \~67.8%**. However, the bank has **healthy provisions** (floating + contingent) of **INR 259b** (1% of loans), providing a buffer.
* Given the focus on reducing the CD ratio, **moderation in loan growth** is expected in **FY25/FY26** to **5%/10%**.
* The **gradual retirement of high-cost borrowings** and an improvement in **operating leverage** will likely support return ratios in the coming years.
* **Earnings estimate cut by 3% for FY26/27**, reflecting slower loan growth and **CASA moderation**.
* HDFC Bank is expected to deliver **FY26E RoA/RoE** of **1.8%/13.9%**.

post,1eqxaix,Buy HDFC Bank Shares?,Swarnaditya_Maitra,"MSCI just announced that it will maintain HDFC Bank in its indices, and bump up the 'Foreign Inclusion Factor' for the stock from 0.37 to 0.56. Foreign Inclusion Factor (FIF) in MSCI indices is the proportion of shares available for purchase in the public equity markets by international investors. If HDFC Bank's FIF is 0.56, it means 56 percent of its shares are available for foreign investment in the index.

The latest foreign ownership opens up the ‘foreign room' in HDFC Bank to more than 25 percent, necessary for MSCI to include a stock at its full market-cap weight. 
With this inclusion, the bank is likely to get MSCI inflow of up to $5 billion, according to some market participants.

post,1f8pqxq,Whether I should surrender HDFC Life Sanchay plus policy?,Moist_Preference_163,"Hi, I had taken HDFC Life Sanchay plus policy in 2019 (at a time when I wasn't too well-versed with investments). The details of the policy is as below:-

Policy tenure- 11 years
Premium payment term- 10 years
Premium amount - 40k per annum 
Sum assured - 5.2 lakhs at the end of the policy
Premium paid - 20k out of 40k for 2024

I am getting surrender value of Rs. 1.68 lakh. The premium I have paid till now is around Rs. 2.2 lakhs. If I surrender the policy right now, I'll be losing around Rs. 50k. If I follow through, I'll be paying around Rs. 4 lakh in premium and would be receiving around Rs 5.2 lakh on 2030.

But I'm aware that investment + insurance is not a good idea but just wanted to get a sense if it does make sense to surrender the policy, take the loss and invest it in stocks/ mutual funds.

I had paid 2 premiums amounting to 2.04 lakhs

So I decided to pull the plug on this policy but didn't surrender. It has moved to Paid-up status, meaning I will be insured for 3L and I will get reduced returns (as I am not paying it for 10 years) as per the standard policy rate.

So you have 2 options - surrender vs paid up now. But do it in any case. Don't continue with the shitty policy.",2024-09-04 16:57:29,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1f8pqxq/whether_i_should_surrender_hdfc_life_sanchay_plus/,IndianStockMarket

post,1grc1te,HDFC Life Insurance share price movement,Ok_Set_6991,"HDFC Life Insurance Company is one of the life insurance companies in my portfolio apart from LIC.

While LIC's share price has been down more than 25% from its 52-week high price, HDFC Life's share price has not been volatile and has been down by hardly 10%.

While I don't understand why HDFC Life shares have not been subjected to selling leading to the share price remaining reasonably stable, I noticed the DII holdings have increased from 11.24% in June 2024 to 13.25% in September 2024.

The Q2 results have also been decent, with revenue up 22% year over year and profit growing 14% year over year.

While the PE ratio of the company might be on the higher side, the growth in revenue and profits seems to justify the high PE. The company also has a low debt-to-equity ratio and is almost debt-free.

Interestingly HDFC Life has the highest margins (26% new business margins i.e. the profit margin on new policies issued during a period). It also has a diversified product mix and distribution mix that helps HDFC Life tackle the cyclicality of capital markets and changes in the regulatory and macro environment.

India has a life insurance penetration of less than 3%. There is a large opportunity to expand the life insurance business given the favorable demographics, rising prosperity, growing household income, and increasing awareness of the need for financial protection.

Considering all the above factors, what is your opinion on adding HDFC Life Insurance shares in small quantities? What are some more insights and analysis about the company fundamentals and share price movement of the company?",2024-11-14 18:48:27,5.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1grc1te/hdfc_life_insurance_share_price_movement/,IndianStockMarket

post,1edgpl4,Thoughts on next HDFC Bank,_The_Numbers_Guy,"HDFC Bank is showing signs of becoming too big. Beyond a certain size, growth becomes nominal. So am expecting the best days of HDFC growth is behind it and anything going forward will be strictly on par with the industry. (Similar to SBI).

  
So in a hunt for the next HDFC Bank which can consistently grow at 20% a year, i came up with list of few parameters to shortlist and are as follows:

- Management (Esp. CEO, History in Indian banks indicate extra ordinary person on the driving seat can do wonders e.g. Uday Kotak, Aditya Puri etc.)

- Strategy (Primary focus to digitalization and other aspects)

- Growth Levers (MSME, Retail etc.)

Here's my shortlist and reasoning behind it. Please let me know your views on this sector and my shortlist.

  
- Federal Bank (New person on the wheel; Strategy till now was solid but i am expecting a shift as the way Kotak Mahindra works and Federal worked were stark opposite; So would rather wait and watch)

- IDFC First Bank: Good Strategy, One of the best Digital platforms and CEO is well respected by Industry (My best bet)

- South Indian Bank: Following Federal Bank's footsteps - Kerala styled banking; Very attractive valuations 

- Bandhan Bank: Strategically sound but concerned with West Bengal Politics

- RBL Bank: M&M's entry makes it interesting. But yet to see a turnaround.

  
Rejects:

- Axis Bank: None of my friends who had citi have loads of complaints and are not happy

- ICICI Bank: Already behaves like HDFC so not expecting exponential growth

- Indusind: Personally use this bank but Hinduja group's focus on growth is non-existent for years. If management gives a solid guidance this will become favorite pick as their service is top-notch.

post,1ivfrsv,"HDFC Ergo increased premium after 1st year, Should I Switch from HDFC Ergo to Star Health Insurance? Need Advice!",MranonymousSir,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently have the Optima Secure health insurance policy with HDFC Ergo:

Cover: ₹20 lakhs

Riders: Unlimited restore & hospital cash

Premium: ₹15,048 last year

Renewal premium: ₹16,184 this year (₹1,136 increase, ~7.5% hike)


My renewal is due next month, but I’ve been getting calls from Star Health offering:

Same ₹20 lakh coverage & benefits

Reduced PED waiting period

Premium: ₹13,000 (assured fixed till age 35)

Top-up of ₹1 crore for just ₹2,000


Recently, I was hospitalized for chest issues (angio, echo, all normal, but diagnosed with ""coronary artery symptoms""). I was in the ICU, filed for reimbursement with HDFC Ergo, and they processed the full amount smoothly.

Given your experiences with HDFC Ergo vs. Star Health, should I switch to Star? Is it worth the cost savings, or should I stick with HDFC Ergo since they handled my claim well?

Would love to hear your thoughts!

post,1ecgr3d,"Do not buy HDFC ergo ever. They are the biggest cheats!
",Firm-Koala5681,"I had bought hdfc ergo health insurance policy for my senior citizen parents for a sum insured of 4l and was paying around 45l for 2 yrs of cover in 2018. It had a waiting period of 4 yrs for existing diseases which in my case was both hypertension and diabetes for both the parties. In 2020 they doubled the charges citing that the previous policy doesnt exist and now the company is porting you to a new policy, I was naive enough to not question how can they do this without prior intimation. Anyway forward to 2024 where my policy is expiring in August '24 and I had asked them for a quote in July first week, they gave me a whopping premium of 1.77l for 2 yrs which is almost the double of what I paid before 2 years. Anyway I tried negotiating and it wasnt fruitful. spoke to the grievience officer and he also mentioned nothing can be done. Yesterday I decided to renew it and tried doing it from the site, it showed some technical error and asked me to reach out to the nearest branch or call the customer care. I did that and guess what now they tell me to cough up 2.24l for a cover of 5l for 2 yrs. I couldnt understand what was happening but then googled to find out that they were again stopping the hdfc suraksha policy and are porting all the existing users to hdfc optima secure which is why this cost just shot up.

My problem is they didnt intimate this earlier and the grievience office until yesterday was stuck with the old pricing and the customer care is demanding me to pay 2.24l for a shitty 5l cover. I dont have an option anymore because my policy is expiring in just a few days so they have just left me helpless, I dont have an option to port. Isnt it hdfc's responsibility to let their customers know beforehand that a policy is going ot be invalid after a certain date and it will port its users? This would atleast let the customers decide beforehand to be ready with other options. What can be the course of action against them? I wonder arent others facing this issue?

Now my dad was detected with multiple myleloma in 2022 and underwent chemo till 2023. I am sure the cost shot up because of it but it is unfair to not let me know about what they are going to do with my policy and how I will be affected, they just trap you with their unethical handling of policies and unfortunately IRDAI is not doing a lot to protect the citizens.

There are ways to minimize expenses on these plans by combining multiple important details. For example, here's an example because I don't know about you. 

1) Your Corporate group health insurance provides insurance cover for employees, that might include Parents. 

If yes, then don't stop this, and use this as base health insurance, because it doesn't have any waiting period, no PED issues and claims can be settled easily.

2) Take a separate Rs 4 or 5 lakh individual/ floater base health insurance from a private or government company for parents, you will pay the premium, get tax benefits under section 80D up to 50k

This plan, as purchased for the 1st time, will have an Initial waiting period, 2 years listed disease waiting period, PED waiting period is any PED. 

3) Along with the Base plan, go for a super top-up cover, 50 lakh or 1 crore. 

Combination of all 3 will have a higher chance to settle claims. You have to pay a premium anyhow.

post,1kfgmqm,How to save yourself from bank fraud and my experience with it.,lizrojer,"

**Backdrop of the event:**
My ICICI account received a credit of ₹24,000 in late February. It was deposited via a cash deposit machine (CDM).

I **had no idea** about this deposit at the time (I usually check only the debits in this account, not the credits).

About a week later, in early March, I got a call. The person on the other end claimed he had accidentally deposited ₹24,000 into my account and wanted it back.

I assumed it was a fraud call and laughed it off. Before hanging up, he offered me two options to return the money—GPay or a cash deposit into a CDM. I still laughed it off. When I said I wouldn't return any money (because, again, I didn't even know such money had come to me), he threatened to go to the police. I was like, *what the hell?* Even if you deposited money into my account by mistake, how does that make me legally liable? I didn’t ask you to!

Later, after the call, I checked my bank statement—and sure enough, there was a credit of ₹24,000 on the exact date he mentioned.

I felt sympathetic and called him back. I told him to contact his home branch and send a formal letter to my branch. After verifying that he was truly the one who deposited the money, I’d authorize a debit from my account via proper banking channels.

**BUT HERE’S THE ZINGER:**

Suddenly, I began receiving repeated calls from his bank branch pressuring me to return the money **without** any formal letter from the branch. I stood firm. Eventually, they emailed me saying I had *three days* to return the money (not sure how they pulled that deadline out of thin air).

This is when things started smelling fishy. I withdrew all my funds from ICICI Bank (except the ₹24,000 in question) and moved them to another bank. I also filed a formal complaint to the head of phone banking, pointing out three major issues:

1. How did a third party get my personal details like bank account number, name, phone number, email ID, and branch info?
2. Why is ICICI trying to pressure me into paying back money without first verifying who deposited it?
3. If this continues, I’ll advise my entire family to move their considerable funds out of ICICI to a bank like HDFC.

That got their attention. Higher-ups from the bank contacted me, and an “investigation” is now underway.

After I declined to return the money directly, that dude's ICICI branch sent me a letter—on official letterhead—but cleverly avoided stating that the deposit was indeed made by this person. They simply wrote that *he claims* the money was his and, based on his letter, they want me to approve a debit.

I flat-out refused.

I responded saying I need **four things**, without which I will not approve any transfer—**under any circumstances**:

1. **An undertaking from ICICI** stating that they’ve conducted a full due diligence investigation and verified, without a doubt, that the person claiming the deposit is the one who actually made it.

2. **An indemnity bond from ICICI** saying that if any legal, financial, tax, or other issues arise from this transfer in the future, **ICICI will be fully responsible**. This bond must be valid in perpetuity.

3. **An affidavit from the alleged depositor** stating that the deposit was made by mistake, that the money is rightfully his, and that it was not obtained or used for any illegal activity (to protect me from any future money laundering implications).

4. **A certificate of finality from ICICI** stating that once I approve the transfer after reviewing these documents, **they will never contact me about this matter again** and will not entertain any future queries from third parties regarding this.

After this, ICICI suddenly woke up and agreed to send all the required documents.

Now let’s see what happens next—it’s going to be interesting.

**Modus Operandi of the fraud:**

**Scenario 01**

Someone transfers money to your account. Then they call you, claim it was a mistake, and ask you to return it. Wanting to do the right thing, you comply. Then *they* apply for a chargeback from the bank. Now the bank liens your account. So for every ₹100, they potentially get ₹200. For ₹24,000, that’s ₹48,000. Neat little trick.

**Scenario 02**

The person transfers money into your account BY CASH and then guilt trips you/threatens you through police action into paying him back through gpay or cash deposit on CDM. You do it. Now he can claim to have received that money as business income. So by just having a hundred bank account details, he can clear 24 Lakhs of money from black to white. 

Any bank will have millions of bank accounts. So a branch employee can get a small cut of the profit by supplying a few hundred of them. The scam artist makes a crore of white money, the victims are none the wiser (because they just paid back what was credited to them) and the bank guy will probably make some thousands for a few minutes of work!

And if tomorrow he gets caught, by bad luck or political zealousness, you will be a accessory to that game- helping someone to launder their money. I mean maybe you can plead your innocence but would you want to take that risk of trying to convince cops of how you weren't a part of it? You will probably have to pay some sort of monies to keep the cops away (which is a tragedy but a v real thing!)

Ergo, I have a big sus that the officials of that person's bank branch may be involved in it!

DO NOT FALL FOR IT! ASK FOR ALL THE DOCUMENTS.
 
PS : I have to thank legaladviceindia and this subreddit. I made posts on both when it first happened and they were the ones who told me to transfer my money to another account + not to pay back directly. 

Even if logic says that you should not pay directly, but when you hear humans on the other side, your logic side of the brain goes sideways and you are like will I be a bad person if I don't return directly? That's where the con gets you. 

Also I mean this could be a really geniune case of a mistaken transaction. But yeah, even if it be that, i would seriously advice not to pay back without asking for those documents.

post,1ej35zi,HDFC Securities has parted ways with Stockal and partnered with Vested,yashg,"It seems HDFC Securities who were offering the Global Investing platform in partnership with Stockal have ended that relationship and joined hands with Vested. And both of them are trying to keep the customers to continue with them. Last week, I got a mail from HDFC Sec saying Global Investing 2.0 is here. I didn't think much of it. Then yesterday I received a mail from Global Investing telling me my account has been upgraded for free to Gold (I am a Silver member). Then today I got a call from HDFC Sec asking me to click on some link on an email they had sent me to transfer my account with Vested. I mailed Global Investing to confirm if my account has been upgraded to Gold and they replied back saying I have to give my consent to keep the account with them. I am confused and a bit pissed with all these shenanigans of these companies.

Just a few months back Groww suddenly decided to close their US stocks offering. After some backlash they said you can continue to hold the stocks but can't buy any new, just sell and withdraw the money. I transferred from Groww to Global Investing and now they are acting up.

>However, since HDFC Securities has a new partner, they would have offered to migrate your account to this new partner - Vested.

Then, nothing happens on 11th year, from 12th year onwards, I receive 1,07,000 back for next 10 years

After this 10 years, (basically 21st year from now), I will get the whole 11 lakhs I paid in my first 10 year period

Is this some kind of investment/pension plan, or am I being scammed? He asked me to share few details immediately, and he will send official email.

Then you systematically withdraw 107000 per year for 10 years while growing at 6% you are left with a balance of 1422367 out of which the company will payback 1100000, keeping a profit of nearly 3 lakhs rupees.

If the insurance company manages to get 7% interest per year the profit it keeps is nearly 7 lakhs and that exponentially grows with what the insurance companies manage to get. 

These guaranteed income plans also help these companies in maintains cash flows

An agent also received nearly 30-35% of premium you give in the first year so these policies are beneficial for them

No agent usually doesn’t means less premiums

I haven't invested on anything else apart from MFs. I am thinking either to get a SIP kinda of gold plan from any jeweller or get gold ETFs. This is because I want to add gold as an investment, could be used for future marriage or consider an investment. 

I am looking for better ways to invest the rest 50k I have preferably on something which I can do like a SIP.

1. I don't like Quant mutual funds due to the noise around them and the volatilty.  
2. Parag Parikh Flexi Cap is OG, for a reason. Their stock picking and thesis is no BS and extremely smart. Maximum allocation there.  
3. HDFC Mid Cap opportunities is great as well for longer horizon  
4. Read more about ICICI Value Discovery fund - a dark horse.

If I was looking for good sleep at night for next 20 years with index beating returns,  
I would go for a combination of PP Flexi, HDFC Midcap, ICICI Value Discovery, a Gold ETF fund and just turn off rest of the noise.

comment,1kypnm0,,,,,,,mv4g3ad,faltugiribuster,"I honestly don’t understand why people chase high returns even for emergency funds. Why is it so hard to assume the worst, or at least accept that we simply don’t know what might come?

Emergencies aren’t just financial events; they’re emotional, distressing, and often chaotic. In those moments, you’re not calm or calculating. You’re not sitting down to compare NAVs or log into portals to redeem mutual funds. You’re reacting. You’re trying to cope. Rational thought takes a backseat.

That’s why emergency funds should be about access, certainty, and speed. Not returns.

Here are some examples of emergencies since you would like to know. Don’t respond with “You would borrow” to any of these.


- Funeral Expenses:
If a family member passes away unexpectedly, funeral arrangements (and subsequent days of rituals), travel, and related expenses need to be handled immediately.

- Immediate Legal or Financial Assistance:
In case of sudden legal issues or unexpected court fees.

- Travel for Family Emergency:
In the event of an urgent family emergency (like a parent falling critically ill), someone who lives closer to them needs money urgently to take care, while you are travelling.

- Sibling attempts sui*ide
Police is involved. Your presence is constantly required.

- Your child goes missing
Authorities demand your presence. Need some money manage miscellaneous expenses.

- Floods / riots
State internet blackout. House torched by goons. You need to move your family to safety and manage expenses. Bank branches may be accessed. 


These are not “just” financial problems. They are life events that demand your time, attention, energy and physical presence.",2025-05-30 19:31:06,13.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/1kypnm0/i_26_m_have_close_to_100k_to_invest_monthly_need/,IndiaInvestments

In India, there are only 3 companies over $100 billion - RIL with $200 billion at the top followed by TCS and HDFC.

Either of the two things can be true:

1. The US market is blown out of proportion
2. Indian market has not scaled as much as the US market after Covid

I mean the difference between the marketcap is just ginormous. It's trillions of dollars. I mean NIFTY500 marketcap is pretty much the marketcap of one company - Apple. Crazy when you think about it.

Seeking advice on a ₹1 crore home loan. Assuming processing fees are waived, current offers are:

* Central Bank of India: 7.85%
* Indian Bank: 7.9%
* Bank of Maharashtra: 7.9%
* Union Bank of India: 7.95%
* Bank of Baroda: 8.15%
* State Bank of India: 8.15%
* HDFC Bank: 8.25%

**Looking for your insights on:**

1. **Best Bank Choice & Why?** Considering factors beyond just the quoted ROI.
2. **Overall Experience:** Any feedback on these banks regarding:
   * Transparency (any unexpected/hidden costs)?
   * Actual processing & disbursement speed?
   * Customer service (pre & post-loan)?
   * Ease of prepayment or other servicing?
3. **Recent Loan Takers (from these banks):** What was the *actual lowest Rate of Interest* you successfully negotiated recently for a similar loan amount?
4. **Banks to Avoid/Prefer?** Any strong recommendations or warnings based on your home loan experiences?
5. **Crucial Factors Beyond ROI?** What else should I prioritise when making this decision?

comment,1h1pr1i,,,,,,,lzdj6g2,fashioninstahub,"As HDFC Bank approaches its 3-year resistance level of around1,800, it's at a critical point. There's a bullish RMI crossover suggesting momentum in favor of the stock, and its current price-to-book (P/B) average is -2 standard deviations below its historical average. There are a few things to keep in mind when considering this combination of factors:

Resistance at 1,800: This price level has historically been a big deal. To move above this level, you'd need strong institutional support and positive market sentiment.

Valuation Concerns: HDFC Bank's P/B ratio is 2.89, which is significantly higher than the industry median of 1.36, so the stock is trading at a premium. This could indicate overvaluation, but it also reflects the bank's strong brand, solid finances, and growth prospects.

Market Context: Overall, the banking and financial sector is doing well, with strong credit growth and improving asset quality. HDFC Bank's solid earnings and stable outlook suggest it can handle short-term volatility.

Outlook:

As [HDFC Bank shares](https://web.stockedge.com/share/hdfc-bank/5051) could be overvalued and have strong fundamentals, if it can break decisively above 1,800, it might aim higher. It's possible a false breakout could trigger a pullback if this level doesn't hold. Be on the lookout for upcoming earnings and macroeconomic signals",2024-11-28 07:35:39,1.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1h1pr1i/hdfc_bank_at_make_or_break_levels/,StockMarketIndia

I tried selling a stock on high one day and it didn't work. 

So I was like maybe the volume and chaos didn't let it happen.

Then I sold on a random slow Monday and it's still not selling. 

Is it not just sell > validate CDSL > wait for money to be credited ?

comment,1jtgf44,,,,,,,mlu8dbj,krishmk,I had been holding bearish bet on pharma with a combination of CE/PE even before he announced it. Last friday - even before I could react - the prices moved too quickly making very minimal profit - but luckily I carried forward my trades - yesterday night I had placed a limit order of 83.45 Rs. on Aurobindo 1080PE which was the higher circuit limit (for that option price). If you check the exchange prices today - mine got executed at the highest point of the day.

post,1dvwlmf,HDFC Bank: Turning Institutions Into Bagholders Since 2019,VenCoriolis,"In the last 5 years, HDFC Bank gave 33% returns. That's 6.6% returns annualized.

I can get 7%+ annualized returns from an FD. Hell, I can get ~8% from even liquid funds. 

With negligible risk.

YTD, the stock tanked ~3% and in the last 1 year, it's down by another ~1.5%. In the last 2 years, it gave 10.26% which comes to 5.13% annualized.

In the last 3 years, it gave 3.64%* which is 1.21% annually.

*Value Research Online

Under those conditions, how the F are people even defending this stock? If you want safety, go for FDs. If you want growth, you won't find it here.

HDFC Bank is literally *the* stock EVERY major institution is bagholding.
 
It's literally HILARIOUS to see people defend this stock to death as if the company belongs to their father.

I mean, if you're a trader, it's fine. But from an investment perspective? It's absolutely horrendous.

The only reason the stock even exists is because everyone's either a direct or indirect bagholder. But the prospects don't look so great for the stock.

So, better to not have false hopes. HDFC Bank is long dead. Institutions are holding it because they're forced to, not because they want to.",2024-07-05 12:17:33,36.0,34.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1dvwlmf/hdfc_bank_turning_institutions_into_bagholders/,IndianStreetBets

You can now connect your Kite account to Claude (Anthropic) or AI dev tools like Cursor, Windsurf, etc.

Use natural language to do stuff like:
“What stocks do I hold?”
“Show my GTTs with SL above 5%”
“Compare HDFC and ICICI returns over the past year”
“Highlight positions underperforming Nifty”
“Trigger this webhook if any stock in my portfolio hits RSI < 30”

No fancy dashboards. No typing in filters. Just pure prompt.

Also: it’s not some janky bot. It uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) open standard, cleanly permissioned, and privacy-first. Zerodha actually did this the right way.

Not for everyone, but if you’re the kind who writes your own Excel macros or trades with API access… this is one of the most quietly powerful things released by a brokerage in India.",2025-05-22 04:22:29,1046.0,75.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1kshzen/zerodha_just_dropped_one_of_the_coolest_tech/,IndianStreetBets

comment,1grf878,,,,,,,lx75yy2,3D_Noob_Guy,"I've stopped trusting or even listening to these so-called experts. Their views used to be relevant back in the day but not anymore. These days most of them share their 'opinion' just for the sake of creating liquidity. They're nothing more than the finfluencers who 'don't recommend' you certain stocks for the purpose of pump and dump. And these bastards play it well, where out of 10 opinions they make sure to give you 2-3 correct ones so you won't lose your trust in them. Meanwhile, the remaining majority of the opinions are for the sake of creating liquidity for the big players. Also, this one is for retailers - if you want to invest in the market, invest for either long term ( more than 5 years) or just don't and simply do trading. Long term is the only way you're guaranteed a higher probability of profit. Many companies tumbledown a lot in just 2-3 months and people start calling it a crash. That is what's happening right now. If you look at long-term charts of a lot of companies (at least in 1 year) most of them are still giving good returns. So, if you're planning to buy stocks, have the patience to stick with it or else just do intraday. With all the suggestions people ask for on this sub, they should be getting plenty of info and knowledge on how to take a position... 😑😑😑",2024-11-15 02:50:10,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1grf878/really_its_great_now_not_at_1400_6_months_back/,IndianStreetBets

post,1i5ll6f,Investor-centric Analysis of HDFC AMC Q3 FY25 Earnings Call (including Red Flags & Positive Surprises),Broad-Research5220,"**Risks**

1. Recent changes in TER and distributor commission regulations, particularly on NFOs, have impacted margins.
2. High SIP discontinuation rates and reduced ticket sizes in SIPs.

  
**Growth Oppurtunities**

1. Despite slower incremental additions, the AMC added over 40 lakh new investors in the past 12 months
2. The AMC continues to dominate in the ""Hybrid & Balanced Advantage Funds"" category, particularly with its INR 90,000 crore balanced advantage fund.
3. With 25 new offices added in the past year and synergies with HDFC Bank, the AMC is well-positioned to deepen its market penetration.

  
**Industry-Specific Headwinds/Tailwinds**

*Tailwinds:*

* AUM growth is supported by increasing SIP contributions (gross SIP AUM at INR 13 lakh crore) and rising awareness of mutual fund products among retail investors.
* Efforts by SEBI to enhance transparency and trust in mutual funds

*Headwinds:*

* Decline in investor ticket sizes and an increase in cancellations
* Competition in thematic and passive fund categories is intensifying, with newer players entering the space.

  
**Shifts in Customer Behavior and Demand Trends**

* Retail and HNI investors are increasingly opting for cost-efficient options.
* Investors are showing interest in thematic funds. 



**Red Flags**

* High SIP discontinuation rates and a decline in average SIP ticket sizes are concerning
* The AMC’s equity market share growth is stagnating
* Limited growth in fixed-income AUM or hybrid funds could make the AMC vulnerable in prolonged equity downturns.



**Positive Surprises**

* Despite regulatory changes, the AMC achieved a marginal improvement in equity fund yields (58 bps).
* Cost control measures, such as non-material increases in employee expenses despite branch expansion

These three stocks have been the biggest money printers for the past **twenty years** for there investors. Behind which the companies have also done very well. I understand that now they are very large cap established companies and won't be giving the same kind of returns like they did in the past. However India is a growing market and these companies are growing wildly along India.

The loan book growth and it's health has a stellar track record in the case for all three mentioned banks/NBFC. Revenues and profit are growing at a very good pace for a large cap company. And even the profit margins are steady. There technology, management chain and product offering is at par if not superior than there competition in almost all of the cases. And as India develops further these giants are ready to provide the capital needed for it and make money for themselves and there investors just like USA had mastercard, bank of america, jp morgan. So I am heavily betting on them. And I intend to invest bigger amounts in them even though in the short term (past 3 years) they have not done so well.

I would love to know and understand your thoughts regarding these. Have you any investment in these? Do you see any cons/risks with these companies in the current scenario for the next 5-10 years. 

Bonus from my side- In HDFC i have invested from another account. Following the above theme I have also invested in SBI cards and bank bees. And will increase my investments in them similarly.",2024-08-28 14:38:20,1.0,4.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1f3bvhr/your_thoughts_on_the_finance_giants_of_india/,IndianStreetBets

post,1dvyinl,Analyzing HDFC Bank's Q1 Performance and Stock Decline,ManishVishav,"**Introduction:**

HDFC Bank has experienced a significant decline in its stock price over the past two days, culminating in a  4% drop today. This decline has also caused a slight downturn in the broader market due to HDFC's substantial influence on major indices,

 This report delves into the reasons behind this decline, could be HDFC's Q1 results and other contributing factors.

**Q1 Results Analysis:**
The primary driver behind HDFC's stock decline is its disappointing Q1 results, which fell short of market expectations. 

Below is a detailed breakdown of the key financial metrics and their impact:

1. **Deposits:**
Year-over-year (YoY) growth of 16.5% and a quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) growth of 0.08%. The minimal QoQ growth indicates stagnation, which has raised concerns among investors.

2. **CASA Ratio:**
A decrease of 190 basis points (bps) QoQ to 36%. This decline in the Current Account and Savings Account (CASA) ratio suggests that fewer low-cost deposits are coming in, potentially increasing the bank's cost of funds.

3. **Loan Book:**
YoY growth of 14.9%, but flat QoQ. The stagnation in the loan book growth is a red flag, considering that loans are a major revenue source for the bank.

4. **Net Interest Income:**
A modest increase of 1.09% QoQ. While positive, this growth is not substantial enough to offset other weaknesses.

5. **Loan Loss Provisions:**
An increase of 3.55% QoQ. Higher provisions indicate rising concerns about loan defaults.

6. **Net Income:**
A decline of 1.78% QoQ. This drop in net income has disappointed investors who expected better performance.

**Market Expectations and MSCI EM Index:**

The market had high expectations for HDFC, especially after its increased weightage in the MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) index. However, the Q1 results have not met these expectations, leading to a sharp correction in the stock price.

**Detailed Analysis of Key Metrics**

**Gross Advances:**
Gross advances refer to the total loans extended by the bank to its customers. A QoQ decline of 0.8% in gross advances is not that bad actually.  Given that loans are a significant revenue stream for HDFC, even a small decline can have a considerable impact, especially when market expectations are high due to the bank's increased weightage in the MSCI EM index.

**CASA Ratio:**
The CASA ratio, which measures the proportion of a bank's deposits that are in current and savings accounts, has decreased by 190 bps QoQ to 36%. This decline indicates that the bank is receiving fewer low-cost deposits, which are crucial as they lower the bank's overall cost of funds.

**CD Ratio:**
The credit-to-deposit (CD) ratio, which stands at 105%, suggests that HDFC lends out Rs 105 for every Rs 100 it receives in deposits. While this indicates a high utilization of deposits, it also means that future growth in advances might be constrained if deposit growth does not keep pace.

**Possible Reasons for Weak Q1 Results**

1. **Merger Impact:**
   After the merger, the combined entity might be dealing with a higher volume of pending loans and fewer deposits, affecting crucial ratios like CASA and CD. This imbalance can lead to weaker financial performance.

2. **RBI's Economic Policies:** ( *we are talking about banks performance and didn't incorporate RBI that doesn't seem fair* )

 The Reserve Bank of India's focus on managing economic concerns could mean that banks, including HDFC, are more focused on managing existing loans rather than extending new ones. Additionally, potential interest rate hikes by the RBI could further impact the bank's performance in the short term.

**Conclusion**
Despite the recent short-term challenges, HDFC Bank remains fundamentally strong. The current decline is likely a temporary fluctuation driven by unmet expectations of market.
 HDFC has a solid track record of overcoming challenges and delivering strong long-term performance. Investors should remain patient, as the bank's fundamentals suggest it will continue to be a solid performer in the long term. HDFC is the largest bank of India and the 8th largest bank in the world and it is the only Bank in top 10 of world. Having all this makes this a solid investment so eat a 5 Star and do nothing, leave it for long terms.

See I am not for or against any stock, my point is that you can make money from most of the stock if you can play them right. If you keep shitting on a stock just because everyone else does it, you might never try to find the opportunity to earn in that stock.

post,1eunmdp,Investing in India as a next growth powerhouse? ,bpbri911,"I just listened to a fascinating podcast about the macroeconomic trends in India. They have a growing and youthful population, and their infrastructure and energy consumption are also on the rise. It seems that quite a few investors are eyeing India for its potential growth. (source: The Bid: Is India the next global grothw powerhouse?).

Does anyone here have experience with the Indian market? Any advice or recommendations before I dive into. I have listed out some potential companies and there is an EFT (iShares MSCI India FTE run buy BlackRock).

I have losted out some potential stocks with chat GPT:
	1.	Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) - Reliance continues to be a dominant force in India’s energy, retail, and telecommunications sectors. With its massive investments in digital services and clean energy, Reliance is poised for long-term growth.
	2.	Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) - As one of the largest IT services companies in the world, TCS continues to benefit from the global demand for digital transformation services. Its strong financial performance and consistent growth make it a solid choice.
	3.	HDFC Bank - HDFC Bank is one of the most stable and well-performing banks in India. Its consistent focus on expanding its retail and digital banking services has contributed to its robust growth trajectory.
	4.	Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL) - Part of the Adani Group, this company is a leader in the renewable energy sector in India. With India’s increasing focus on green energy, AGEL is expected to continue its rapid growth.
	5.	Infosys - Another major player in the IT services sector, Infosys has a strong global presence and continues to innovate in areas such as cloud computing, AI, and digital services.
	6.	Bharti Airtel - As one of India’s largest telecommunications providers, Bharti Airtel is well-positioned to benefit from the country’s growing internet and mobile phone penetration, especially with the ongoing rollout of 5G services.
	7.	Larsen & Toubro (L&T) - L&T is a major engineering and construction company in India. Its diverse business portfolio, which includes infrastructure, energy, and defense, is expected to drive growth in the coming years

post,1gyxypj,How are you thinking about your portfolio given the outcome of the 2024 US Election?,DC_cyber,"As the new Trump administration takes office in 2025, we will all grapple with a rapidly evolving economic landscape. The anticipated policies promise significant shifts reminiscent of Hungary's economic transformation.   Please let me know if you agree or disagree with any of the picks below...

# Understanding the Policy Shifts

**1. Economic Nationalism and Protectionism**

The administration's ""America First"" agenda is expected to:

* **Increase Tariffs on Imports**: Tariffs could rise by 10-25%, mainly targeting Chinese goods. This move aims to protect domestic industries but may lead to higher consumer prices.
* **Promote Onshoring**: Incentives for companies to relocate manufacturing to the U.S. could include tax breaks and subsidies.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Beneficiaries**: Domestic manufacturers like **Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT)** and **3M Company (NYSE: MMM)** could see increased demand due to reduced competition from imports.
* **Potential Losers**: Companies reliant on imported materials or global supply chains like **Apple** may face higher production costs and supply-chain disruptions.

**2. Deregulation and Tax Cuts**

Anticipated measures include:

* **Corporate Tax Reductions**: Lowering the rate from 21% to 15% could significantly boost net earnings.
* **Deregulation Efforts**: Especially in energy and finance, rolling back regulations like Dodd-Frank could reshape industry operations.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Financial Sector Gains**: Banks like **JPMorgan Chase** and **Goldman Sachs** might experience increased profitability due to relaxed lending regulations and lower taxes.
* **Energy Sector Surge**: Traditional oil and gas companies like **Exxon Mobil Corporation** and **Chevron Corporation** could benefit from reduced environmental regulations and expanded drilling rights.

**3. Increased Government Intervention**

Potential actions:

* **Sector-Specific Policies**: Favoring industries aligned with national priorities, possibly leading to subsidies for sectors like defense and infrastructure.
* **Unpredictable Regulatory Changes**: Sudden policy shifts could affect long-term planning and investment.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Defense Contractors Advantage**: Companies like **Lockheed Martin** and **Northrop Grumman** may secure lucrative government contracts amid increased defense spending.
