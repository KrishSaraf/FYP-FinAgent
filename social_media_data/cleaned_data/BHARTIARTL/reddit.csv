post,1izl5si,Reserves & Surplus are big frauds in India,gagan1985,"If Reserves get 2-3% interest while same company paying 8-9% interest on 1/3rd reserves as borrowings. That result in Net cash outflow.

why borrow so much if you have so much ""Reserves & Surplus"" that is not employed in **Good way**. Employing Reserves & Surplus in effective way makes sens,e but not at 2-3% interest rate and borrowing on 3x of that.   
I am not against borrowing, it helps in taxes. However, I am against poor allocation of capital. Or, is there a big fraud there? If yes, then that will collapse pretty soon.

  
**Can somebody tell me why am I wrong?**

Let me give you examples,

  
All amounts in Crores

|Company|Reserves  |Other Income|Borrowings|Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|RELIANCE|812,687|17,607|357,525|23,875|
|ADANI|41,782|1,646|80,427|5,694|
|Asian Paints|17,928|623|2,516|228|
|TCS|101,133|4,091|9,046|795|
|Bharti Airtel|84,202|10,852|225,541|21,455|

  
Bharti Airtel is in shit load on debt but atleast earning well on reserves than borrowings.

Coming to the question, I think we may be missing out on some things, but what I know is, getting debt to fund their expansion plans and business is more easier, otherwise billionaires like Mukesh Ambani, Sunil Mittal, etc, won't be taking so much debt.

Also, just see the interest payment on those debt by these companies VS the profit they earn annually. I think that maybe making some sense also in paying debt rather than using reserves.

That is all I know and can say on this. Maybe some good in economics or accounts here in this subreddit can give more clear answer on this.",2025-02-28 04:00:03,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1izl5si/reserves_surplus_are_big_frauds_in_india/,IndianStockMarket

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

I have seen the Strike price 1400 with a premium of 17 rupees at the 4th week of last month for BhartiArtl call option. Now in the 1st week of this month the same 1400 Strike price has a premium of 79 rupees.  
My question is ,The premium for SP 1400 will increase or decrease  in the 3rd and 4th week of this month.i hope my question makes some sense :)

comment,1drur2d,,,,,,,lay9q87,Savings_Ambassador73,Let's deep dive into this ! Option price is made of 2 things 1st intrinsic value 2nd is extrinsic value ..here intrinsic value is the actually value of that particular strike price when the contract gets expired ! Suppose on the monthly expiry day of Airtel ..it closes at 1456 and you choose is 1400 ce strike price then that 1400 ce option will close at 56 rs . And extrinsic value is calculated on the basis of option greeks that is whole different science ..greeks are the only factor which makes price to change continuously! So yaha ki baat kre ! If us particular stock ka price expiry day pe 1470 pe close hota h aur apne 1400 ce Lia h to u will make 70 rs profit !,2024-06-30 08:20:12,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1drur2d/option_chain_doubt/,IndianStockMarket

Now, I have some doubts regarding my portfolio:

1. **Is my MF portfolio good?**

I started with 5 SIPs based on my research but kept adding more whenever I found something interesting. Recently, friends advised that having too many MF SIPs can be problematic. They mentioned that the investment amount shouldn't change, but the number of MFs should be fewer. I didn't fully understand this. Are they right? If so, why? Also, if I need to reduce the number of MFs, which SIPs should I keep and which should I let go?

2. **Should I invest less in SIPs and more in stocks?**

I'm 29, and my friends say my risk appetite is higher. However, I prefer long-term investments and don't have the time or expertise to buy/sell stocks regularly. Am I making a mistake by focusing more on SIPs? Should I allocate more to stocks?

3. **Should I consider an SWP?**

4. I have 10 lacs to invest now. Any suggestions on how to allocate this based on my current portfolio?

Sorry for the many questions, but I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!",2024-06-27 05:22:34,3.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1dpjl0b/seeking_advice_on_my_investment_portfolio/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1dpjl0b,,,,,,,lahef35,Individual_Zombie_85,"1. Yeah I think you have way too many MF's. You can reduce it to 4-5 funds max. Please check the overlap between the different funds. I don't think multiple ELSS Tax Saver funds are required. Just keep 1 from each category. The reason for not keeping multiple MF's is, different expense ratios can keep eating into your profits.
2. If you don't have time to analyse and buy/sell stocks, you can continue with your SIP, no problem in that. You mentioned that you are picking stocks based on your friend's suggestions, and that can go horribly wrong. It's your life and your financial goals, so you can take the call about which way you want to go. Nothing wrong with either.",2024-06-27 05:54:28,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1dpjl0b/seeking_advice_on_my_investment_portfolio/,IndianStockMarket

post,1k1ahgp,Trades breakdown✌️,nafi_najeeb,"I took an overnight position on BHARTIARTL yesterday because it has broke its all time high, daybefore yesterday and sustanined above that level for a day. Also there was quite a nice move to the upside near 3 pm yesterday. So i expected a break out move today and my risk was only 500 in this case.

As i expected it brokeout from that level.
Today market opening was lil confusing and tricky till afternoon soo i booked 650 profit.


And also in the case of AXISBANK. I had bullish view but i noticed some serious selling in axis bank at the beginning of market open so i book a small loss. But afternoon it moved upside 

And another trade was in BRIGADE ENT. I noticed some big buying in that stock and with my setup i took a trade. It moved in my favour(1.5x r/r) but i didnt booked profit expecting it to rally because market was in fire mode!! But end of the day also i noticed another big buying at the same level.and the move didnt happened yet. Expecting it to happen on monday. I will wait for my set up. Letsee

Anyway my netloss for today after tax and brockerage is -17

post,1hdc18e,Market swing today defied intraday momentum function on charts. Need guidance from experienced traders only. ,Status_Security_607,"I do swing intraday trades and so far I have not faced any losses even if the market was falling down like yesterday. But today the market momentum was so strong that even chart functions like intraday momentum and RSI failed to capture overbought and oversold positions during market timings. 

Here’s the thing, I earn profits by short selling stocks when they are overbought during intraday. For this I use RSI and intraday momentum. 

See the picture attached for Bharti Airtel stock at 12pm the stock was OVERSOLD @ ₹1657 and bearish sentiment formed. Short selling began, bearish candles formed. But even after short sell the price of stock at 12:35pm was ₹1662. Thereby, giving LOSS of ₹5/share in trade. 

Someone please Help me understand what am I missing here? 

How to avoid this in future?
Is there any other chart function i need to add in consideration?

UltraTech Cement is consolidating near its all-time high, with Bollinger Bands contracting—indicating a potential big move ahead. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is signaling a buy, and the stock is trading above the 20 EMA and 40 EMA, reflecting bullish momentum. Fresh OI additions at the 12,500 Call strike indicate bullish sentiment. This sets up a 500-point trading range, offering opportunities for breakout and momentum trades. Fresh OI additions at the 12500 call suggests that the call writers are shifting their position to 12500. This development potentially opens up 500 points upside based on the Open Interest data",2024-12-13 11:10:17,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hd9ytz/ultratech_cement_bullish_momentum_builds_near/,StockMarketIndia

Jefferies, a global brokerage firm, has released its 2025 market outlook, predicting a bullish Nifty target of 26,000, implying a potential 10% return for the year.  
Among its top nine stock picks for 2025, Bharti Airtel stands out as a key recommendation. Jefferies favors large-cap stocks like Bharti Airtel over smaller peers, highlighting its strategic importance in their well-balanced sectoral approach.

**Technical View**

Bharti Airtel has started trading above its 20-day and 40-day moving averages, indicating a breakout from its resistance levels. Additionally, the Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is signaling a buy, further supporting the bullish sentiment.  
The key question now is: Can Bharti Airtel sustain this breakout and continue its upward trajectory?

post,1f7sdp4,Nifty momentum top 10 - Week 1,SehgalK,"Hello all - I’m a professional buysider which means I invest thousands of crores of institutional money for a living. I’ve been doing this for a decade. Separately, of course, I have a personal equity portfolio as well — in that, I have been investing ~40% of my capital based on momentum factor for the past couple of years and that has beat the broader market indices by a decent margin. 

Beginning today, in this thread, I’ll post top 10 stocks from Nifty50 which are currently experiencing high momentum. I’ll update this list on a weekly basis. 

If I see interest in these lists, I’ll post high momentum stocks from small- and mid-caps as well. I have a couple of smallcases as well (freely available) that are also based on momentum tracking. These have given 79% and 20% returns in the past 14 months and 4 months, respectively.

post,1k1agwz,Trades breakdown✌️,nafi_najeeb,"I took an overnight position on BHARTIARTL yesterday because it has broke its all time high, daybefore yesterday and sustanined above that level for a day. Also there was quite a nice move to the upside near 3 pm yesterday. So i expected a break out move today and my risk was only 500 in this case.

As i expected it brokeout from that level.
Today market opening was lil confusing and tricky till afternoon soo i booked 650 profit.


And also in the case of AXISBANK. I had bullish view but i noticed some serious selling in axis bank at the beginning of market open so i book a small loss. But afternoon it moved upside 

And another trade was in BRIGADE ENT. I noticed some big buying in that stock and with my setup i took a trade. It moved in my favour(1.5x r/r) but i didnt booked profit expecting it to rally because market was in fire mode!! But end of the day also i noticed another big buying at the same level.and the move didnt happened yet. Expecting it to happen on monday. I will wait for my set up. Letsee

Anyway my netloss for today after tax and brockerage is -17

This surge was primarily driven by tariff hikes and a one-time gain of ₹75.46 billion during the quarter.

From a technical perspective, the stock is in an uptrend, trading above the 40-week EMA, and has successfully broken through its resistance level. The weekly RMI is signaling a new buy opportunity. However, some selling pressure has emerged in the second half of the session.

comment,1fbuedk,,,,,,,lm3dvmj,No_Engineering_7760,"All I see on Reddit is people buying naked options and hoping someone will give them a profitable exit. 

1. If you buying naked option make sure its for intraday only( though I don't advise that as well) 
2. If you want to take the trade over a weekend make it a spread so that it can be adjusted in case the trade goes against you. 
3. If you can not understand what I said in point number 2 then pls stop option trading and do equity first.

comment,1fbuedk,,,,,,,lm3u1uz,PositiveFun8654,"Kaam he aise kiye hain.   Never buy OTM call / put. NEVER.  If 13-14 days are left to expiry then never naked. Always spreads.  Before that you need to look at IV and IVR.  As thumb rule naked option buying should be ok but IV and IVR reading is best way to determine that.  When confused buy spreads.  Want to play safe? Buy spread.  Spread never hurts.  

Option trading requires you to be right on three things at same time - direction of move, time of move and volatility.  Hence spreads are better.  If you know / can predict these three factors with reasonable accuracy ONLY then think of naked option buying.  Naked option selling NEVER PERIOD.

Edit:  I don’t know what all analysis tools you use.  If you do not have payoff graph then I will strongly advice you to open trading account with Dhan.  They have options trader or something which comes with account.  Use that to calculate options payoff.  Using dhan for trading is your wish but this tool is free and excellent for payoffs etc.",2024-09-08 12:52:15,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1fbuedk/cooked_fried_or_burnt/,IndianStreetBets

Jefferies, a global brokerage firm, has released its 2025 market outlook, predicting a bullish Nifty target of 26,000, implying a potential 10% return for the year.  
Among its top nine stock picks for 2025, Bharti Airtel stands out as a key recommendation. Jefferies favors large-cap stocks like Bharti Airtel over smaller peers, highlighting its strategic importance in their well-balanced sectoral approach.

**Technical View**

Bharti Airtel has started trading above its 20-day and 40-day moving averages, indicating a breakout from its resistance levels. Additionally, the Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is signaling a buy, further supporting the bullish sentiment.  
The key question now is: Can Bharti Airtel sustain this breakout and continue its upward trajectory?",2024-12-13 08:29:31,1.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1hd7w7n/bharti_airtel_among_top_gainers_whats_driving/,IndianStreetBets

UltraTech Cement is consolidating near its all-time high, with Bollinger Bands contracting—indicating a potential big move ahead. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is signaling a buy, and the stock is trading above the 20 EMA and 40 EMA, reflecting bullish momentum. Fresh OI additions at the 12,500 Call strike indicate bullish sentiment. This sets up a 500-point trading range, offering opportunities for breakout and momentum trades. Fresh OI additions at the 12500 call suggests that the call writers are shifting their position to 12500.
