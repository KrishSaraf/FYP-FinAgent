Titan is currently at a crucial support level, showing signs of holding strong. Over the past two days, the stock opened with a gap-down but managed to close positively, indicating strong buying interest at this level.  
On the hourly timeframe, Titan is forming a divergence pattern and is trading near the 40-hour EMA. If it breaks above the 40-hour EMA and the daily RMI gives a buy signal, Titan could move upward, with the 40-day EMA acting as the next resistance.",2025-02-25 11:47:41,6.0,6.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ixt4x9/can_titan_sustain_its_support_and_move_higher/,IndianStockMarket

post,1g0dnow,Titan,st_1110,"Hey all
I had bought 20 shares of Titan @3426 so around 68k invested in this last year. Since then it has barely given me 1-2% profit. 
This is lesser than even a fd. 

Now, I was planning to keep this stock for atleast 3-4 years but at this pace unable to understand if it's even a good stock option anymore.

I thought titan was a very strong company with it's business and thought it still has the potential to give atleast 30-40% return in next 3-4 years but now I am doubtful of this. 

Since I am new to investing ( started last year) would like to know the opinion here about this stock and should I hold it? What the future of this company and it's stock seems like?

post,1gnw798,"Titan vs Trent: Contrasting Approaches to Lab-Grown Diamonds Within the Tata Group"" - clear and comprehensive",Ghoshpresso,"Despite the growing global interest in lab-grown diamonds, Titan remains cautious about entering this market in India.

* **Limited Customer Demand**: Titan, a major player in the Indian jewelry market, hasn't seen much interest in lab-grown diamonds. Their MD, C.K. Venkataraman, notes that customers across their brands like Tanishq and CaratLane prefer natural diamonds. The focus is on authenticity rather than lab-grown options.
* **Cultural Differences**: Unlike the US, where Hollywood glamorizes big diamonds, Indian culture doesn't emphasize large stones. This cultural difference affects demand, with Indian women not typically seeking large diamonds.
* **Brand Value and Trust**: Tanishq, Titan's flagship brand, is known for natural diamonds. Entering the lab-grown market could dilute this reputation. Plus, Indian consumers are skeptical about the sustainability claims of lab-grown diamonds, given their energy-intensive production.
* **Market Volatility**: The US lab-grown diamond market has seen rapid growth but also instability, leading to price drops. Titan's investment in Clean Origins, a US-based lab-grown diamond company, resulted in losses, making them cautious about similar ventures in India.
* **Focus on Existing Strengths**: Titan sees growth potential in the natural diamond market in India. They're expanding into new cities and strengthening their existing market presence, leveraging their established trust and brand value.
* **Strategic Considerations**: While Titan acknowledges the potential of lab-grown diamonds, they're evaluating their strategy carefully. Factors like Indian jewelry designs, which often use smaller diamonds, and the perception of lab-grown diamonds as a store of value amid falling prices, are being considered. Titan plans to reveal their strategy when ready.

Interestingly, another Tata Group company, Trent, has launched lab-grown diamonds under its Westside brand, suggesting the group is exploring this market through different channels. However, Titan remains focused on natural diamonds, aligning with their understanding of the Indian market and brand strategy.

What do you think, fellow redditors? Do you see a future for lab-grown diamonds in India, or is Titan right to focus on natural diamonds? Share your thoughts!",2024-11-10 08:31:42,7.0,7.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gnw798/titan_vs_trent_contrasting_approaches_to_labgrown/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1gnw798,,,,,,,lwdw1kj,SNN2,"In my view, lab-grown diamonds have made diamonds a commodity and people in the mass market will stop assigning value to stones as they understand that there is no more scarcity of the resource thus it is not rare thus it is not precious.

So natural stones will move to larger carats and be used only in extremely expensive settings for the elite.

Diamonds will become an industrial commodity more so than it is today, and become somewhat like or even lower than silver.

Gold will be regarded more favorably as it will still remain a store of value for central banks and lab-grown gold is not possible yet.

From anecdotal evidence of friends who own jewelry businesses, there is no stigma attached to lab grown diamonds and many customers consider it the smarter choice as even experienced gemologists can’t tell the difference. The Indian customer is one of the most value-conscious customer segments in the world.",2024-11-10 08:45:23,6.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gnw798/titan_vs_trent_contrasting_approaches_to_labgrown/,IndianStockMarket

Trent on the other hand serves young and aspirational customer base (sub 35, and sub 20 lpa salary)

My 2 cents - in the long run lab diamonds will become mainstream in India.

1. Indian women value gold more than diamond

2. Value of jewellery will be ""stored"" in gold and not ""stone""

3. Lab diamond in (gold) jewellery will just be seen as a substitute to precious stones and crystals etc.

4. Sub 5,000 jewellery will become dominant with lab diamond",2024-11-10 09:31:13,5.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gnw798/titan_vs_trent_contrasting_approaches_to_labgrown/,IndianStockMarket

post,1gbu0xz,The real reason behind the fall,JustDrop007,"Companies growing at 5% should not be valued at a 30 price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. Companies growing at 10% should not be valued at a 50 PE ratio. Companies that grow by 15-20% should not be expected to provide 100% returns.


This applies to companies like Nestlé, HUL, VBL, Siemens, ABB, Maruti, Mahindra, Bajaj Auto, Titan, and some PSUs like BHEL and Sun Pharma. These companies appear to be overvalued. 


While there may be growth in the Indian economy, it is unrealistic to expect this growth to materialize overnight.

post,1efm1ll,What are your most successful stock picks? Share your proudest portfolio positions!,the29devil,"Let’s celebrate our wins and learn from each other! I have some winners that I am really proud of selecting. I’m curious to know about the stock picks in your portfolio that have done well and that you’re most proud of. Here are two of mine:



KPIT Technologies: Over 500% gains! 🚀

Reason 1: KPIT is a leader in automotive software, and with the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles, I saw massive growth potential.

Reason 2: Their consistent innovation and strategic partnerships with major automotive players gave me confidence in their long-term success.

Titan Company: Bought first in 2021. Averaging up at every 10% dip, currently at 60% gain. 💎

Reason 1: Titan’s strong brand presence and diverse product portfolio, especially in jewelry and watches, made it a solid choice.

Reason 2: Their ability to adapt to market trends and consumer preferences has kept them ahead of the competition.



Would love to see your proudest positions and the reasons behind your choices. Let’s inspire and learn from each other! 📈",2024-07-30 06:04:40,133.0,157.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1efm1ll/what_are_your_most_successful_stock_picks_share/,IndianStockMarket

Now for the one's we like. I personally have problem in one way or another with almost all the influencers who talk about finance in as I might not agree with some of there philosophies, However there are still some diamonds in the dust and here are mine -

1.  Parimal Ade/Yadnya Investment Academy - Good fundamental stock analysis. A bit pushy of there own products but nothing over the top. They talk about market trends but not in a ""buy this that"" way but more like news.
2.  SOIC - Great analysis framework and they perform actual deep dives into fundamentals of the companies. He tends to go with trends (the trends that are almost about to burst) a lot like the pharma, chemical, semiconductor wave but he shares all the details of the company which paints us a whole picture.
3. Akshat Shrivastava - Many people named him in the worst category but I personally don't mind him much. He has studied from INSEAD, puts proper disclaimer before any stock analysis (though I find the stock names pretty useless) and generally gives a decent macro picture. Terrible thumbnails & captions though.
4. LLA - they are **the GOAT** for me. Taught me so much about my taxes, insurances and money in general. No pedaling of stocks or insurances. Kudos to them!

 I know I did not sound appreciative of them because I think most of them comes with there own caveats.

post,1e1bl3b,Never sell you winners.,lotus_eater_rat,"I moved to Pune in 2018 and lived near the Persistent System office. I used to pass through their building, and It may sound funny but one of the reasons to check the company was because I liked their office names. I started investing in the PPFAS mutual fund and the persistent system was one of the top holdings. I bought shares worth 45K in 2018. Sold 1/3rd in 2021 and again in 2022 to get advantage of 1 lakh LTCG tax-expectation. Also bought TATA elixir during the same period and sold it when it became 2X.

I did make some money but after seeing the further growth I promised myself that I would never sell  
unless there is something seriously wrong with the companies I am holding. Have not sold a single stock since March 2022, Remaining 15k of the persistent system is now 2.60 lakhs (17X) in 6 years. I have HDFC Bank, ITC, Persistent System, Arman Finance, Maruti, Titan, ICICI Bank, TCS, and NMDC in my portfolio.

I know my XIRR (22%) may not be impressive in today’s scenario but I would suggest don’t sell your  
winner for a small gain. If you are holding good companies, there is potential it could be 25X or 50X in the long term. Also, think what difference it will make to your wealth if u even make 5k in 6 months on a 10k investment. It will surely make a difference if u make 2.5 lakh from 10k.

post,1i40mpb,Kalyan jewellers - a overhated but interesting stock,Snoo37787,"Before I continue I will interate I have this stock from 100 levels, I know most of you will downvote it mostly and it's fine but I had to make sure that retailers are not getting screwed over by rumours and fake news 

Over the past month kalyan has gone down 35% from its peak , many are calling it names pump and dump and what not, even abusing motilal oswal who got the stock at 350 (an entry which according to me will never come again) 

The allegations on the management are quite frankly absurd and nonsense, none of it has any proof nor has any sebi investigation been triggered 


Now you may say ""you are biased cause you hold it"" yes I am , but I also did my own DD on the stock before I entered it even at 100 levels. When Kalyan jewellers did it's ipo back in 2021 they made 125 crores from ofs , yes 125 crores . They made no money from this stock, they instead purchased more on leverage at 530, now go try doing this for the latest stocks most of the ipo is pure ofs, offloading their garbage on retail and retail eating it, find me such a quality management which puts their money where their mouth is, I will wait


Now onto the allegations -

1) kalyan jewellers paid mutual funds to buy their shares in the fund, why would a company pay fund managers to buy their company when it's growing at twice the pace of the rest of the industry small or big in size? That too in a 80k crores company, sebi isn't so dumb man please let's get that out of the way

2) IT raid , ED raid, if such raids happen to a business family of their level u will see it on news, they were the 30th richest in india just 2 weeks ago and they have many more unlisted business which makes them a very prominent family of south india, u will see it in news but guess what? U didn't cause it is false

3) if the fund manager bribery was not fluff this one certainly tops the list , apparently they bribed ED to avoid arrest , I have heard better stories from drunk beggars

4) inventory overvaluation, for such a company where their inventory is almost the size of titan there is a huge huge audit process with multiple checks and balances , independent as well, u can't just overvalued ur inventory at that scale, it's a national scandal and it will cause chaos 😂 let's be realistic, kalyan jewellers is one of the top 5 gold importers into the country last year, that's the level at which they deal, inventory overvaluation is absurd at so many levels in this case

5) promotors got FIR, if any such cases are running again it will be all over the news ,it needs to be declared to stock exchange 


The overall fall seems to be the product of both the stock being a tad bit overvalued from the top (around 15-20%) along with unfounded rumour mongering, the only ones that made money here are the bears who had a short position in this stock from the very beginning, there was unusual oi in the short side of this stock from December itself , I track it so I noticed it, they refused to sell their shorts even when the stock hit ath, at the time didn't make sense to me , I mean 40% growth update and yet who has the balls to short like that, now it all adds up, they always planned to wait for the promotors trading window to close before they attacked the stock and they chose then business update day to buy cheap shorts as well from open market 


About corporate governance of kalyan have no doubt it's first class
The chairman of the board is the former CAG of india vinod rai, he was the one who exposed the 2G scam of the ruling government without being scared of the PMO , he won't be involved or allowing such things to happen under him, it's all a lot of rumours to get cheap stocks by the institutes according to me

It's a well elaborated short attack according to me , because 2 weeks are over sebi has neither sent any notice to the company nor has there been any news of tax evasion or promotor arrest



This also reminds me of a similar attack same time last year and motilal was a top holder in this stock as well, stock market participants may have short term memory but the charts don't forget, polycab
Polycab had a lot of allegations (which was true considering there was real news as well) stock fell 30% and then went on to give 75% returns in a yearly basis 
I do not believe motilal will invest 10% aum in a company based on a bribe and I do not believe motilal will invest 10% aum without proper check on CG
Now the rest readers can take it as it may
I haven't sold a single share in this fall, I don't intend to, I see the stock hitting 1500 in 2 years considering it's forward pe for next year is just 40. Even taking normal or expansion what I said is very fair value for it

I remain long and bullish on the stock, those who say ""don't compare it to titan"" just check the data , data doesn't lie , titan is slipping , they have 8% market share of organised play and kalyan has 7, they had just 4 , just 2 years ago, one is claiming they will hit 10 from the past 3 years one will hit it in a year without needing to make tall claims
Data doesn't lie nor does factual information,

post,1k1irvy,"Gold Demand is Surging, Here's Why I'm Bullish Long-Term",Legitimate-One-2565,"Gold is quietly having a massive moment. With central banks across the world dumping US bonds and piling into gold due to tariff tensions, geopolitical risks, and weakening trust in the dollar, demand is skyrocketing.

India, being one of the largest consumers of gold, stands to benefit both as a market and through smart investing. Physical gold is being picked up not just for tradition, but now also as a hedge. SGBs were a good route but they’ve been stopped for now, and physical gold is taxed only 3% on buying. Gold loans are also gaining traction with rates around 11%, which makes more sense than selling and triggering a 20%+ capital gains tax.

Also, don’t ignore how gold performs in uncertain times. It’s historically a safe haven when currencies get volatile, bond markets get shaky, and inflation expectations rise.

My take: Gold will remain strong as long as the de dollarisation trend continues. Countries are stacking gold for a reason and I’m staying long.

Would love to know, are you guys holding physical, ETFs like GoldBees, or looking at gold-related stocks like Titan, Kalyan, or Manappuram?",2025-04-17 17:38:26,60.0,48.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1k1irvy/gold_demand_is_surging_heres_why_im_bullish/,IndianStockMarket

comment,1k1irvy,,,,,,,mnmkrob,Legitimate-One-2565,"Yeah I get that and you're right about the alternatives. ETFs, MFs, even digital gold all do track gold prices closely.

post,1ds2yxv,Daddy Portfolio ,Minimum-Historian899,"Heard this term ""Daddy Portfolio"" from my cousin - who works in an investment bank. 

Our father or grandfather - bought shares and they never touched them for a decade at least 

Lot of them turned it into a very good investment.

On the other side - our generation is doing mutual funds, intra day trading, long term, medium term, short term investment, option trading, crypto - and still in losses 

My dad's portfolio is really impressive... He is retired... But kept investing at least couple of lacs every year... No matter what the market situation is... He kept getting dividends,Bonus, split shares... Major chunk of his portfolio 

1) Asian Paints 
2) Titan 
3) Persistent 
4) Kotak Bank 
5) HAL 


He is almost 455% up on his portfolio at the moment ...  Never allows me see details. Tells me -  Your generation will never understand value of time and patience 

Anyone here with impressive and profitable Daddy Portfolio???

comment,1ds2yxv,,,,,,,laznhse,Professor_Moraiarkar,"You really are financially naive if you are mentioning mutual funds, long term investments AND options, crypto is the same sentence, thinking that all these make losses. 

Granted long term buy and hold strategy for many stocks have led to multibagger returns. But one has to understand that people did not expect such returns when they invested in these stocks. Its the gradual accumulation and further compounding of the stock value which leads to such returns. Your father's 455% returns are absolute in nature. Ask him for ""CAGR"" returns and then you will see the difference. The CAGR returns would be in order of 15 to 25% in most cases over the long term for stocks.

Now, explore the web and check the returns of the mutual funds which are active for past 15 to 25 years. You will find similar returns in them too.

The most important factor is to invest in mutual funds or stocks with perseverence and discipline irrespective of the short term volatility. Mutual funds go one step further thst since they have a diversified basket of stocks, laggards like YES bank dont have considerable effect on the overall fund performance.",2024-06-30 15:34:55,43.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ds2yxv/daddy_portfolio/,IndianStockMarket

But, you are looking at the current company, you aren't looking at it from the lens of a Investor who bought it at say 1990 or 2000's. Stock price growth is dependent on 2 things: 1) pe re-rating 2) profit growth. Most of the gains are made because of 1&2. Not when there is only second part because it's hard for a ""fundamentally good"" company to squeeze more margins or grow in a industry where its already dominant.

post,1fqdl1b,"Rev/iew my port/folio please, 28 , No background of investment, Self Made so far, Goal - 1cr before 30 ",rohit9967,"Hi Reddit Family,

A bit of context about myself:

I come from a humble background, without any financial inheritance or prior knowledge of investing. I’ve worked hard to support my family and am currently responsible for my parents and others close to me. At 28, Single and working full-time, I started investing around 2-3 years ago with no prior experience, learning through Reddit, YouTube, and books.

My focus is on long-term growth, with a goal of reaching 1cr before I turn 30. Achieving this would provide me with a sense of financial security and peace of mind.

Treat me someone who is eager to learn but lacking good network or friends to guide me through these decisions. Your advice would mean a lot to me.

Current status of my monthly investment :

* Nifty 50 SIP - Monthly (20k) 
* Nifty next 50 SIP - Monthly (20k) 
* Additional stocks investment - (10k)

Specifically, I would appreciate your thou/ghts on the following:

1. How do you eval/uate my current port/folio, and what improvements could I make?
2. What actions or strategies should I focus on to potentially reach 1cr before 30? Additionally, how much more investment would be necessary to achieve that goal, currently investing around \~50/month?
3. I will be receiving a bonus of approximately 8L next month, what would be the best strategy to invest it wisely?

I suggest you avoid chasing higher returns by taking unnecessary risks, like investing in penny stocks or derivatives for short-term gains. These can lead to significant losses over time. Instead, focus on consistently growing your capital. Regular investments in mutual funds, combined with a little exposure to stocks (if you understand them), can be a more sustainable way to create wealth.

post,1i3afxq,Seeking insights on Kalyan Jewellers: Hold or exit strategy? ,Horizon-Cascade,"I recently invested in Kalyan Jewellers, expecting strong performance due to the Indian wedding season, which typically drives gold and jewelry sales. My decision was based on their extensive retail presence, the cultural demand for gold, and Kalyan’s reputation as a trusted brand.

However, the stock has been falling significantly, making me question whether this is just short-term volatility or a sign of deeper issues like weak fundamentals, intense competition, or operational challenges.

For those familiar with this stock or the jewelry industry, is there reason to believe a recovery is likely, or would it be better to cut my losses now? Any insights or analysis would be greatly appreciated!

34YO Male. Professional Income. 

Started post-Covid. But a substantial sum out of this has been invested in the last 3-4 months.

Point is to review the portfolio / allocation etc. as it stands today - for the future. That is why I have provided current value of holdings (though invested sum can be calculated pretty easily). Past gains (especially %ages) are indicative of pretty much nothing as I have been irregular in buying and accumulating over the said period.

Would love everyone's views and opinions. 

PS - discerning folks on here will be able to see Saurabh Mukherjea's influence but even more discerning (and sympathethic) folks will be able to see I am reducing the said influence now 😄

LATE (AND LONG) EDIT - As rightly said in some replies, MF portfolio has some unnecessary over-complication. I'm slowly moving my inv from Axis ELSS to PP ELSS (as and when 3 year limit ends), so count one less fund. The two PP funds again I count as basically one big Flexi fund, so that's again one less fund. Small caps I don't feel comfortable with just one fund, and the universe is large enough to accommodate two funds. 
So basically-
•one Largecap (Niftybees) 
•one Flexicap (2 PPs + whatever's left of Axis)
•one Large & Mid
•one Midcap
•two Smallcaps
•one USA (where in fact if someone can suggest which should I actually invest in, anyway PP Flexi can't invest more in the US stocks).

post,1jmgw56,Large-Cap Stocks (Nifty50): Technical Insights as We Wrap Up FY 2024-25,priteshpalan,"As we approach the end of the financial year, I took a look at the charts of some large-cap stocks (Nifty50). Sharing my observations below—not as calls to buy or sell, but as insights based on price action. Even after 20+ years of studying charts, I still consider myself a learner, and I believe the market always has something new to teach.

# Stock Observations:

🔹 **TATAMOTORS** – Weak unless it crosses & closes above **725**. Sell on rise otherwise.

🔹 **TCS** – Broken previous weekly low; break below 3457 with volume it could fall to **2744**.

post,1dbsctu,WHEN TO SELL A STOCK ⁉️,Subject-Tea9236,"WHEN TO SELL A STOCK ⁉️

In our opinion, the most difficult skill in Investing is NOT the ability to find a great stock.

It is to know WHEN to sell the stock. 

We keep reading - if you had invested money in XYZ stock in 2010, you would have made so much wealth. 💭

But what happens if you remove the benefit of hindsight. 🤔

Take Bajaj Finance for example. The stock was available at Rs 7 (adjusted for bonuses / splits) in 2009. Yes, you read that right! 🤑

Now assume someone bought it at 7. Do you think they would have held on till today?

The investor would have seen the price go to 20, then 50, 100, 1000, 3000, 7000. 

Also a decline from 4800 to 1800 in 2020. 🤯

At what point do you think the investor would have had enough? 

Sitting tight on a stock is easier said than done. Behavioral biases would not allow for it. 

Add to that survivorship bias. We keep talking about Infosys, HDFC Bank, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Titan. ✨

But for each of these, there is a Unitech, Punj Lloyd, Idea, Suzlon, Yes Bank, which promised gold but went to dust. 🤡

And others which seemingly were great but stopped going up at one point. Bata, HDFC Bank, Nerolac, IndusInd Bank, Biocon, PVR Inox, Ramco Cement are some of the names that have given < 5% CAGR return over the past 5 years 

How does one know when the stock has done enough. 🤷🏻‍♂️

So to us, the toughest skill in investing is to know when to sell a stock. Something that even we are still trying to understand and learn. 

We can learn a lot of concepts to identify great companies. But only those who can master when to sell or hold a stock can really create a process around creating wealth. 💰

You manage your portfolio when you can be actively involved in it and even then, EVEN THEN, sustainably beating the index is statistically next to impossible. Experiened educated fund managers haven't been able to do it, so you can't too. Don't get caught up in the noise of the bull market and park your money in an index fund. Learn learn learn. Make mistakes. Make more mistakes. Experience a bear market. Only then pick stocks and invest.

post,1dw2kvl,Kotak predicts a bleak future for Oil & Gas stocks. What's your take on it?,sandymartin07,"Recently, Kotak Institutional Equities suggested a 'Sell' rating on oil & gas stocks like IOC, BPCL, HPCL, GAIL, Oil India, and Petronet LNG, citing diminishing prospects of future growth beyond a limit. What do you make of it? I myself have fair exposure to some of these stocks and believe the energy & power sector isn't going to die out soon. Recently, they also had similar verdicts about Titan and Lupin, and the shares saw substantial movement the next day.

What is your opinion? Doesn't it look like these firms try to influence the market in some way?

post,1e8p9jp,EID Parry - an agriculture titan disguised as a sugar business [OpenSourceInvestor],super_compound,"EID Parry is like that grand old tree in your backyard—rooted deep in history, yet constantly sprouting new branches. It was founded 182 years ago, and if we calculate its lifespan using the [Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect), it will still be around in 2206.

This isn’t just any sugar business; it’s an agricultural titan in disguise, churning out everything from your morning sugar to spirulina, fertilizers and biofuels. So, grab your favourite [Mithai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweets_from_the_Indian_subcontinent), and let’s dive in!

6. Conclusion & sources

# Company overview & business model

EID Parry is part of the [Murugappa group](https://mysuccessproject.in/murugappa-group-explore-the-120-years-legacy/), one of the oldest business groups in India with 28+ businesses and a long history of fiduciary responsibility.

* Parry is the largest sugar manufacturer in South India. It started in 1842, when it opened the country’s first ever sugar plant at Nellikuppam, Tamil Nadu
* 30% of the sugar output is sold under the Parry brand, while 70% is sold in bulk.
   * The management team have indicated that they are planning to “move up the value chain”, with more focus on their branded line of sugar and nutraceuticals (spirulina , palmetto etc.).
   * The Indian government curbed [sugar exports in 2023](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/india-extends-curbs-sugar-exports-calm-domestic-prices-2023-10-18/), in order to control domestic sugar prices
   * To combat the sugar business's cyclicality, Parry has also significantly invested in distillery capacity, aligning with the Indian government's plan for increased domestic energy supply.
* Their branded sugar and FMCG business (27% of their revenue) is scaling rapidly, with the number of distribution outlets increasing from 20k in 2021 to 110k currently
* Apart from this, they also have a power generation and sugar refinery businesses, both of which have struggled to maintain profitability. These two business have depressed the margins over the last five years, which were around 1% on average.
* Even if loss-making units break even, margins would only increase to a razor-thin 2-3%, reflecting the commoditized nature of the sugar industry.

# Holding company structure

The Murugappa group took over EID Parry in 1981 and now own 38.3% of business. EID Parry, in turn, owns 56% of Coromandel International, which it had co-founded in the 1960s.

* Coromandel is the largest private phosphatic fertiliser manufacturer, and 2nd largest overall. The company enjoys 60% market share in the ‘Rice Bowl’ regions of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana
* Around half of Coromandel’s sales come from exports, where they see significant headroom for growth
* [IFFCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Farmers_Fertiliser_Cooperative), which is a Fertiliser Cooperative, is the largest fertilizer producer in India, with roughly twice the revenues of Coromandel. Coromandel has been gaining market share, with revenues growing \~11% CAGR since 2019, while IFFCOs sales have remained flat

# Balance sheet and capital allocation

* EID Parry had significant debt before 2020 but has since paid down a majority, leading to a fortress-like balance sheet and net cash of ₹23 billion (₹2300 crore) as of March 2024
* This gives them flexibility to invest in sugar-adjacent businesses (like distillery & nutraceuticals) and buy depressed assets during market downturns.
* Capital allocation has been hit-and-miss, with some of their ventures like Coromandel and the sugar distillery investments generating high ROCE , while other ones like the refinery have had very poor returns.
   * Overall , ROCE has been exceptional, averaging 26% since 2017
   * The management has expressed interest in further inorganic expansion in the FMCG space, but they have been pretty prudent so fair in sizing their capital investments, while maintaining a pristine balance sheet
   * Parry have also reduced their Coromandel stake from 60%+ to 56% currently. But don’t seem to have any plans to further trim their position.
* They haven’t fully reinvested their earnings. So, they do pay out dividends and have built up a cash position. An approximate capital deployment break-down over the last few years:
   * 50% re-invested into CAPEX
   * 30% paid out in dividend
   * 20% going to debt repayment or cash reserves

# Valuation

Many of the previous valuations I’ve read online seem to take a comparative valuation approach with a “Hold-Co discount” added on top. However, I chose to employ a discounted cash flow analysis, assuming the earnings of Coromandel will flow through to EID Parry shareholders eventually, either via dividends or incremental equity ownership.

Warren Buffett follows a similiar approach, by using “[look-though earnings](https://mastersinvest.com/newblog/2017/2/19/the-buffett-series-focus-on-the-earnings)” to value Berkshire Hathaway and other holding companies. Subsidiaries should only pay dividends if they cannot re-invest capital in their business at a high hurdle rate.

My estimates for value per share are given below. The full assumptions can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lm1JZtfuQudOFddkLIAPrMp7RLtx5_Zj/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114836972199643253007&rtpof=true&sd=true). 

[Value per share](https://imgur.com/lZDYxbz)

* Bear:  **₹645**
* Base: **₹911**
* Bull: **₹1,267**

Notes:

* The Coromandel stake represents \~70% of EID Parry’s value per share, so it forms a core part of the investment thesis. At current prices, you are essentially getting the sugar business and assets for “free”, as the Coromandel stake and net cash are worth ₹755
* If I valued the Coromandel stake at their current market price instead of using a discounted cash flow method, EID’s 56% ownership of Coromandel equals ₹1112 per share (after subtracting 25% in taxes) - 20% higher than my bull case estimate of ₹914. The markets seem to be valuing Coromandel with double-digit growth expectations for the next decade.

I had initially bought EID Parry in March 2022 and added to my position subsequently, so my average cost is ₹508 (much lower than current levels). The stock now looks close to fairly valued, with the gap between price and value narrowing significantly since the beginning of 2024. The stock currently represents 10% of my India portfolio - I plan to hold it for the next several years (or ideally forever).

[PPFAS](https://amc.ppfas.com/), a mutual fund I follow, has also invested in EID Parry since January 2024. However, it currently represents a small portion (0.2%) of their flexi-cap fund. They appear to have stopped adding to their position since February 2024, when the share price was around ₹600.

# Future growth potential

The current stock price seems fairly valued, but provides some free “call options” that I haven’t consider yet in the valuation:

* EID Parry
   * Indian sugar consumption could grow significantly: Indian per-capita consumption is around [22kg per year](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sugar-projections-consumption-per-capita_5jrzxx43xv37.pdf), while developed countries are at [36kg per year](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sugar-projections-consumption-per-capita_5jrzxx43xv37.pdf).
   * The Indian government drops the sugar export ban, leading to higher sugar realization prices
   * The Indian government ramps up the Ethanol blending program to reduce reliance on energy imports (similiar to [Brazil](https://www.energy-observer.org/resources/bioethnaol-brazilian-success-story))
   * FMCG grows to become a significant part of the business (similiar to [ITC](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/itcs-fmcg-business-set-to-touch-4-billion-mark/articleshow/111352796.cms)’s successful scale-up)
   * The freehold land bank owned by EID Parry, which they estimate to be valued at ₹394 Cr (or ₹22 per share of EID Parry)
* Coromandel could significantly ramp up export volumes: their current capacity is 4.5MMT (million metric ton), while the largest global crop nutrient manufacturers are close to [20\~30MMT](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1266558/plant-capacity-largest-fertilizer-manufacturers-worldwide/)

# Risks

* EID Parry
   * Global sugar prices plummet lower than EID’s production costs, leading to under-utilization and losses
   * The Indian government sets the MSP (minimum support price) for sugar purchases from farmers and could end up squeezing EID’s sugar margins.
   * Poor monsoons or pest related issues in South India, leading to lower sugar cane yields
* Coromandel faces significant litigation risks related to toxic chemical handling. The most recent example was a [gas leak at Ennore on Dec 2023](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chennai/ennore-gas-leak-tamil-nadu-govt-panel-coromandel-pay-penalty-9144811/), which resulted in a fine of ₹6 Cr.

# Conclusion

EID Parry appears to be well positioned, both on the production and consumption side of India’s agriculture food chain.

I don't want to affect you're decision, i just went back to check it's fundamentals as you stated you want to change to a company with good fundamentals, ROE is 49.4% , Tata motors book value is ₹275 ish , 10 year averages of both PB AND PE are 4 and 10 , company gives out good dividends and its FV is 2.

post,1ixusnk,The Indian Stock Market Is on the Edge of Total Collapse - Long Post,shameless_steel,"The Indian stock market is not merely faltering—it is hurtling toward an inevitable abyss, and those who fail to see it are either deluded or willfully blind. I have watched markets bend and break for decades, and the signs here are unmistakable: a speculative edifice teetering on a foundation of hubris, devoid of substance. The Nifty clings feebly to 22,500, and over ₹45 lakh crore has evaporated from the market in 2025 alone. This is not a correction; it is the prelude to a reckoning.

India’s economic narrative has long been a triumph of optimism over reality. The nation boasts no discernible edge in productivity or innovation—merely a reliance on borrowed momentum and cheap labor dressed up as competitive advantage. Corporate earnings among the Nifty 50, the supposed titans of this economy, are stagnating at levels unseen in half a decade—sales creeping up by a pitiful 5%, profits effectively flat. Yet the market trades at a delusional 24x earnings, as if fairy tales of perpetual growth can defy arithmetic. This is not resilience; it is recklessness.

The global tide is turning, and India is woefully unprepared. The United States teeters on the brink of recession, its shadow darkening every emerging market. Trump’s tariff saber-rattling threatens to gut India’s export-driven sectors—IT and pharmaceuticals, face annihilation. Foreign institutional investors have already scented the rot, withdrawing ₹2 lakh crore since October 2024, redirecting capital to China’s more disciplined ascent. India’s market capitalization has hemorrhaged $1 trillion, and the exodus is accelerating. Midcaps and smallcaps, inflated beyond reason, shed 3-4% in a day—portents of a bubble’s violent end.

The Reserve Bank of India is a bystander, its hands tied by a rupee in freefall and inflation rising like a specter from the grave. Oil prices, stoked by Middle Eastern turmoil, will only tighten the noose. Domestically, the picture is bleaker still. Non-performing assets haunt the banking sector anew, liquidity is a mirage, and the government peddles populist distractions while the real economy erodes. India’s much-vaunted demographic dividend? A myth—a workforce lacking the skills or infrastructure to compete in a world that rewards precision, not population.

India’s software and manufacturing exports, long propped up by low-cost labor and rote outsourcing, face an existential threat from artificial intelligence. The IT sector, a $200 billion crutch built on coding drones and call centers, is now redundant—AI systems can churn out code, debug, and automate workflows at a fraction of the cost, slashing demand for India’s legion of middling programmers. Manufacturing, already a feeble 17% of GDP, is no safer; AI-driven robotics and smart factories in rival nations like China and Vietnam outpace India’s outdated plants, rendering its cheap hands obsolete. Lacking innovation to pivot, India’s export engine is poised to stall—another edge lost to machines it neither owns nor understands.

Let us dispense with illusions: India’s edge is an illusion sustained by speculative froth, not innovation. Its productivity lags global peers—manufacturing languishes at 17% of GDP, a figure unchanged in decades, while competitors like Vietnam and Indonesia leap ahead. The startup ecosystem, heralded as a savior, churns out copycat apps and overvalued unicorns, not breakthroughs. This is not a nation forging the future; it is one coasting on fumes, betting on sentiment rather than substance.

The collapse is coming, and it will be merciless. The ₹13.95 lakh crore lost in the Yes Bank debacle of 2020 will seem trivial when this unravels—market circuits will trip, panic will reign, and the retail investor, lured by tales of endless rallies, will be left with ashes. I have seen this script before: over-leveraged hope meets unforgiving reality. My advice is simple—exit now. Liquidate your positions, secure your capital, and watch from a distance as the inevitable unfolds. India’s markets are not a phoenix; they are a pyre awaiting ignition.

Yours in sober observation,

post,1e1bldn,Never sell your winners.,lotus_eater_rat,"I moved to Pune in 2018 and lived near the Persistent System office. I used to pass through their building, and It may sound funny but one of the reasons to check the company was because I liked their office names. I started investing in the PPFAS mutual fund and the persistent system was one of the top holdings. I bought shares worth 45K in 2018. Sold 1/3rd in 2021 and again in 2022 to get advantage of 1 lakh LTCG tax-expectation. Also bought TATA elixir during the same period and sold it when it became 2X.

I did make some money but after seeing the further growth I promised myself that I would never sell  
unless there is something seriously wrong with the companies I am holding. Have not sold a single stock since March 2022, Remaining 15k of the persistent system is now 2.60 lakhs (17X) in 6 years. I have HDFC Bank, ITC, Persistent System, Arman Finance, Maruti, Titan, ICICI Bank, TCS, and NMDC in my portfolio.

I know my XIRR (22%) may not be impressive in today’s scenario but I would suggest don’t sell your  
winner for a small gain. If you are holding good companies, there is potential it could be 25X or 50X in the long term. Also, think what difference it will make to your wealth if u even make 5k in 6 months on a 10k investment. It will surely make a difference if u make 2.5 lakh from 10k.

ITC, because cigarettes and Yippee is better than Maggie.

ACE, because there is a lot of redevelopment going on in my area and all the construction equipment I see is of ACE

ABFRL because I still shop from Pantaloons.

Airtel because I have been using their network since more than 15 years

Ambuja Cement because maternal uncle has its agency in Village and he really went from rags to riches selling it

BPCL because there I've been refueling there and never been scammed

CDSL because you and I are still investing and will keep on investing

DLINK because I have a router of the same company and got a better one just a few years back and did not face any issue

DMART because I shop there monthly with no regrets

IRCTC/IRFC because I still prefer travelling via trains rather than flights

JKumar because I see their barriers everywhere in Mumbai

MGL because I have uninterrupted gas supply at both of my places.

SBI because I've a bank account with them since 2008 and have never faced any issue 

TATAMOTORS, because I have a tigor and it hasn't disappointed me yet.

TATAPOWER/ADANIPOWER because of uninterrupted electricity except for certain regular maintenance downtime

Ofcourse, I do some fundamental analysis before I invest but I don't spend more than 15 mins per stock. It also helps that I started around 2021, during the Covid boom so my return numbers are quite skewed.

post,1k8c0i1,"Amara Raja v Exide Detailed Analysis (tech plans, payoff, operations and bottlenecks)",DaInvictus,"Exide has a much bigger market share historically, especially in automotive (cars, trucks), industrial batteries, inverter batteries, and telecom power solutions. It's been around forever and is deeply entrenched.

Amara raja came later but focused heavily on higher quality, longer-life batteries. They built a strong brand in maintenance-free automotive batteries and in industrial UPS (uninterruptible power supply) solutions.

**Exide:**  
Set up **Exide Energy Solutions**, a new subsidiary focused only on lithium-ion batteries.

* Building a **large gigafactory** for lithium-ion cell manufacturing (in Karnataka).
* They’ve also tied up with Chinese companies (like SVOLT) for technical know-how — mainly because making Li-ion cells is a different game from making lead-acid batteries.

Tech-focus:  
Mainly focusing on **Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP)** and **Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC)** chemistries.

* Through partnerships (especially with **SVOLT Energy**, a Chinese company), they’re accessing:
   * **LFP**: safer, cheaper, longer life — good for mass-market EVs, buses, and grid storage.
   * **NMC**: higher energy density — good for premium EVs (more range, smaller battery).
* Exide is not talking much about solid-state yet (they're still focused on scaling basic Li-ion first).
* Also minor activities in **advanced lead-acid** tech for hybrid vehicles (like Start-Stop batteries).

**Amara Raja:**

* They have announced plans for a **Giga Corridor** — a cluster to manufacture lithium cells and battery packs, plus a recycling plant.
* They are investing in **research partnerships** (with IITs, etc.) and setting up an **Energy and Mobility R&D center**.
* Amara Raja seems to be targeting **energy storage systems (ESS)** too — not just EVs, but also grid backup, renewables, etc.

Tech Fodus:  
Also focused on **LFP** and **NMC** — similar chemistry bets.

* But they are **more vocal** about working on **solid-state batteries** and **lithium-titanate (LTO)** chemistries in their R&D.
   * **Solid-state batteries**: potentially safer, denser, future of EVs — still 3-5 years away commercially.
   * **LTO**: fast-charging, super-safe but heavier and lower energy density — great for grid storage and buses, less for cars.

Their *Energy & Mobility Research Centre* is supposed to be exploring beyond just classic Li-ion.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Short term/ Long term:

**Exide is clearly more aggressive today.**

* They've already committed ₹6,000+ crore for their gigafactory.
* Their JV with SVOLT gives them **ready access** to proven Li-ion cell tech (important because making *cells* is much harder than assembling *packs*).
* They have a running timetable: start production 2025–26.

**Amara Raja is still playing cautious:**

* They have committed around ₹9,500 crore **over many years** for a full corridor — cells, packs, R&D, recycling.
* But right now, they are still building facilities.
* Their serious cell manufacturing will only start 2026–27 (if no delays).

My take on all this:

**Exide is the clear winner short term, if solid state is achieved by amara raja though, we score big. However some major problems: Require great amount of capital. They're focussing on Make in India.. no reliable partnerships for R&D and manufacturing yet.. In the mean time they may fall behind in LFP and NMC scaling as well.. I plan on reassessing Amara Raja sometime in the future, once I have access to more quality info regarding their progress in R&D.**",2025-04-26 12:39:37,11.0,4.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1k8c0i1/amara_raja_v_exide_detailed_analysis_tech_plans/,IndianStreetBets

post,1juoims,India: The Overlooked Powerhouse in the U.S.-China Tariff Storm,Practical_Trash_1994,"As the U.S. unleashes its latest salvo of tariffs in April 2025—10% across the board, with punishing extras like 34% on China and 26% on India—global chatter fixates on China. How will Beijing retaliate (it just did, with a matching 34% on U.S. goods)? Could it even twist this chaos into a win, cementing a new world order? Forums buzz with speculation, and China dominates the spotlight. Fair enough—it’s the second-largest economy, a manufacturing titan, and a geopolitical lightning rod. But here’s what most are missing: India, not just a bystander, could be the real sleeper hit in this tariff tempest. Not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon enough, India’s poised to claim its spot as a global economic pole—and we’d be wise to see it coming.

# Why India’s Being Slept On

India isn’t the loudest voice in the room right now. It’s not hurling retaliatory tariffs with the ferocity of China or scrambling for headlines like Vietnam (46% U.S. tariff) or Bangladesh. But dismiss it at your peril. By 2030, India’s projected to be the world’s third-largest economy, overtaking Japan and Germany, fueled by a population of 1.4 billion and a democracy that’s the planet’s biggest. Unlike China, it’s not locked in a zero-sum slugfest with the U.S. Unlike smaller players, it’s got scale—massive domestic consumption and robust supply chains that don’t collapse under pressure. Anand Mahindra hit the nail on the head in his April 4, 2025, X post: India’s internal market and self-reliance make it a quiet giant in this trade war. While China’s exports take a $66 billion hit from U.S. tariffs, India’s $66 billion loss stings less—its economy isn’t as export-dependent. That’s a strength hiding in plain sight.

# The Multipolar Moment

This isn’t just about surviving tariffs; it’s about seizing a multipolar world. The U.S.-China clash is fracturing the old order—Europe’s waffling, Pakistan might cozy up to China, and Southeast Asia’s haggling with Washington. India, though, has a shot at being a new anchor. It’s not overnight—Vietnam’s agility and Indonesia’s low costs are real threats—but India’s got what they don’t: size, stability, and near-universal goodwill. Relations with the U.S., EU, Japan, and even Russia are solid. A zero-tariff deal with the U.S., floated in X posts and hinted at in Reuters’ April 2025 coverage, could unlock $23 billion in exports—think phones, drugs, textiles. India’s not just a factory; it’s a market and a partner. That’s leverage China can’t match right now.

# Learning from the Past

Trump’s first term handed India a similar opening. Tariffs on China in 2018-2019 pushed firms like Foxconn to Chennai, assembling iPhones by 2019. But India didn’t run with it—bureaucracy and high tariffs (Trump’s “tariff king” jab) let Vietnam and Mexico steal the show. Vietnam’s U.S. exports jumped 40% by 2020; India’s global export share loafed at 1.68%. This time, the game’s bigger—U.S. tariffs are broader, China’s counterpunches sharper. India can’t afford to fumble again. A measured response, not knee-jerk retaliation, is key—26% U.S. tariffs hurt, but they’re a bargaining chip, not a death knell.

post,1i41elj,Kalyan jewellers a overhated but interesting stock,Snoo37787,"[Reposted from the first thread]

Before I continue I will interate I have this stock from 100 levels, I know most of you will downvote it mostly and it's fine but I had to make sure that retailers are not getting screwed over by rumours and fake news 

Over the past month kalyan has gone down 35% from its peak , many are calling it names pump and dump and what not, even abusing motilal oswal who got the stock at 350 (an entry which according to me will never come again) 

The allegations on the management are quite frankly absurd and nonsense, none of it has any proof nor has any sebi investigation been triggered 


Now you may say ""you are biased cause you hold it"" yes I am , but I also did my own DD on the stock before I entered it even at 100 levels. When Kalyan jewellers did it's ipo back in 2021 they made 125 crores from ofs , yes 125 crores . They made no money from this stock, they instead purchased more on leverage at 530, now go try doing this for the latest stocks most of the ipo is pure ofs, offloading their garbage on retail and retail eating it, find me such a quality management which puts their money where their mouth is, I will wait


Now onto the allegations -

1) kalyan jewellers paid mutual funds to buy their shares in the fund, why would a company pay fund managers to buy their company when it's growing at twice the pace of the rest of the industry small or big in size? That too in a 80k crores company, sebi isn't so dumb man please let's get that out of the way

2) IT raid , ED raid, if such raids happen to a business family of their level u will see it on news, they were the 30th richest in india just 2 weeks ago and they have many more unlisted business which makes them a very prominent family of south india, u will see it in news but guess what? U didn't cause it is false

3) if the fund manager bribery was not fluff this one certainly tops the list , apparently they bribed ED to avoid arrest , I have heard better stories from drunk beggars

4) inventory overvaluation, for such a company where their inventory is almost the size of titan there is a huge huge audit process with multiple checks and balances , independent as well, u can't just overvalued ur inventory at that scale, it's a national scandal and it will cause chaos 😂 let's be realistic, kalyan jewellers is one of the top 5 gold importers into the country last year, that's the level at which they deal, inventory overvaluation is absurd at so many levels in this case

5) promotors got FIR, if any such cases are running again it will be all over the news ,it needs to be declared to stock exchange 


The overall fall seems to be the product of both the stock being a tad bit overvalued from the top (around 15-20%) along with unfounded rumour mongering, the only ones that made money here are the bears who had a short position in this stock from the very beginning, there was unusual oi in the short side of this stock from December itself , I track it so I noticed it, they refused to sell their shorts even when the stock hit ath, at the time didn't make sense to me , I mean 40% growth update and yet who has the balls to short like that, now it all adds up, they always planned to wait for the promotors trading window to close before they attacked the stock and they chose then business update day to buy cheap shorts as well from open market 


About corporate governance of kalyan have no doubt it's first class
The chairman of the board is the former CAG of india vinod rai, he was the one who exposed the 2G scam of the ruling government without being scared of the PMO , he won't be involved or allowing such things to happen under him, it's all a lot of rumours to get cheap stocks by the institutes according to me

It's a well elaborated short attack according to me , because 2 weeks are over sebi has neither sent any notice to the company nor has there been any news of tax evasion or promotor arrest



This also reminds me of a similar attack same time last year and motilal was a top holder in this stock as well, stock market participants may have short term memory but the charts don't forget, polycab
Polycab had a lot of allegations (which was true considering there was real news as well) stock fell 30% and then went on to give 75% returns in a yearly basis 
I do not believe motilal will invest 10% aum in a company based on a bribe and I do not believe motilal will invest 10% aum without proper check on CG
Now the rest readers can take it as it may
I haven't sold a single share in this fall, I don't intend to, I see the stock hitting 1500 in 2 years considering it's forward pe for next year is just 40. Even taking normal or expansion what I said is very fair value for it

I remain long and bullish on the stock, those who say ""don't compare it to titan"" just check the data , data doesn't lie , titan is slipping , they have 8% market share of organised play and kalyan has 7, they had just 4 , just 2 years ago, one is claiming they will hit 10 from the past 3 years one will hit it in a year without needing to make tall claims
Data doesn't lie nor does factual information,
 Good luck investing and take care",2025-01-18 06:20:42,2.0,11.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1i41elj/kalyan_jewellers_a_overhated_but_interesting_stock/,IndianStreetBets

Titan is giving subpar performance of single digits also sometimes and we have given it a 95 pe, titan has 50% more premium even on a forward basis with much much slower growth and management crying in every single concall about competition and sluggishness, they first refused to accept competition and when it finally started taking market share they started randomly throwing in a few stores to fight that, I am sorry titan isn't what it used to be in the past decade, something has changed their management is unable to understand the on ground situation but it's fine you can give it 95 pe for 9% growth 👍",2025-01-18 06:21:14,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1i41elj/kalyan_jewellers_a_overhated_but_interesting_stock/,IndianStreetBets

post,1g9nmbk,Planning to take 10L loan for long term( Oct - Dec time investment),rohit9967,"Hi Reddit family,

With the market trending down, I'm considering some promising stocks such as Tata Motors, CDSL, Bajaj Housing Finance, Castrol, TCS, ONGC, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Steel, UltraTech Cement, Reliance, Tata Tech, Tata Consumer Products, Britannia, Titan, IEX, Coal India, BEL, IOC, and Nifty ETFs.

These are potential stocks and indices I’m looking at, but I plan to narrow it down to just 10 for investment (mostly focusing on Tata stocks).

I’ve been investing for the long term over the past few years and am not in a rush to withdraw the invested money, as it’s meant solely for investment. Additionally, I can manage to pay off my loan in a few months (maximum 4-5 months).

I would appreciate your guidance on whether this is a good decision and any advice or suggestions you might have. 


I’m planning to invest between October and December, and I intend to hold some investments until the U.S. election period and results. What are your thoughts on this? Kindly guide me.

post,1hmncst,Gorilla Framework: Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s Right-Hand Strategy,SuperbPercentage8050,"**Gorilla Framework is a strategy by Utpal Sheth, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala's right-hand man**. It focuses on investing in dominant companies that lead across market cycles and show long-term growth and adaptability.(This strategy aligns well with my High-quality checklist framework I shared earlier. You can check it out  )

These businesses are termed 'gorilla' stocks, similar to a gorilla, because of the dominance they have in the ecosystem thanks to its strength and adaptability across climates.

By combining this strategy with the **Corporate Cycle framework,** you can improve your stock picking and spot potential gorillas, especially if you identify them in the 2nd or 3rd stage of the corporate cycle.

**What makes a company a gorilla? Five qualities that classify a company as a gorilla:**

* Rare: **There are many monkeys in the jungle, but very few gorillas.** Gorillas are rare market leaders with unique qualities that set them apart.
* Dominant: **Gorillas are outsized and dominant**. These businesses command the lion's share of their markets and have significant influence over their industries. 
* Moats and knights: **Gorillas are not challenged by monkeys.** They protect their leadership with structural moats, such as branding, distribution, intellectual property and knight-like resilience that fends off competitors.(Asian Paints will be tested again to see if it still holds its dominance as a gorilla, it has proved several times the past)
* Longevity: **A gorilla endures over decades, not just through one cycle** Such companies consistently evolve and remain relevant, showcasing their ability to survive and thrive.(Commodities, automobile, and power companies don’t fit this category as they only perform well during upcycles when prices rise due to supply-demand imbalances and supply chain issues or their is a credit and capex cycle)
* Right jungle, right animal:Every day, you should pray to find the right jungle and the right gorilla.Success lies in aligning with the right industry and identifying its dominant player.(**Focus on companies with long growth potential and large addressable markets. Look into sectors like cybersecurity, the shift of APIs from China, AI ecosystem players, Fiberization** **, and India's digitalisation**, **Aerospace,Defence**).
* Avoid commodities and chemical stocks because firstly they lack pricing power, no real product differentiation and very few parameter align with the high quality checklist framework. Chemical sector is still trading at very expensive valuations and it is not the right jungle and animal for wealth creation.

**5L Grid to spotting gorillas(Gorilla Investing focuses on the first two categories:Legends and Leaders)**

It is a structured way of understanding where companies stand regarding market importance and leadership potential. It categorises businesses into five types:

# Gorilla investing focuses on the first two categories. 

* Legends:**They are the rarest of the rare, with enduring dominance over decades.** Nestle and Apple are examples of 'legend' companies, as they have shown long-standing leadership by evolving with their industries and staying relevant over time most of the companies that will fall in this category will be founder driven.
* Leaders: **Leaders are dominant players with the potential to become legends**.Leaders are gorillas in their markets, showing consistent ability to fend off competition and sustain growth.Companies like HDFC Bank, TITAN, Bajaj finance, Asian paints are examples of leaders who have demonstrated adaptability and scalability.
* Laggards: These are businesses that have struggled to grow or adapt.**Laggards fail to capitalise on opportunities, often because of inefficiencies or lack of innovation.**
* Losers: A company is defined as a 'loser' when it consistently destroys value.**Losers erode shareholder value through poor decisions and structural inefficiencies**
* Lallus: Companies that merely exist without creating significant value. **Most companies fall under the Lallus category. They don't destroy value, but they don't create it either; they just exist.**

In the long run, only a few businesses dominate. Finding these gorillas and investing in them is how wealth is built. **I hope you can see the connection between the gorilla framework and the high-quality checklist framework.**

Focus on 'Legends' and 'Leaders', combine them with other frameworks, and adjust your investment strategy.The strategy demands discipline, patience and a deep understanding of what you own and the industry that business operates in.

Happy investing! Share this with your friends and family if you find it helpful

Check your portfolio and see if you're holding a Gorilla or a Lallu.

I am a non finance guy and unable to guess when can a share price move according to its profits.
Indus towers: reported very good number for fy24. And this H1 it already near to total profit mark of fy24. Still the stock didn't move.
Leave the share price, why still pe is still so low of 12. 

Sun tv: of course we can't expect some blockbuster number every year, but it is consistently generating good amount of money every year and is consistently paying a good dividend. The profit are more than doubled in last 10 years still pe is 16?
At the sametime, Zee which is same business is at pe of 27.

Agarwal industrial: this company too is generating good profit you. Still pe is so low why.

How can I know when will the pe rerating happen. I am unable to guess what will be the share price if one company provides some ""xyz"" profit.

post,1hqurg2,"In 1985, this man borrowed $100 from his brother-in-law and turned it into $5.8 billion",Broad-Research5220,"Rakesh, a young man with a hundred-dollar dream, borrowed money from his brother-in-law. Everyone scoffed, ""Get a real job!"" they cried, ""The market's a gamble!"" But Rakesh, fueled by an unwavering belief, plunged into the world of stocks.

He stumbled, he fell, he doubted himself. But instead of giving up, he delved into the world of successful companies, studying them like a detective. And then, a breakthrough! In Tata Tea, he saw a hidden gem, a diamond in the rough. He bet his entire hundred dollars, and boy, did it pay off!

Rakesh, now emboldened, scoured the market for overlooked opportunities. He unearthed Crisil, Lupin, and other future giants, investing early and reaping the rewards.

Then came Titan, a tiny watch company. Everyone scoffed, ""Luxury watches in India? Forget it!"" But Rakesh saw a vision: a rising middle class, a nation dreaming big. He bet big on Titan, and his faith was rewarded.

Through market crashes, panics, and corrections, Rakesh remained steadfast. He understood the true power: owning exceptional companies for the long haul. His portfolio blossomed, encompassing Star Health, Metro Brands, and Tata Motors.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, the man who dared to dream, proved that with patience, perseverance, and a keen eye for value, even a hundred dollars can blossom into a fortune.

I made few basic research such as:

-How is the profit last 3 years.

post,1gqjpgz,"Kalyan Jewellers India Limited, concall and update for H1 and Q2 fy 2025",Snoo37787,"Before i move forward as usual i will state a few things-

1. i own significant shares of kalyan jewellers at much lower averages
2. i believe PE is high there is rick but there is also reward
3. just noting down what i heard and my views, cant be considered as any sort of stock recommendation

**update for H1 and Q2 fy 25**\-

* revenue growth for H1 at 32 % on consolidated basis/ 34% in india q2 growth at 37% consolidated and 39% india adjusting to the inventory loss, gross margins and pbt margins were higher store wise YOY
* 49 showrooms launched for kalyan , and  34 candere showrooms (target of 80 kalyan and 50 candere by end of q4)  small delay in opening american store will open by end of q3
* debt reduction well on track- half of the loans for this year has been reduced (143 cr/ 300 )
* waiting for release of collateral from loans repaid last year , land will be liquidated on getting it back
* something i would like to state is there is **INVENTORY LOSS** due to excise tax reduction in the budget of 2024, where the rate of taxation came down from 15% to 6% , a total fall of 9%, what happened here is several massive players like titan and kalyan had gold in GOLD METAL LOAN wherein they have to pay the excise cost in advance so when it was cut off they all instantly lost that 9%, most of the hold was hedged in MCX , like for titan kalyan heding policy is around 98-99% , senco it is 90%, so there was a notional loss of 120 crores which got accounted into this quarter , causing a fall of 69 crores out of 120.
* the real PAT stands at 199 crores vs 135 of same quarter YOY basis which indicates a nice 40% growth in PAT, wasnt reflexted due to one time loss (divided into 2 quarters) which means there will be a significant jump in EPS in 2025 now for same quarters causing massive  PE crash so keep that in account
* another 50 odd crores of inventory loss will seep into q3

my 2 bits on this result- kalyan has been the most efficient of all the other brands senco had a 25% eps degrowth so did titan, kalyan had a mere 3%. their revenue growth pretty much outpaced what was a loss for the entire industry and made the results look flat when its actually exceptional

**SSSG (SAME STORE SALES GROWTH ) 20%**

* strong demand for current quarter as of now
* good studded share of 30%
* franchise revenue share around 30%
* LAB GROWN diamond has NO DEMAND on store levels , they happy to stock it for sale as they are retailers but theres no demand so they didnt try to promote it also a fluctuation in prices doesnt encourage buyers
* competition as usual, theres no impact from it , network effect is playing impact,they have no pricing competition other than usual
* depreciation has gone up QOQ  because kalyan owns the lease to all the stores and subleases it to the franchise to safeguard against loss of store area in case of disagreement with franchise owner,so thats why theres depreciation more

**CANDERE-** \[ competition to caratlane of tanishq\]

* focus on expanding footprint
* still opening stores . they plan to start agressive campaigns to promote candere
* plans to open more brands after candere is more successful, medium term plans
* plan to get into the high end luxury market and the low margin high stock market (value for money)

**middle east and south india expansion**

* kalyan was focused on expansion in the non south are because of higher margins and interest for franchise
* they have issues getting more hold in south (they are aldready very strong) because of less franchise interest due to lower margin region same with middle east
* trying to find a solution for above issue with some inclusion of all types of products to impress the franchise partners to take up, if this works expansion next year would be into a lot of south and middle east
* new stores they will get 0.25% more share after 1 year completion of the franchise
* for next year they expect more than 80 stores again. the exact number depends on the deal to make international and south india more favourable to operate
* debt reduction of next year around 350-400 crores
* plans to open around 30 showrooms in US UK EUROPE SINGAPORE etc in total over the next few years

PBT GROWTH MORE THAN REVENUE GROWTH AND THIS IS THE LONG TERM GOAL

post,1jnynqp,Will the stock market be in a bearish trend? Probably we will see in this week.,chouchou1erim,"The debate over whether U.S. stocks have entered a bear market is intensifying. Historically, a pullback of **less than 10%** is seen as a ""healthy correction within a bull market,"" a **15% decline** signals a ""correction phase,"" while a **20%+ drop** typically marks a ""technical bear market.""

The S&P 500 has retreated approximately **10%** from its peak, hovering at a critical juncture. This week’s performance will be decisive: If this is merely a healthy correction, markets should rebound strongly and reclaim new highs soon. However, futures markets suggest diminishing odds of such a scenario:

* **Nasdaq futures fell 1.2%** amid reports that Trump is pressuring advisors to escalate tariffs, raising fears of a U.S.-led global trade war.
* **Geopolitical risks surged** after Putin’s armored convoy exploded in central Moscow, potentially worsening Russia-Ukraine tensions.
* **April 2nd** looms as the deadline for the U.S. to unveil new tariff policies, amplifying market anxiety and safe-haven demand.

Amid this uncertainty, Citi outlines three scenarios:

1. **Reciprocal tariffs only** → Limited market impact.
2. **Reciprocal tariffs + VAT adjustments** → U.S. dollar could rally 50-100 basis points, pressuring equities.
3. **Reciprocal tariffs + VAT + sector-specific tariffs** → Deeper equity market correction.

Gold has emerged as the top safe-haven play, while short-term traders are bidding up volatility. ORATS data shows **elevated near-term implied volatility premiums**, signaling investors are pricing in immediate risks.

**Will April 2nd Trigger a Crash?**

A common question in trading communities reflects market sentiment: *“Is now the time to long VIX? Should I enter on March 31 or April 1?”*

But Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett argues the real inflection point may be **April 4th’s nonfarm payrolls data**. Strong jobs numbers could fuel a rebound, while weak data might push the S&P 500 lower. Hartnett emphasizes that **macro fundamentals**, not short-term policy noise, will ultimately drive markets.

**Technical Analysis: Key Support Levels**

Historically, the **50-week moving average (MA)** has acted as a floor during past corrections. The S&P 500 recently breached this level. A confirmed close below the 50-week MA this week—especially if sustained—would signal a bearish regime shift, with the next major support at the **200-week MA**.

Savvy investors know: **Trend confirmation is key**. Opportunities exist in any market:

* **Bull market**: Buy dips in tech titans or undervalued growth stocks. e.g. META, GOOGL, AAPL, AIFU, NET, DOCN, IT, ACN, NVDA, TSLA, ACVA, MA, QTWO, DDOG
* **Bear market**: Short overvalued growth stocks.

**Will the S&P 500 break below its 50-week MA? Let's wait and see.**",2025-03-31 08:45:47,48.0,51.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1jnynqp/will_the_stock_market_be_in_a_bearish_trend/,StockMarket

comment,1jnynqp,,,,,,,mknsszu,WappieK,"I have been following the stock market since 2000. Normally we see the stock market price in any threat in about 6 months in advance.

In 2008 & 2009 we had a serious depression and economists warned us about too much debt and inflated stock values. The global monetary strategy should have been decreasing debt (from states and banks to individuals) and improving the strength of economic fundamentals in the west (especially Europe) such as production versus (derivative) services.

Instead we increased our debt. Especially during Covid. A lot of money has been printed and ended up in financial products. Now the stock markets are pumped full of air. Bitcoin is 77k. Tesla at a 130 PE.

As long as everybody keeps believing the market will not crash. But now we have Trump's erratic behavior. I expect it to be the the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. It already lowered consumer confidence & worldwide export. Personally I think some companies deserve their stock value decimated like Tesla, Palantir or Gamestop. Others should be revalued. Not everything is bad. Companies like Nvidia, Apple or BDO will still be good companies to invest in but right now everything is too overvalued.

The thing is that even right now with everything \~15% down on average the market is still lagging behind on reality. Until we get a quarterly loss of for example Tesla, a spike in unemployment, fastly decreasing consumption and rising inflation, people will start realizing that a new economic realism has to be embraced.

post,1irey65,Broadcom and TSMC in Talks to Carve Up Intel’s Declining Realm,wes70lan,"According to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, industry giants Broadcom $AVGO and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) are reportedly in talks to carve up Intel’s declining realm.

Intel, once the indomitable titan of the chip-making world, has been struggling to maintain its dominance and is now considering a major division. Broadcom is eyeing Intel’s chip design and marketing division, while TSMC is poised to take over Intel’s manufacturing arm. This potential dismantling could align Intel with the growing industry trend where companies focus on either designing or manufacturing chips, but not both.

It’s incredible to think that a company as big and important as Intel, a name synonymous with innovation and technological advancement, is now facing such a drastic fate. One day, it was the undisputed leader in the semiconductor industry, and the next day, it looks like it might be divided and taken over. The market tilt is indeed ruthless.

The discussions are still in the early stages, and no formal offers have been made yet. However, Intel’s recent tribulations, including falling behind TSMC in advanced chip production and the abrupt departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger, have left it in a vulnerable position.

It's fascinating to witness how the landscape of the semiconductor industry might shift if this deal goes through. What do you all think about this potential carve-up? Do you believe it will spell the end of an era for Intel, or could this be the rebirth it desperately needs?",2025-02-17 08:06:55,70.0,40.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1irey65/broadcom_and_tsmc_in_talks_to_carve_up_intels/,StockMarket

comment,1irey65,,,,,,,md7y52p,OrangeHitch,"As you said, Intel was an important player.  The chip shortage that followed COVID woke up a lot of people to the need for American semiconductor manufacturing and Biden passed the CHIPS act to make it happen.  I haven't followed that news closely, but I vaguely recall TSMC wanting to build a plant in the USA.  With Taiwan under threat from China and the USA wanting manufacturers, I can definitely see a push for that move.

I project that Washington will do whatever it takes to make this breakup happen and to approve the buyouts.  They don't have time to see if Intel can pull itself back up again.

post,1jpylah,Soft Landing is or Steam Roller?,Due-Firefighter3206,"All anyone is seeing right now is ""soft landings"" and ""economic slowdowns"". I disagree. 'I'm predicting a very likely chance we experience a recession late 2025 - early 2026 and no one is ready for it

I think a recession is likely because reliable and effective indicators (e.g. yield curve inversion, LEI indices, and Sahm Rule) have been indicating a recession since 2022, and we haven't seen one yet. I also believe there is an increasing likelihood of a ""black swan"" event from geopolitical escalation, financial crisis, or policy missteps in the near term. Tensions continue to tighten between the U.S., Iran, Russia, and China. Consumer debt is through the roof, the national debt is insurmountable, and the cost-of-living vs. income spread is ever-expanding. Markets are not pricing any of this in.

I'm very confident in my research and am seriously looking for challenges to my perspective. Please hit my hypothesis with a massive hammer. Any serious questions or insights that I'm overlooking will be considered with great attention.

post,1ion5aq,"Can you explain to me, why Performance shipping is traded this low?",DogeTradingRetard,"Alright, investors, let’s talk about Performance Shipping (PSHG). This micro-cap tanker stock is trading at $1.57 (as of Feb 2025) despite a $3/share cash tender offer from Sphinx Investment Corp to acquire the remaining 90.5% of the company. The offer has been extended five times and now expires on Feb 18, 2025. 

Meanwhile, the company’s intrinsic value is estimated at $7.60–$18.23/share based on DCF models, and Wall Street analysts have a $6.63 average price target. Key Metrics:

•	⁠Market cap: $19.2M vs. enterprise value: -$1.18M (yes, negative). 

•	⁠P/E ratio: 0.4x vs. industry average of 4.2x. 

•	⁠Price/Book: 0.07x – literally cheaper than a 2007 Aframax tanker in a scrapyard. 

•	⁠Shares tendered so far: 1.7M (~14% of float).

The Bull Case:

1️⃣ $3 Offer = 91% Premium: Sphinx (controlled by shipping magnate George Economou) is offering $3/share in cash. Even if you think Economou is the Gordon Gekko of Greek shipping, this is free upside if the deal closes.

2️⃣ Negative Enterprise Value: The company has more cash than debt. You’re basically getting tankers for free.

3️⃣ Insider Ownership: CEO Andreas Michalopoulos and Chairwoman Aliki Paliou control ~90% of voting rights. If they’re holding out for a higher bid, this could get spicy.

The Bear Case: •	⁠Takeover Drama: Economou’s offer is highly conditional, and management is fighting it like the Titanic vs. an iceberg. Lawsuits, proxy battles, and a classified board structure are delaying the inevitable. •	⁠Low Liquidity: 12.4M shares outstanding, but insiders + institutions own ~15%. Float is tiny, so volatility goes up and down.

The Real Question: Is this a value trap or a takeover jackpot? The market hates uncertainty, but with the stock trading at 1/5th of its DCF value and a cash offer double the current price, it feels like a glitch in the Matrix.

TLDR: PSHG is either the dumbest stock alive or the easiest 91% return you’ll make in 2025. Either way, grab popcorn and watch the Greeks fight over tankers. 🍿🇬🇷

post,1hyoz1i,Outstanding Returns by Sheer Luck!,_RyanD_,"While reading investment books to get the new year started off right, I came across this gem of an anecdote:



In his book *The Smartest Portfolio You’ll Ever Own*, Daniel Solin advocates for a very Bogle-y approach to investing: pick asset allocations based on risk tolerance, use index funds, and rebalance periodically. (That's a one sentence summary of the whole book. You're welcome.)



Here's the interesting bit: In the chapter ""The Myth of Skill"", Solin claims that ""outstanding returns can be achieved by sheer luck."" Definitely a talking point for index investors. To prove this he picks 10 US stock tickers based only on the letters of his last name: S-O-L-I-N; two for each letter. He claims that from January 2010 through November 2010, these 10 stocks returned 45% to the S&P's less than 6%. But what's really interesting is looking at these 10 stocks through today, 15 years later.



If Solin had invested equally in his 10 ""random"" stocks in January 2010 and then forgot about his account until this month, ***he would have 34x his money***!! Sure, this is another NVDA-go-boom story, but it's amusing because of the context of the picks and being forever immortalized in print.



So, buy index funds -- or throw some darts and hang on for the ride.



|Company|Total Returns (Including Dividends)|
|:-|:-|
|Sprint Nextel (S) \*|732%|
|Sirius XM Radio (SIRI)|85%|

|International Business Machines (IBM)|141%|
|NetSuite (N) \*\*|838%|
|Nvidia (NVDA)|30,929%|
|Total (Equally Weighted)|3,399%|



\* Sprint shareholders received a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for each Sprint share on April 1, 2020. Total Returns are based on this conversion & T-Mobile's price in Jan 2025.

post,1ds840v,Sharing Research on $PLTR after tons of weekend noise,Big_Quench,"Sometimes, I see the name on Reddit…

...sometimes, the ticker pops up on StockTwits…

…sometimes, my friends and coworkers tell me about the gains they make from this ticker…

But after 3 weekend articles by Motley Fool surrounding Palantir Technologies, and while I look for my next long-term buy and hold going into Monday, as well as the inevitable rise of artificial intelligence over the next few years, I figured it was time…

…time for **THE ULTIMATE DUE DILLIGENCE REPORT ON $PLTR** - get your minds right and lock it in, because this is about to be some no-joke fucking research.

For a cute elevator-intro, **Palantir Technologies ($PLTR \~ NYSE)** was founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel, Alex Karp, and Stephen Cohen, with the mission to transform commercialized data analytics through the power of artificial intelligence.

The company develops software products for large institutions and government agencies that allows enormous data sets to be analyzed in just seconds.

Imagine blinking and you have a Pivot Table on Excel, except the data set is made up of a statewide census 🤯.

Looking at some basic financial valuations on the fundamental side, Palantir market cap is listed as $45 billion, while reeling in $2.21 billion in revenue in 2023 for a net income of $341 million. EPS in 2023 capped at $0.18.For profitability, the company reported an 81% gross margin in 2023, plus a net margin of 10%.

\^I know, that is boring shit but it matters for a buy-and-hodl deal {;)}.

After at all that mumbo-jumbo, the big names in Wall Street research think that $PLTR is a ‘buy-and-hold’ for years to come - like I said, Motley Fool, Yahoo Finance, even [Zacks.com](http://Zacks.com), although they gave them a Zacks rating of #3 for the short-term, which means that they’re likely to move in the same direction as the market.

Now, with the SPX falling off a cliff in the back half of the trading day on Friday 6/28, I don’t know if a 2.69 5Y Beta stock is the best place to move position into, but July historically is a month for the Bulls - maybe $PLTR is MJ.

Moving right along, $PLTR closed the trading day 6/28 at $25.33 a share, after a 6.25% rise on the week, compared to $SPX’s stagnancy in the same period.

$PLTR has been up for inclusion on the S&P 500 since 2023, but has yet to make the cut - yet it seems to have a lot of attention.

Palantir Tech barely missed earnings projections by 1.59% just a short year ago, but since then has hit the market on all the analyst’s projections - their YOY earnings for the last missed projection is set to release in 36 days - this will be detrimental to the future of their shareholders.

Let’s size-up against the comp.  
  
Being in big-tech and big-data puts you up against some big names. IBM is running the sector for data and AI innovation and Snowflake is on a popularity rise bigger than Palantir.

Nonetheless, $PLTR, has established secure government contracts like those of their competitors, but the business is heavily reliant on those contracts as it stands.

However, when your business model is centered around AI, I find it hard to believe that there won’t be further innovation from the company that can propel itself past the Titans o’ Tech, but the Bears have faked us out with the candlesticks before.

The Bear argument is centered around the dependency on government contracts and skepticism around the security of these lump-sums of data Palantir has at their disposal.

But the way a subreddit can be protected by AI Mod bots, I’m taking AI in 4 games against any hacker lol.

Artificial Intelligence is an immediate advantage in today's day and age, but more and more PTOs are taking advantage of the emerging flame - the team at Palantir will have their work cut out for them, but their advanced solutions and strong government relationships give me security for a long-term hold.

**The Set Up**

Plain and simple - we’re looking for a confirmed break over $27.45, buy, and forget my friends.

post,1iwk3xp,Celsius Holdings - Future Energy Titan or Stumbling Beverage Brand ?,XerialTradingNetwork,"Celsius Holdings (CELH) has recently reported a 3% increase in full-year 2024 revenue, totalling $1.36 billion, with retail sales up 22% and market share rising to 11.8%.
The company also announced a $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Nu, aiming to enhance its position in the functional beverage market.

However, challenges persist. Fourth-quarter revenue declined by 4.4% and earnings per share decreased from $0.77 to $0.45. 

Analysts have mixed views; some express caution due to slowing sales growth and increased competition, while others maintain a price target of $47.56, suggesting potential upside from the current trading price of $32.62.

post,1hfpel0,$AVGO Analysis [DD]  ----,MorganTargaryen,"Broadcom(AVGO)

This ticker is surfing multiple growth waves, including the AI boom, 5G rollout, and enterprise software takeover. My research reflects a top-tier supplier of custom chips powering cloud titans like AWS and Google Cloud, and its recent $61 billion VMware acquisition just opened a fat new cash spigot with juicy profit margins. With AI and 5G still in the early innings, Broadcoms got a serious baller vibe rn.

Financially, Broadcom is a cash cow. Were talking monster gross margins at 75% and a cash-printing machine generating around $16 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Dividends are popping off, up 24% annually over five years, and the current yield at 2.3% isnt too shabby for a growth beast.

On valuation, this stock looks like a steal. Trading at \~20x forward earnings, its way cheaper than high-flyers like NVIDIA, despite packing serious growth potential. Analysts are eyeing the $1,000+ zone for the stock in the next few years, which spells a tasty upside from here.

The risks? Regulatory heat and a macro slowdown could throw some shade, but Broadcoms diversified playbook spreads the risk nicely.

TL;DR: Broadcom is a money-printing machine crushing it in semis and software. With AI, 5G, and VMware in its corner, this one’s a no-brainer. Slap a $950 short-term target on it, and long-term, its got legs to hit $1,200+.

This is a strong buy imho especially with guidance into 2027!!

Position: All my savings 19 shares @ 239.40

If rates decrease fractionally, AVGO will gain as will many other stocks which have debt (since the debt will be cheaper to finance). But if rates hold (which I'm not expecting, but it's the only likely outcome other than a small decrease), then if there's a dip - AVGO might weather it because of potential future sales. 2025 is going to be a big year for AVGO (Broadcom) now that they've identified how to tap into the AI vein. They have decades of sales experience, and have always been a ""behind-the-scenes: constantly shipping"" kind of company; a company that will essentially be selling the next-gen design of, and accessories for, the ""shovels"" in the AI boom.

post,1is1fba,"Thomson Reuters stock (TRI) was falsely accused of ""social deception"" by special govt. employee Elon Musk",TheComebackKid74,"Below is an excerpt from a news article. I'm hesitant to post any links on this story, because alot of people believe they were politically slanted when posting on a different sub.  After I explain the current news, below is a summary about TRI's present and future, dividend yield, how many consecutive raises and etc.  This is not intended to be a political post !

Thomson Reuters denied on Thursday accusations that the company was involved in ""large-scale social deception"" on behalf of the US government, saying the claims misrepresented its work with the Department of Defense.

On Wednesday, billionaire Elon Musk posted on X: “Reuters was paid millions of dollars by the US government for ‘large scale social deception.’ They’re a total scam.”

On Truth Social, US President Donald Trump echoed the claim, calling Reuters “Radical Left” and demanding that it “GIVE BACK THE MONEY, NOW!”

Thomson Reuters Special Services CEO Steve Rubley told CNN that “recent public discourse” has “inaccurately represented the nature of the business” between Thomson Reuters Special Services (TRSS) and the Department of Defense.

He added that the accusations wrongly conflated the Reuters news agency with TRSS, which are separate legal entities that operate “independently” and have separate boards of directors.

So basically Thomson Reuters news agency (ticker symbol TRI) and Thomson Reuters Special Services are two separate divisions. Both are owned by parent company Thomson Reuters Corp. TRI stock did not recieve any govt money and, this issue has nothing to with them. Still TRI's stock fell 3% this past Friday. This happened after the price just rallied to all time highs, after releasing earnings on Feb 6th. I belive it's reasonable to assume that the false allegations caused the share price drop this past Friday. Though I could be wrong, and this could be a pullback or a little of both. Even now TRI stock is still up 12% in the past 30 days.

Thomson Ruters (TRI) stock is viewed as a boring news stock. Yet it is actually a sleeper Tech stock, and one that pays a Dividend at that. TRI just raised their dividend by 10% after lastest earnings and has a current yield of 1.38%. They have also raised their dividend for 32 consecutive years. TRI will be moving to the Nasdaq and leaving the NYSE by approximately Feb 25th. TRI is one of the more solid dividend stocks that I have never seen mentioned on this sub. They serve the Law and Tax industry with generative AI software and applications. They also happen to invest up to 200 million a year into AI via Venture Captial. One of the 23 companies they invested was an AI company, and they later bought that company.

From this Stock Titan Article here ...

https://www.stocktitan.net/news/TRI/thomson-reuters-announces-new-150m-corporate-venture-capital-kgryjz8tu42j.html

Thomson Reuters (NYSE/TSX: TRI) has announced the launch of its second Corporate Venture Capital Fund, valued at $150 million. This new fund builds upon the success of its first $100 million fund launched in 2021. Operating as Thomson Reuters Ventures, Fund 2 will target Series A investments in early-stage technology companies across Legal Technology, Tax & Accounting, Fintech, Risk Fraud & Compliance, and News & Media markets.

The first fund has already made 23 investments, including Materia, an agentic AI company that was later acquired by Thomson Reuters. The new fund will maintain a focus on financial discipline and companies developing technologies addressing professional challenges, particularly in Gen AI applications. The initiative is part of Thomson Reuters' 'Build, Partner, Buy' strategy, aiming to strengthen its leadership position in professional technology solutions.

For those of you who only hold Index funds, mutual funds, Reits and etc. you are better off ignoring this. For those of you interested in a good growing stock that pays a Dividend, you might want to take a deeper look into TRI. TRI provides you significant growth potentia (imo), and at the same time offers dividend growth with 30+ years of consecutive raises.

This not finacial advise, please do your own Due Dillgence.

Back in 2017, DARPA identified social engineering hacks as a rising threat, and they shrewdly sought to develop counter measures include the concept of tools to detect such attempts and divert them to bots which could nullify them and potentially trace the source.

Part of the project was an open government tender to cyber security firms to serve as red team evaluators.  

TRSS Thompson Reuters Security Services is the cyber security company who won the bid.

Arguably, our government recognizing this threat and working on AI tools to decrease and prosecute it as far back as 2017 should be something we’re glad about.

Instead, the team of domestic enemies found this contract and headline and leapt to the dangerous and false conclusion there was something wrong with it.

Then they took their ignorant assumption and invented a hoax story of fraud and waste.  

Then their co-conspirators in one party took that hoax and embellished it further.

Sadly this exact same pattern has played out numerous times already during this cancerous initiative.

post,1gcjdqh,What’s the stock you’ll never sell,durustakta,"Our investment philosophy and goals usually depend on our age. You probably wouldn’t accept the same risk at 20 than at 60, especially if your stock portfolio is part of your retirement plan.

I agree with a value investing philosophy, so to me never selling implies the original investment thesis doesn’t change. 

I think we could have an interesting discussion if we share our age (or age range) and the company in which we trust for the rest of our lives (and why).

I’m in my 30s, so assuming I live for the next 50 years, I believe Lockheed Martin ($LMT) will remain an important player in the defense sector, as I expect war (mostly proxy wars) to continue being used for political interests and if the US DoD sees its budget reduced, our current Western society’s paradigm will be over.

Other candidates I’ve considered are Visa ($V), Microsoft ($MSFT) and Amazon ($AMZN), but I could see all those titans being disrupted someday in the next 50 years.

post,1ggjotg,Alphabet Deserves A Better Valuation,Fountainheadusa,"**I had recommended Alphabet (GOOG)** [**as a great long-term buy at $150**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anr3id/alphabet_goog_150_looks_like_an_excellent_long/), several months ago.

Last evening, Google knocked it out of the park with really stellar results. I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy.

I believe analysts’ consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins.

Google's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons.

* It has a near monopoly in Search
* Market leadership in media with YouTube.
* A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.
* A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS.

**Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.**

Let's take a closer look at Q3 earnings.

Q3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.**

Revenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%.

Consolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business.

Google Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads.

**Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.**

Google Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months.

Cloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more.

Based on consensus analysts’ estimates Alphabet’s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that’s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple‘s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google’s 22. Alphabet’s P/E is closer to the S&P 500’s P/E of 21!

I believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation.

Besides the strong EPS, a lot of Google’s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin.

The antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision.

post,1je3mot,Games Workshop Stock: Is Warhammer worth more than Star Wars when acquired by Disney?,JCRUZ_z,"This post is in relation to Games Workshop (LON: GAW), the \~£4.66 billion (\~$5.93B USD) tabletop gaming titan behind Warhammer.

My thesis: Warhammer’s universe, intellectual property (IP) and ecosystem are worth *more* than GAW’s current market cap *and* what Disney paid for Star Wars in 2012 ($4.05B, or $5.54B in 2025 dollars).

I know this might sound bold. One can say that Warhammer’s a niche , not a mainstream beast like Star Wars was. However, as someone that's been closely monitoring latest developments of Warhammer in social media and considering an almost 50 years of lore, a rabid fanbase, and catalysts like Henry Cavill’s Amazon series, this could be a sleeper hit the market’s undervaluing.

Let’s break it down.

GAW is the king of tabletop wargaming, crafting Warhammer universes—*40k* (grimdark sci-fi), *Age of Sigmar* (fantasy), and *The Old World* (retro fantasy). Founded in 1975 by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone with *Owl and Weasel*—a newsletter that became *White Dwarf* in 1977—it’s been building lore for 50 years. Today, it’s a £145/share stock with:

* **Market Cap**: £4.66B ($5.93B).
* **Revenue (2024)**: £577.5M ($735M), up 15.6% CAGR over 5 years.
* **Margins**: 71% gross, 41% operating, 30% net—insanely efficient.
* **Cash**: £125.8M, net debt negative (-£79.4M).
* **P/E**: 27.1—pricey, but growth justifies it.

Warhammer’s niche: 1-2M players dropping $200-500/year on minis, paints, and books. It’s not Disney’s scale, but it’s a moat—high-margin, loyal, and sticky.

# The Thesis: Warhammer’s IP is worth more than $5.9B (and Star Wars’ 2012 Price). GAW’s $5.9B cap reflects a tabletop business, but Warhammer’s IP (its lore, brand, and potential) could fetch $9-10B if sold to a Disney/Amazon/Netflix. (*)

*\[\*Edit: I am just trying to* ***value*** *WH's IP and $GAW, not saying I want it to be sold or anything.\]*

Why?

It’s a 50-year universe with untapped multimedia juice, and it’s firing on all cylinders in 2025. Let’s compare:

* **Disney’s Star Wars Deal**: $4.05B in 2012 ($5.54B today) got Lucasfilm—six films, $4.4B box office, $20B in merchandise, 35 years of lore. Disney turned it into $12B+ by 2024.
* **Warhammer Today**: No films (yet), but $735M revenue, 50 years of history and a lore deeper than Star Wars—10,000 years of *40k*, Chaos Gods, Space Marines, plus *Old World* nostalgia. Licensing’s just $38M—5% of revenue—but it’s a powder keg.

**Valuation Math**:

* Core revenue ($735M) x 8 (media IP multiple) = $5.88B.
* Licensing upside ($500M/year from films/TV, Star Wars-scale) x 5 = $2.5B.
* 50-year brand premium = $1-2B.
* **Total**: $9-10B—above GAW’s cap and Star Wars’ 2012 price.

Crazy? Maybe. But Warhammer’s fans are deep into it. Warhammer’s got potential.

# Why Now? 2025 is lighting up:

1. **Warhammer 40k 10th Edition**:
   * Launched June 2023, drove 10.8% core revenue growth in 2024 ($490M). Half-year to Dec 2024: 16.4% up ($307.5M).
   * X buzz (Q1 2025): “warhammer"" traffic’s 12-15M/month, up 10-20% from Q4 2024.
   * Potential: $75M/year growth through 2026.
2. **Henry Cavill’s Amazon Series**:
   * Deal locked Dec 2024: Cavill stars/produces a *40k* cinematic universe.
   * Licensing ($38M now) could double to $76M by 2027, with $40M+ indirect sales if 200K newbies buy armies.
3. **The Old World Resurgence**:
   * Jan 2024 launch, new faction drops (and rumours regarding Cathay).
   * People +30 are getting back to Warhammer. Veterans spending $50-250/army per year
4. **Hachette’s Combat Patrol**:
   * Launched Sept 2024 (UK), Jan 2025 (Spain via Salvat). Weekly mag with minis hooks newbies.
   * Launched in US too.

# Warhammer vs. Star Wars?

Warhammer’s no Star Wars, yet. Star Wars had mass appeal; Warhammer’s a cult with 1-2M players. But:

* **Lore**: 50 years, denser than Star Wars’ 35 in 2012. *Black Library* churns 20+ novels/year—*Horus Heresy* alone is 60+ books.
* **Fanbase**: Smaller but fanatic—players co-create (painting, campaigns). Star Wars sold toys; Warhammer sells a lifestyle.
* **Upside**: Star Wars had films in the can; Warhammer’s a blank slate. Cavill’s series could be its *Force Awakens*.

Some say Warhammer's too niche. I say it has a potential future mass craze.

$9-10B is what a buyer pays for potential, not just today’s market cap.

* **Now**: £145, P/E 27, 4.2% dividend yield. Fair value: £150-160 (EPS $5.35 to $6).
* **Bull Case**: Revenue hits $850M by 2027 (Cavill, *Old World*), EPS $9, P/E 25 = £225—50% upside.
* **Buyout**: A $9B bid spins the IP to Amazon, triples licensing in 5 years.

Risks? Cavill flops, *Old World* fades—growth slows to 5%, stock stalls at £150. But GAW’s 67% ROIC and monopoly scream resilience IMO.

comment,1je3mot,,,,,,,mifmsbd,thebeastiestmeat,"**BEAR CASE TO YOUR BULL CASE**

Realistically, i don't see anyone buying GAW for $9-$10 billion. In terms of return on investment it doesn't make sense. Right now GAW currently has an operating income of £200/$259 million. It would take 35 years for any ROI. Say with Disney's economies of scale, that drops to 25 years? Still too much. Disny bought Star Wars for just over $4 billion and disclosed it made $12 billion by the endo of 2023. That's an ROI of 200% (about 10% CAGR). All things being equal, Star Wars had a PE of about 4 at the time of acquisition (assuming \~$1 billion earnings per year). Even with all the new Warhammer things going on, what's their operating income in 3 years? $300? $350?

You can argue that Disney made $12 billion because of the strategy they implemented. But Warhammer is much more niche. How many people play Warhammer? 2 million? 5 million? Star Wars is one of the most popular franchises in the world. Jedi Fallen Order sold 10 million copies. The Force Awaken is the 5th highest grossing movie of all time. No way does Disney spend more money or even the same amount, on Warhammer simply because Warhammer will never generate the same amount of money anually.

Star Wars \~ $1billion/year

Warhammer \~$250million/year

Even if Disney buys Warhammer at $4b market price (which it won't) they'll have to at least quadrouple the income it generates for the investment to make sense. At best, Disney buys it for $2.5 billion. As far as growing the franchise, it's risky. Disney has to invest a lot of money behind movies, games, etc. The Force Awakens cost Disney 500 million to make and generated 2 billion in sales. Is there a world where that happens for Warhammer? No way. Never. Disney won't pour half a billion into a movie that isn't a huge franchise with guaranteed sales. Disney is just too big of a company to take risks like that. Warhammer just doesn't have the same fan base and it isn't even close. It's safe to assume that Disney's investment behind the world building in Warhammer will be substantially smaller than Star Wars. Therefore Star Wars is worth much more than Warhammer.

post,1h6pcon,"Intel’s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk",JRshoe1997,"Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever.

Gelsinger’s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan’s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself.

Yes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn’t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses.

But ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds.

“They just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,” explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. “So that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.”

In other words, there’s no easy path forward for the US’s largest homegrown chip builder.

The Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger’s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world.

Gelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems.

Lack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn’t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn’t ideal.

Gelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel’s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel’s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger.

“Some of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,” said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell.

“Gelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.”

Now Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger’s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department

Under the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it’s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can’t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can’t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money.

But moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult.

“I think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,” explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. “So how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?”

If Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses.

“You'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,” Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. “So, I think you just need to scrap it. Take your lumps. If you have to, return the money to the government.”

While Danely believes Intel should drop its goal of serving as a global foundry for other companies, he says it should continue to build its own chips.

“I still think they should manufacture their own CPUs,” he explained. ""There's been speculation for a long time that they're just going to turn the keys over to [TSMC] and have [TSMC] make everything. We don't think that that's the right move.”

Before that, however, Intel needs to find a new permanent CEO.

post,1jqgunf,Why a China–Korea–Japan Free Trade Deal Would Be a Huge Win for BYD,likemastatus,"TL;DR: A tri-nation FTA would give BYD cheaper access to two lucrative markets, fortify its supply chain, and encourage more partnership with top-tier Japanese and Korean firms. All that translates to faster growth and possibly fatter profits for BYD. It’s the kind of macro tailwind that could make BYD’s ambitious global goals (like that 800k overseas sales target) even more achievable. As a BYD enthusiast, I’d be very excited to see this free trade deal happen – it could be a sleeper catalyst for BYD’s stock in the long run.

 So let's talk BYD and free trade. Imagine China, South Korea, and Japan sign a free trade agreement (FTA) – no tariffs, smoother trade, tighter supply chains. As a long-time BYD watcher, I genuinely think BYD would love this scenario. Here’s my take on why BYD could be one of the biggest beneficiaries:

More BYDs on Korean and Japanese Roads

Improved export access = more sales. BYD has been aggressively expanding into both Japan and South Korea, and an FTA would throw the doors wide open. In Japan, BYD only entered in 2023 and sold 2,223 EVs in 2024 – surprisingly surpassing Toyota’s EV sales (2,038 units) in their own home market​. That’s a tiny fraction of Japan’s ~4 million annual auto sales, but it shows BYD’s potential. They’re so bullish that they plan to open 100 dealerships in Japan by 2025​. Now, picture those BYD showrooms if exports face zero trade barriers. Japanese EV adoption is just getting started (EVs were <2% of Japan’s auto sales in 2024​), so easier access could let BYD ride the coming wave as Japan catches up on electrification.

In South Korea, BYD is also making moves. They just launched models like the Dolphin hatchback (aka Atto 3) and Seal sedan in early 2025 with aggressive pricing (around $21k) aimed at undercutting Hyundai and Kia​. BYD literally said they’re in Korea “for the long haul” and will start with affordable EVs to gain a foothold​ chosun.comThe Korean EV market is growing (about 99,000 EVs sold in 2024, ~6% of total car sales​), and Korean consumers have shown they’ll buy foreign EVs if the deal is good – Tesla’s sales in Korea jumped 548% last year to nearly 30k units wants a piece of that action, and a tri-nation FTA would only accelerate this. With freer trade, exporting more vehicles into Korea and Japan becomes simpler and cheaper, allowing BYD to scale up dealerships and marketing without so much red tape.

Let’s not forget BYD’s broader global push: the company is already on fire overseas. In the first quarter of 2025, BYD’s overseas sales doubled, topping 206,000 NEVs (EVs + plug-in hybrids) sold outside China through March​. They’re aiming for 800,000 overseas sales in 2025, roughly double 2024’s level​. Gaining frictionless access to nearby wealthy markets like Japan and Korea could add significant volume on top of BYD’s growth in Europe, Latin America, etc. It’s basically low-hanging fruit next door. As one Reuters analysis noted, BYD sees “great opportunities” in markets friendly to Chinese EVs​ – and an FTA would make Japan/Korea way more friendly by default.

Tariff-Free = Cheaper EVs (or Better Margins)

One immediate benefit of a free trade pact would be zero tariffs on cars and batteries moving between the three countries. This is huge for BYD. Right now, importing cars into South Korea incurs an 8% tariff, which BYD has even been absorbing itself to keep prices low​ (Talk about commitment – BYD literally ate the 8% tax just so Korean buyers wouldn’t feel it, making their EVs more competitively priced!). If a China-Korea FTA scrapped that duty, BYD could either drop prices further (boosting demand) or stop sacrificing that 8% off their margins. Either way, BYD wins.

In Japan, auto import tariffs are already pretty low (Japan has prided itself on open auto markets in terms of tariffs​). But an FTA would lock in zero tariffs on EVs and also likely cut duties on EV components. Think about batteries, for example. BYD not only makes cars but is a major battery producer; under free trade, shipping BYD’s batteries or battery cells to partners in Japan/Korea would be cheaper. Likewise, any high-tech parts BYD imports from Japan/Korea for its cars (semiconductors, camera systems, etc.) would drop in cost. It’s a supply chain cost advantage on both ends.

Crucially, a tri-country FTA would shield BYD from the kind of tariff threats popping up in the West. Europe has been mulling tariffs on Chinese EVs, and the U.S. has been generally hostile with trade barriers. BYD’s chairman has openly discussed how tariffs abroad are a concern and said BYD might respond by assembling cars locally to “overcome tariffs” in those regions​. But if China, Japan, and Korea are freely trading, BYD doesn’t need costly local factories or workarounds for those markets – they can ship finished cars directly. No 10% EU tariff equivalent, no Trump-style surprises. Just sell the car and bank the revenue. This kind of stable, tariff-free access would make Japan and Korea very attractive markets for BYD to focus on, since their cost advantage would fully translate to showroom prices. One Bloomberg piece even noted BYD’s $21k starting price in Korea undercuts local EVs by being so low​– remove tariffs and BYD could sustain such aggressive pricing more profitably.

Bottom line: lower tariffs = lower prices = more competitive BYD EVs. Given BYD’s strength is value-for-money, an FTA turbocharges that advantage in Japan and Korea.

Stronger East Asian EV Supply Chains

BYD isn’t just a carmaker; they’re an integrated EV supply chain beast (batteries, electronics, you name it). A free trade agreement would knit China, Japan, and South Korea’s industries closer, which plays right into BYD’s hands. These three countries combined account for nearly 40% of global manufacturing output, including dominating sectors like semiconductors, EVs, and batteries​. In other words, East Asia is already the powerhouse of the EV world – and BYD is a major player in that powerhouse. If trade barriers drop, it becomes a lot easier to source the best components regionally and optimize costs.

For instance, Japan and South Korea are leaders in certain EV components: think of Japan’s electronics (chips from Renesas, sensors from Denso) or Korea’s advanced battery materials and displays. Under an FTA, BYD could import high-tech parts from Japanese and Korean suppliers tariff-free and likely faster. That means BYD’s cars can benefit from top-notch components at lower cost. Similarly, BYD could export its own components to partners in those countries. Perhaps Japanese automakers might buy BYD’s affordable batteries (BYD’s blade battery tech is world-class), or Korean firms could source BYD’s EV semiconductors or motors. With fewer trade frictions, a more efficient regional EV supply chain forms, and BYD can slot right into it as both supplier and assembler.

We’re already seeing hints of such collaboration. All three governments have talked about strengthening supply chain cooperation in high-tech sectors as part of improving trilateral trade ties​. For example, South Korea and Japan want reliable access to China’s rare earths and battery materials, while China wants chips from Japan/Korea​. EVs benefit directly from this kind of exchange: BYD needs advanced chips (which Japan/Korea excel at), and Japanese/Korean automakers need battery tech (which BYD offers). A freer trade environment makes these exchanges smoother and less politically fraught.

One likely focus area is EV battery supply chains. Batteries often have materials crisscrossing borders (lithium processed in China, cells made in Korea, etc.). With an FTA, these materials and parts could move across China, Japan, and Korea with minimal hassle, lowering the cost to build each battery pack. BYD’s cars – and also its battery sales to other OEMs – would get a cost edge from that. In a sense, the FTA could encourage a regional EV “ecosystem” where each country specializes a bit (China mass-produces, Japan provides precision components, Korea contributes tech and refinement) to collectively take on Western competitors. BYD, given its scale and vertical integration, would be in a prime spot to orchestrate and benefit from this synergy.

Tech Partnerships & Investments: BYD + Japan/Korea = 💕

Perhaps the most exciting (and underrated) benefit: a free trade deal would likely foster more tech collaboration and cross-investment between companies in China, Japan, and Korea – which could hugely aid BYD. Free trade isn’t just about goods; it builds trust and business ties. And when borders are more open, big players tend to team up rather than reinvent the wheel.

BYD’s already got notable friends in Japan/Korea. Case in point: Toyota. The Japanese giant struck a joint venture with BYD to co-develop electric cars, pooling their R&D talent. Engineers from both companies are literally working under one roof to “develop BEVs that are superior in performance... by merging the two companies’ strengths,” as the JV’s CEO put it​. This kind of partnership was once unthinkable – a top Japanese automaker relying on a Chinese firm’s EV tech – but BYD’s expertise (especially in batteries) made it happen. An FTA would likely encourage more partnerships like Toyota-BYD, by assuring Japanese and Korean firms that cooperation with Chinese companies is a safe, long-term bet (no sudden trade wars to wreck the venture). We could envision, say, Honda or Nissan collaborating with BYD on battery supply, or Korean firms like Samsung expanding their investment in BYD.

Speaking of Samsung – they actually invested $450 million in BYD a few years back​, taking a small stake to cooperate on electric car chips and batteries. That’s a Korean electronics titan effectively betting on BYD’s auto future. Similarly, there are reports of other tech exchanges (for example, rumors that BYD might supply batteries to certain Japanese EV projects, etc.). If China/Japan/Korea enter a free trade framework, it lowers the political risk of such deals and likely removes caps or hassles on cross-border investments. BYD could more easily attract capital or partnerships from say, a SoftBank or a Hyundai Mobis, who might want exposure to its EV battery business or its fast-growing EV lineup.

For BYD, more collaboration means faster innovation and market penetration. Partnering with established Japanese and Korean players can help BYD improve its tech (imagine BYD using Sony sensors or Samsung displays in its cars seamlessly) and also gain local market insights. It’s a two-way street: those partners get BYD’s cost-efficient tech, and BYD gains credibility and technical refinement. A trade deal acting as a green light for such tie-ups is a big strategic win for BYD’s long-term growth. As a cherry on top, freer investment flows might even allow BYD to set up joint factories or R&D centers in Japan/Korea down the line, further ingraining them in those markets (and creating jobs there, which governments love).

The Long-Term Growth Boost

Tie it all together, and BYD stands to gain on multiple fronts: more sales opportunities, lower costs, stronger tech, and bigger allies. In a business as globally competitive as electric vehicles, those advantages can be game-changing. BYD is already the world’s largest EV maker by volume, and it’s hungry for global market share. A China-Korea-Japan FTA would effectively hand BYD a “home field” advantage across East Asia – a region with huge car markets and tech resources. It’s no surprise analysts are buzzing about East Asian economic cooperation. These three countries combined are an economic juggernaut (quarter of global GDP) with massive auto industry clout​.

If they tear down trade barriers among themselves, companies like BYD that can integrate across borders will be in pole position.

From an investor’s perspective, this kind of free trade pact would make the bull case for BYD’s international expansion even stronger. It de-risks their Asia expansion and could add a few percentage points to profit margins on each car sold in Japan/Korea (thanks to tariff removal and supply chain efficiencies). It also signals that major governments in the region are supportive of EV industry growth via cooperation, not protectionism – which bodes well for BYD not getting shut out. Remember, a rising tide lifts all boats: BYD’s success in Japan and Korea could also positively pressure local rivals to step up, expanding the overall EV market pie (which BYD gets a slice of).",2025-04-03 12:15:28,52.0,32.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqgunf/why_a_chinakoreajapan_free_trade_deal_would_be_a/,stocks

comment,1jqgunf,,,,,,,ml82ttl,DOE_ZELF_NORMAAL,"Alright, let’s play devil’s advocate here—because while the free trade utopia sounds lovely on paper, reality has a way of throwing wrenches into the gears.

First off, Japan and Korea aren’t just passive consumers waiting for Chinese EVs to flood in. They’ve got their own national champions—Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Kia—with deep political connections and heavy domestic lobbying power. Think those guys are going to roll out the red carpet for BYD to eat their lunch? Not a chance. A full-blown FTA would have to survive that resistance, and even if it passed, don’t underestimate how non-tariff barriers (regulations, inspections, local content rules) can still be used to slow down foreign competition.

Second, the idea that a free trade deal would “lock in” friendly market access is…optimistic. Trade deals can be revised, paused, or sidestepped when politics shift (ask the UK how stable these things are). And with geopolitical tensions constantly simmering—China’s stance on Taiwan, South Korea’s alliance with the U.S., Japan’s own security concerns—this kind of deep economic integration isn’t exactly frictionless. If Beijing sneezes the wrong way, Seoul and Tokyo might catch a cold and slam the brakes on cooperation.

Third, BYD’s success abroad isn’t just about tariffs—it’s about perception. Japanese and Korean consumers are notoriously brand-loyal and skeptical of foreign newcomers, especially from China. Even with a cost advantage, BYD still faces uphill battles in trust, branding, and service infrastructure. Tesla barely cracked those markets—and that’s Tesla. BYD isn’t just going to steamroll in because of a few percentage points of tariff relief.

And let’s be real: the FTA dream is years away if it ever happens. These countries have been talking about a trilateral deal for over a decade with little progress. The economic benefits are clear, but the political will? Not so much.

post,1f4vsv5,Alibaba shares jump after it completes three-year regulatory overhaul ,Puginator,"Alibaba has completed a three-year regulatory “rectification” process following an antitrust fine it received on charges of monopolistic practices in 2021, China’s market regulator said on Friday.

Shares of Alibaba rose more than 3% in Friday morning trading.

On Friday, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said that, over the past few years, it has been supervising Alibaba’s process to become compliant with antitrust regulations. The rectification work has achieved “good results,” the SAMR said, according to a Google-translated statement.

In 2021, China’s SAMR fined Alibaba 18.23 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) as part of an anti-monopoly investigation into the tech giant. The regulator’s focus was on a practice that forces merchants to choose one of two e-commerce platforms, rather than being able to work with both.

At the time, the regulator said that the “choose one” policy and others allowed Alibaba to bolster its position in the market and gain unfair competitive advantages.

Since that fine, the SAMR has been supervising Alibaba as it gets in line with the regulator’s requirements. Alibaba has now completed this process and has stopped the ”‘choose one of two’ monopoly behavior,” the SAMR said Friday.

The SAMR said it will now guide Alibaba to continue to improve its compliance and efficiency and to accelerate innovation.

The conclusion of the regulatory overhaul will help put one of Alibaba’s worst run-ins with Beijing behind it. Jefferies analysts said in a note on Friday that the conclusion of the regulatory process was a “positive” for the company, which “highlights this is a new start and ensures compliance in operations.”

But the regulator’s announcement could also signal the ongoing softening stance from Chinese regulators towards private technology firms, following an intense crackdown that began at the end of 2020. At the time, Beijing enacted several regulations and moves that aimed to restrict the power of domestic technology firms in areas ranging from antitrust to gaming.

The empire of Alibaba founder Jack Ma has been in the spotlight over the past few years since regulators axed the IPO of his financial technology firm Ant Group in 2020. Ant Group itself also underwent a regulator-supervised rectification process, with most of the major issues resolved by last year.

Regulatory concerns have been an overhang on the Alibaba stock, which has fallen more than 70% from its peak in 2020. More recently, the company has been dealing with slow growth amid rising competition in the e-commerce space in China, as well as contending with a cautious Chinese consumer.

The tech titan showed early signs of a recovery in the June quarter, as cloud computing revenue reaccelerated and transactions via its e-commerce platforms looked healthy.

post,1i82fl0,Apple and Google's massive mobile empires face dual UK antitrust probes,Puginator,"Britain’s competition regulator on Thursday launched an investigation into Apple and Google’s huge mobile ecosystems to determine whether the tech titans are in breach of the U.K.’s strict new digital competition rules.

The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said it was opening dual probes into both U.S. tech giants to assess whether they hold “strategic market status” in their respective mobile ecosystems, including operating systems, app stores and smartphone-based browsers.

The investigations will “explore the impact on people who use mobile devices and the thousands of businesses developing innovative services or content such as apps for these devices,” the CMA said.

“Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish,” an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. “We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.”

“In the U.K. alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform,” the Apple spokesperson added. “We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.”

Google was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

New powers

The CMA now has enhanced regulatory powers after a new U.K. law, called the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, or DMCC, came into effect at the start of this year.

The DMCC seeks to prevent anti-competitive behavior in digital markets. It can designate large companies that have a significant amount of market power in a certain digital activity as having “strategic market status.”

The CMA now has the power to impose changes to prevent potential anti-competitive behavior from any firm that is given strategic market status.

According to the regulator, virtually all mobile devices sold in the U.K. are pre-installed with either Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android operating systems, and their app stores and browsers have either exclusive or leading positions on their platforms compare to alternative products and services.

Almost all (94%) of people aged 16 or above — about 56 million consumers — in the U.K. currently have access to a smartphone and the average Brit spends around three hours a day using a mobile device, the CMA added.

The body said it would examine three key issues, including the extent of competition between Apple and Google’s mobile ecosystems, possible leveraging of the tech giants’ market power into other activities and potential exploitative conduct.

“More competitive mobile ecosystems could foster new innovations and new opportunities across a range of services that millions of people use, be they app stores, browsers or operating systems,” Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA, said in a statement Thursday.

“Better competition could also boost growth here in the UK, with businesses able to offer new and innovative types of products and services on Apple’s and Google’s platforms,” Cardell added.

post,1imlpph,Why are technology stocks so popular?,Responsible_Ease_262,"Earnings? Growth? 

The Magnificent Seven is made up of information technology or information technology driven companies.

But what were the innovations that got us there?

1. Information Theory. The foundational work of Claude Shannon in the late 1930’s helped the Allies win WW2 and kickstarted the Information Age. 

2. Quantum Physics. This led to the development of materials used in electronics including:

3. The Transistor. Miniature semiconductors like the transistor were used to create logic circuits in computers. 

4. The Integrated Circuit. Numerous semiconductors and other components could be created on silicon “chips”.

5. The Microprocessor. An integrated circuit that could be programmed and used in computers and control systems. 

One common thread of the MAG 7 is that they were the companies that were the “first with the most” in innovation and disruption. 

So, what factor will predict the rise of the next tech titans?

comment,1imlpph,,,,,,,mc7amm1,banditcleaner2,"A couple reasons:

1. Software is significantly more scalable without much rise in costs. Data centers and servers do not cost that much to operate, but are both high profit margin for the companies that host them as well as the companies that use them to host software, since software is much easier to scale. It's a lot easier to sell an iphone app to hundreds of thousands or even millions of users then it is to sell a physical product to hundreds of thousands or millions of buyers.

2. Most of the major innovations going forward will almost be guaranteed to come from tech. Tech is also used everywhere - software makes manufacturing more efficient, it makes education more efficient, it makes healthcare more efficient, it makes entertainment more accessible, it makes defense more resilient, etc. 

3. Tech is not ever really moving backwards. We're not about to abandon cars in favor of horses. We're not about to abandon computers in favor of abacus'. We're certainly not about to abandon software in return for doing calculations by hand. Tech continuously will always keep building upon previous foundations. Not having to reinvent the computer means we can invent AI. Eventually not having to reinvent AI means we can invent AGI, and it will only ever move forward as new inventions are made.

Now that's not to say that we can't invent useless apps. Toothbrushes that have AI that tell you where you missed in your mouth is probably not a product that is really necessary. Having an app for literally everything is probably not ideal. But the real innovations in the world will be tech-adjacent in some way. Pharmaceutical companies that invent new medicines are using technology to do so. Mathematicians and scientists that discover new theorems or proofs are using computers to help them even if the computer themselves aren't doing the main intelligent thinking.",2025-02-11 16:08:48,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1imlpph/why_are_technology_stocks_so_popular/,stocks

Arcutis Biotherapeutics (ARQT) has recently achieved significant milestones that may positively influence its stock performance.

The company has reported positive outcomes from multiple Phase 3 trials for its flagship product, Zoryve (roflumilast) cream. Notably, the INTEGUMENT-PED trial demonstrated that 25.4% of children aged 2 to 5 with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis achieved treatment success at Week 4, compared to 10.7% with the vehicle, with significant improvements observed as early as Week 1.  ￼ ￼

Building on these results, Arcutis submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Zoryve cream 0.05% for the treatment of children aged 2 to 5 with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. The FDA has accepted this application, indicating progress toward potential approval.  ￼

Additionally, Arcutis and Padagis have agreed to stay their ongoing patent litigation regarding Zoryve cream 0.3%. This strategic move is intended to protect Arcutis’ intellectual property and preserve market exclusivity, which could have favorable implications for the company’s market position.  ￼ ￼

These developments suggest that Arcutis is advancing its clinical and regulatory objectives, which may enhance its market performance.

post,1dv8hml,SoftBank stock hits its first record high in 24 years — Arm and AI helped it get there  ,Puginator,"SoftBank Group shares hit a record high on Thursday, just as the company’s massive tech investment arm shows signs of recovery and its outspoken founder Masayoshi Son emerged back into the public spotlight to align the Japanese giant to a future in artificial intelligence.

The firm has also been helped by the public market success of British chip designer Arm, in which Softbank has a majority stake.

Shares of the Japanese giant closed at a record high of 11,190.00 Japanese yen on Thursday — a far cry from the dotcom crash of the early 2000s and a more recent downturn for the company during the tech market troubles of 2021 and 2022.

SoftBank’s journey to the peak

Son founded SoftBank in 1981, back when the company distributed software. It went public in Japan in 1994, and, amid the internet boom, made a $2 million investment in Yahoo in the middle of that decade.

That started off the company’s tech investments.

The rise of the internet and of Yahoo pushed SoftBank’s stock to a peak closing price of 10,111.1 yen on Feb. 18, 2000. Three days prior, the firm’s shares had hit an intraday high of 11,000 yen.

As internet stocks came crashing down, so too did SoftBank’s share price, which at one point sank more than 90% below its dotcom peak.

It wasn’t until nearly 21 years later, on Feb. 16, 2021, that SoftBank exceeded its previous record-high close.

Vision Fund

The recent rise to a share price peak has been volatile since Son positioned SoftBank as a visionary pioneer with the 2017 launch of a massive technology investment arm — the Vision Fund.

SoftBank made dozens of bets on tech companies across the world, some of which turned sour. Office sharing startup WeWork was perhaps among the highest-profile names. But some of SoftBank’s investments in Chinese firms also took a hit after Beijing kicked off its crackdown on the domestic tech sector at the end of 2020.

After lingering near then-record highs in March 2021, SoftBank’s stock fell sharply, alongside other global tech stocks. The Vision Fund posted then-record financial losses in 2022. Son said that SoftBank would go into “defense” mode and be more conservative with its investments. He changed tack shortly after the Vision Fund posted a record $32 billion loss in 2023, saying that the company would now shift into “offense,” because he was excited about the investment opportunities in AI.

SoftBank’s share price began a recovery from around May 2023, and the Japanese titan’s Vision Fund more recently posted better financials amid broader tech stock recoveries.

“Softbank Vision Fund had to write down various investments due to a combination of equity values declining and a tougher private financing environment. It looks like the write down cycle is mostly done, and there is a good chance that the IPO market will be more constructive going forward, especially for AI related investments,” Oliver Matthew, head of Asian consumer research at CLSA, told CNBC by email.

Arm chip boost

Several analysts attributed SoftBank’s recent share price bump of around 78% in the year to date to the IPO success of Arm, which it acquired in 2016.

SoftBank owns roughly 90% of Arm even after the listing. Arm shares are up nearly 124% alone this year, as of the close on July 3.

“SoftBank Group’s investment strategy and focus has long included the development of an AI ecosystem portfolio, long before the LLM (large language model)-driven bull cycle in AI-related names over the last 18 months or so,” Paul Golding, senior U.S. lifestyle and payments analyst at Macquarie U.S. equity research, told CNBC by email.

“This vision, in our view, likely drove some of the investment decision in 2016 to acquire Arm, giving SoftBank Group direct exposure to semiconductor market dynamics and ownership of intellectual property around semiconductor design well ahead of broader progress in AI use-cases and platforms.”

SoftBank shares “have been benefitting from this vis-à-vis well-publicized” uses for Arm intellectual property, such as in the automotive industry or cloud data center, Golding added.

Do investors believe the SoftBank story?

Over the years, investors have focused on whether SoftBank Group’s valuation fairly reflects the assets it is invested in or holds.

For example, SoftBank’s valuation is around $101.5 billion. Arm’s market capitalization is around $176 billion — meaning that SoftBank’s 90% stake is equivalent to about $158 billion of that figure. That alone is significantly above SoftBank Group’s overall valuation, without taking into account the company’s other holdings and businesses, such as its telecommunications arm.

Analysts cite this as a reason why SoftBank’s share price does not reflect its fair value.

Dan Baker, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said a lot of SoftBank’s price appreciation comes down to Arm.

“I’m not sure that investors are convinced by the SoftBank story again,” Baker told CNBC by email, adding that this year’s share gain is “primarily” because Arm stock has risen, while the Japanese yen has weakened. Baker said it is worth looking at the so-called sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation, which ascribes value to the various parts of SoftBank’s holdings to figure what the company is worth. Baker said the SOTP valuation remains just under 50% this year, meaning SoftBank’s stock does not truly reflect the value of its various businesses and investments.

“So I’m not sure that investors are ‘buying the SoftBank story’ but investors are certainly buying the ARM story,” Baker said.

Investors have also cheered the fact that SoftBank has sold practically all of its shares in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant that Son backed in 2000.

SoftBank has also likely been helped by a recent broader rise in Japanese stocks, with the Nikkei 225 Index up 22% this year alone as of Thursday.

Artificial super intelligence

But can Son’s focus on AI boost SoftBank’s value further and close the discount to its basket of assets?

The SoftBank founder, who has been out of the public spotlight in the last year, recently spoke about his excitement over the future of AI and how SoftBank can be at the center of this technology with its investment in companies like Arm.

Son last month laid out his vision for a world featuring what he dubbed as artificial super intelligence, or ASI, which would be 10,000 times smarter than humans.

It comes at a time when investors are feverishly looking at how to play the AI boom, with the parabolic rise of Nvidia’s stock price underscoring the excitement around the technology.

CLSA’s Matthew said SoftBank’s discount could reduce, going forward, thanks to some of the company’s early AI investments.

“Softbank has been absolutely consistent about its investment direction; they were among the earliest investors behind the AI theme, and in some ways too early so many investors thought they were overpaying, or buying into certain companies where it wasn’t clear how AI was related,” Matthew said.

“As a result, Softbank Group shares trade at a surprisingly wide discount to its fair value, and we believe this discount will narrow in the future.”

You’re on the /r/Stocks subreddit, if you see no value in picking individual stocks, you’re in the wrong place.  2. The purpose of buybacks are generally not to cash in on a low valuation, but a tool to redistribute profits. In the case of SoftBank, the potential profits are not yet realized, hence the speculation portion of the post.  3. Nvidia is not the only listed company with “pricing power”. It’s an odd comparison but let’s consider it. ARM currently holds a near monopoly of commercial processor architecture with no competition in sight, while nvidia has a current market lead in its own field but with wealthy potential competitors edging closer each day. In my view, based on current offerings and competitors, ARM is more likely to retain their monopoly in the long run, and is much less reliant on the success of AI",2024-07-04 22:26:35,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dv8hml/softbank_stock_hits_its_first_record_high_in_24/,stocks

post,1e5ds72,Am I missing something?,MutedFly2034,"I was researching the difference between total outstanding shares vs float, and apparently most companies do not exclude instituional shares from float because they are traded on exchanges as well. My example is Apple, which despite having 57.59% institutionally owned shares its float is 15.31b of its 15.33b shares. What I don’t understand, however, is how it says 5.22% of shares are owned by insiders, which I thought was not included in public float calculation. However the float is 99.8%, not 94.78% or whatever; so clearly at least the vast majority of these shares are counted. Is it only certain restricted shares that are not counted? Also the only article I could really find on this on titan.com said some companies calculate institutional shares as part of public float, some don’t. Are there any examples of some that don’t? Thanks in advance.

That's because ""public float calculation"" isn't really a thing used in finance or valuation -- largely because it's unimportant and has no bearing on future returns on risked capital.

> Is it only certain restricted shares that are not counted?

I'd imagine any delta relates to employer stock comp matching (or RSUs and / or PSUs, potentially) that hasn't vested yet.

>Also the only article I could really find on this on titan.com said some companies calculate institutional shares as part of public float, some don’t. 

Again, that's because the notion of ""float"" is meaningless in the context of maximizing returns, outside of suuuper thinly traded OTC securities",2024-07-17 17:50:37,4.0,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1e5ds72/am_i_missing_something/,stocks
