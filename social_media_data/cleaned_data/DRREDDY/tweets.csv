Energised by the engagement of colleagues and led by our Management Council, we came together to take stock of the last quarter and our strategic priorities for the months ahead. A key highlight was celebrating colleagues who give back to society – a standing ovation to colleagues who have juggled their multiple roles and priorities, and volunteered their time and skills selflessly to serve those less fortunate than them. A highly motivating note on which to go into our last quarter of FY’25.

Profit After Tax (PAT) was affected by one-offs related to Nicotinell acquisition costs, the JV minority interest, changes in land tax laws, etc. Two important moves in the quarter – closure of our deal to acquire the market-leading global brand Nicotinell and the related portfolio as part of our global consumer health business, and operationalisation of our Joint Venture with Nestlé India to take science-based nutraceutical products to consumers in India. Both moves are aimed at meeting unmet consumer needs. Watch our CEO, Erez Israeli, on these topics in this interview: https://t.co/dqw2fylTXA

Our CEO, Erez Israeli, described highlights of what was a good quarter with key developments - closure of our acquisition of Nicotinell and related brands as part of our global consumer health focus, operationalisation of our joint venture with Nestlé India, continued progress on key products, and strategic collaborations. We recently received a non-exclusive Voluntary Licence from Gilead Sciences for the anti-retroviral drug, Lenacapavir. Our CEO - API & Services, Deepak Sapra, spoke about its potential to eliminate the threat of HIV, and our aim to expand access to this novel drug in countries with high disease burden. Our success as a partner of choice for this drug was based on our capabilities in science and manufacturing, and our commitment to providing access to innovative drugs. We currently serve over 700 million patients around the world and aim to reach over 1.5 billion patients by 2030. Our Co-Chairman and MD, Prasad G V, highlighted and celebrated achievements that speak to our core tenets – recent wins in the marketplace that made a difference to patients, demonstrated our capabilities in deep science, and delivered meaningful growth. He also spoke about continued effort to shape our culture to enables such wins, including continuous learning and improvement. The townhall closed on an inspiring note - our colleague, Obiageri Amaechi, associate product manager based in our New Jersey office described her experience representing Nigeria in Women’s Discus Throw at the 2024 Paris Olympics! We are proud and inspired by Obi’s journey, and her passion in equal measure for sporting excellence and access to healthcare. We also heard from Mark Jones, one of the newest members of the Dr. Reddy’s family and Head of Supply Chain for the recently-acquired Nicotinell business as part of global consumer health. Mark described his recent participation in the ICLA 2024 European Sailing Championships in Portugal, proudly donning the Dr. Reddy’s ‘Good Health Can’t Wait’ shirt through the event! What's more, having acquired trusted vaccine brands from Sanofi India recently, we also conducted a health camp offering to administer the flu vaccine to our colleagues and their family members. Indeed, a highly motivating note to recharge us physically and emotionally for H2 FY’25!

In the lively Q&A that followed, questions to the Management Council ranged from affordability and access to productivity, operations and strategy. As always, our townhall was accompanied by a display of our products and initiatives – Xlabs, our ideation and innovation workspace; sustainable superfoods and sustainably sourced lifestyle products; key OTC products; and volunteering opportunities for colleagues!

We recently announced our Q3 FY’24 results. Another quarter of highest-ever revenue and robust performance was led by our generics business in the U.S. and Europe helped by improvement in base business performance and new launches. While price erosion will continue to be present in varying degrees in the U.S. given the nature of the business model, the pick-up of market share in the base products, attention to security of supply and logistics, ability to create stock and raise servicing quality in the U.S. have helped us counter it. Overall, we continue to invest in generics, biologics/biosimilars, and innovative products. Hear our CEO Erez Israeli explain more about our business performance. As we enjoy another record revenue this quarter, Erez explains our strategy for consistent performance to continue our long-term aspiration of double-digit growth, 25% EBITDA and 25% ROCE.
