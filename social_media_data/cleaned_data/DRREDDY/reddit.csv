post,1giabtf,Dr. Reddy's Named by Science Magazine in Top 20 Global Pharma Employers List for Third Consecutive Year (BSE: DRREDDY),MarketNewsFlow,"Original Link: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dr-reddys-named-science-magazine-114000953.html

Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. (""Dr. Reddy’s"") has been ranked among the top employers according to the 2024 Top Biotech and Pharma Employers Survey conducted by _Science_.

This marks the third consecutive appearance of Dr. Reddy’s in the list. In 2022, Dr. Reddy’s entered the prestigious list at rank 18. In 2023, the company was placed at number 16. In the latest 2024 rankings, Dr. Reddy’s is placed at number 15 with high scores in ‘Employee Respect’, ‘Employee Loyalty’ and ‘Social Responsibility’. The full list is available here:

The prestigious _Science_ magazine is a U.S.-based peer-reviewed academic journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and one of the world's top academic journals. Since 2002, _Science_ magazine has evaluated top organizations in biotech, pharma, and biopharma through its Top Employers Survey. The _Science_ and _Science Careers_’ 2024 Top Employers Survey polled employees in biotechnology, biopharmaceutical, pharmaceutical, and related industries to determine the 20 best employers as well as their driving characteristics. Respondents to the web-based survey were asked to rate companies based on 24 characteristics, including innovative leadership, respect for employees, and social responsibility. The findings are based on approximately 6,400 completed surveys from readers of _Science_, and other survey invitees.

Commenting on the recognition, **G.V. Prasad, Co-Chairman and Managing Director of Dr. Reddy’s** said, ""We stand for developing affordable and innovative pharmaceuticals by investing in cutting-edge science and technology, developing great scientists and creating an environment that nurtures innovation in all aspects of product development. Our colleagues have the freedom to pursue multiple career tracks within the organization and we expose them to the best ideas and knowledge in whatever field they choose to work in. Our culture and identity have revolved around being bold, entrepreneurial, responsible, humble, empathetic. Our purpose of ‘Good Health Can’t Wait’ is a movement and call to action for all of us, and good health encompasses patients, people and planet. The opportunity is available to each colleague to do their life’s work at our company and make the world a better place. Our people are our pride, and nothing gives us more joy than to see our people realize their full potential in the company.""

A recent report by the Foundation for Advancing Science and Technology (FAST India) in collaboration with IIFL Securities on ‘State of Industry R&D in India’ ranked Dr. Reddy’s first among Indian pharma companies in both R&D intensity and the proportion of PhD employees1.

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1hj8g72,Market records biggest weekly fall in more than 2 years; which sector performed well??,ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/n41tildiy68e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71eaafcf2e4ad19b7bd0956a16afe6f9dba45e4d

The Indian markets saw their biggest weekly drop in over two years, with the Sensex falling 4.98% and Nifty50 down 4.76%, erasing four weeks of gains. Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%. However, Nifty Pharma performed well with a 1.55% weekly gain.

**Lets analyze the NIFTY pharma it stocks with the help of RRG**

**Leading Quadrant:** JBCHEPHARMA, MANKIND, NATCOPHARM, GRANULES, DRREDDY, LUPIN, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are currently in the Leading Quadrant. However, LUPIN, NATCOPHARM, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are losing momentum and heading toward the Weakening Quadrant.

**Weakening Quadrant:** LAURUSLABS, BIOCON, TORENTPHARMA, and ABBOTINDIA are positioned in the Weakening Quadrant. Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant. In contrast, LAURUSLABS and BIOCON are exhibiting high negative strength and are drifting toward the Lagging Quadrant.

**Lagging Quadrant:** DIVISLAB, CIPLA, AJANTAPHARMA, ALKEM, and GLAND are in the Lagging Quadrant. Notably, all the stocks, except DIVISLAB, are showing signs of recovery and are attempting to move toward the Improving Quadrant.

**Improving Quadrant:** AUROPHARMA, GLENMARK, and IPCA are in the Improving Quadrant. While AUROPHARMA and GLENMARK are progressing with strong positive momentum, IPCA is struggling to transition into the Leading Quadrant.",2024-12-21 11:59:07,23.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hj8g72/market_records_biggest_weekly_fall_in_more_than_2/,IndianStockMarket

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories shares fell 6.2% after reporting a modest 2% YoY growth in Q3 FY25 net profit to ₹1,413 crore. While revenue growth remained strong, competition and future product approvals remain key concerns, according to analysts like Jefferies, Nuvama, and DAM Capital.

On the technical front, the stock has found strong trendline support, which has held since July 2023, potentially limiting further declines.",2025-01-24 07:25:35,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1i8q24k/dr_reddys_labs_shares_drop_6_after_q3_results/,StockMarketIndia
post,1hj8dht,Market records biggest weekly fall in more than 2 years; which sector performed well??,ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/qik604ymx68e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccc9b95fd7ff511d5ad4aecd246551e34ff335a2

The Indian markets saw their biggest weekly drop in over two years, with the Sensex falling 4.98% and Nifty50 down 4.76%, erasing four weeks of gains. Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%. However, Nifty Pharma performed well with a 1.55% weekly gain.

 **Lets analyze the NIFTY pharma it stocks with the help of RRG** 

**Leading Quadrant:** JBCHEPHARMA, MANKIND, NATCOPHARM, GRANULES, DRREDDY, LUPIN, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are currently in the Leading Quadrant. However, LUPIN, NATCOPHARM, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are losing momentum and heading toward the Weakening Quadrant. 

**Weakening Quadrant:** LAURUSLABS, BIOCON, TORENTPHARMA, and ABBOTINDIA are positioned in the Weakening Quadrant. Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant. In contrast, LAURUSLABS and BIOCON are exhibiting high negative strength and are drifting toward the Lagging Quadrant.

 **Lagging Quadrant:** DIVISLAB, CIPLA, AJANTAPHARMA, ALKEM, and GLAND are in the Lagging Quadrant. Notably, all the stocks, except DIVISLAB, are showing signs of recovery and are attempting to move toward the Improving Quadrant. 

**Improving Quadrant:** AUROPHARMA, GLENMARK, and IPCA are in the Improving Quadrant. While AUROPHARMA and GLENMARK are progressing with strong positive momentum, IPCA is struggling to transition into the Leading Quadrant.",2024-12-21 11:53:55,4.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hj8dht/market_records_biggest_weekly_fall_in_more_than_2/,StockMarketIndia

post,1hi1f1h,Sectoral MF vs Individual stocks ,EmployeeSuspicious87,"Hey folks,

As many say,

What’s the issue in holding sectoral ETF/MF and also direct stocks?

Example: I heavily invest in ITBees and also have high amount of shares in TCS, Infy, HCL, Wipro, so what’s the issue? 

I see peoples say if you are buying all IT stocks, rather invest in ITBees itself? I personally don’t get it!

Although I invest in ITBees (for safer reasons), I know all the 4 individual stocks are of high quality - why can’t i invest in them for stock price appreciation + (dividends/bonus/split), remember Wipro just gave 1:1 Bonus, these are just icing on the cake to get such benefits and multiply your wealth in the longer run (ETF/Index funds don’t give them rather it’s a safer bet thingy as mentioned above)

Same goes for Pharmabees + (I invest in DrReddy and Natcopharma)

and 

BankBees + (I invest in HDFC, SouthIndian, IDFC, Planning to start IndusInd as well)

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories shares fell 6.2% after reporting a modest 2% YoY growth in Q3 FY25 net profit to ₹1,413 crore. While revenue growth remained strong, competition and future product approvals remain key concerns, according to analysts like Jefferies, Nuvama, and DAM Capital.

On the technical front, the stock has found strong trendline support, which has held since July 2023, potentially limiting further declines.",2025-01-24 07:30:02,4.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1i8q4bn/dr_reddys_labs_shares_drop_6_after_q3_results/,IndianStreetBets

post,1hj8gq0,Market records biggest weekly fall in more than 2 years; which sector performed well??,ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/dmy8jefny68e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2daa65a32aa70938d08ab7df0f106a5d7ac0d3ea

The Indian markets saw their biggest weekly drop in over two years, with the Sensex falling 4.98% and Nifty50 down 4.76%, erasing four weeks of gains. Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%. However, Nifty Pharma performed well with a 1.55% weekly gain.

**Lets analyze the NIFTY pharma it stocks with the help of RRG**

**Leading Quadrant:** JBCHEPHARMA, MANKIND, NATCOPHARM, GRANULES, DRREDDY, LUPIN, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are currently in the Leading Quadrant. However, LUPIN, NATCOPHARM, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are losing momentum and heading toward the Weakening Quadrant.

**Weakening Quadrant:** LAURUSLABS, BIOCON, TORENTPHARMA, and ABBOTINDIA are positioned in the Weakening Quadrant. Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant. In contrast, LAURUSLABS and BIOCON are exhibiting high negative strength and are drifting toward the Lagging Quadrant.

**Lagging Quadrant:** DIVISLAB, CIPLA, AJANTAPHARMA, ALKEM, and GLAND are in the Lagging Quadrant. Notably, all the stocks, except DIVISLAB, are showing signs of recovery and are attempting to move toward the Improving Quadrant.

**Improving Quadrant:** AUROPHARMA, GLENMARK, and IPCA are in the Improving Quadrant. While AUROPHARMA and GLENMARK are progressing with strong positive momentum, IPCA is struggling to transition into the Leading Quadrant.

post,1gllq87,Why are Indian benchmarks falling despite TRUMP takeover?,kzarraja,"HINDALCO Industries is down 8% and is leading the fall in Nifty50 after its U.S. unit Novelis posted a weak quarterly profit.

48 out of 50 Nifty constituents are falling, making HINDALCO  the biggest loser on the Nifty with huge selling volumes.

Hindalco is approaching it's 200DMA coinciding with the immediate support at 645. Below this, the stock might go into a corrective phase.
