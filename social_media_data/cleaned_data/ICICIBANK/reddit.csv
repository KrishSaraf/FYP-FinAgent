post,1ib8mh8,Holding Nifty PE 22400,choco007late007,"I think Nifty easily drops 500 points from where it is today(22800) by 30th Jan.
This is because Trump in Power, No Major Indication of Favouring Budget, Inflation would worsen the budget this year. Also Earnings not that great plus China impacting all the Global Economies( Automotive, AI- recently launched genai  model, tough competition to US and Europe), Many Sanctions, Cost cutting soon coming because of all this.

Only Companies which are in Monopoly Business would be in better shape in upcoming Year.

Government would focus more on Overall Economy rather than focusing on Corporate/ Companies.

Dont go lobg in such period. Market would Fall for sure and rebound only if we have an awesome budget.

post,1gtiern,Portfolio review please,dreamer0910,"Background: Till about 1 year ago, I would have referred to myself as a super-diversified hardcore value conscious defensive investor. Still would call myself that but have taken positions in some not-large-cap companies in the last 1 year.

I have 75 stocks in my portfolio but have include 42 in the screenshot below with a sizeable position > 75k

Rationale for the top holdings

1. HDFC Bank: Biggest private sector bank with a focus on retail and growing in Tier-2/3 cities. We are 1 stock market crash away from HDFC Bank rallying. Irony?
2. Angel One: Growing the second fastest in brokers. Fairly valued as compared to Groww but overvalued as compare to Zerodha.

3. INFY/HCL/Wipro: Most of my positions are more than 2 years old. Now, you can call it Betting on Trump
4. IRFC: Got lucky. Bought at a decent valuation when the stock was 25. Sold 1/3 position at 125 and still hold the remaining 2/3 of the position. Will let it play out because if India needs to move at scale, railways need to be better and more common. Railways get their funding from IRFC.
5. Amara Raja: Betting on a reputed battery company with the most reliable battery brand (Amron). Bought it at decent valuations around 2 years back
6. Divis/Dr. Reddy/NH/Lal Pathlabs: Consumer companies in an economy where focus on healthcare is expected to grow

I think in the short-term, we are all guessing andnoone can predict price movement, so why bother

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1e7b8gb,Portfolio query Is PMS a viable option?,greatergood07,"Hello everyone, I currently have a self made folio of about 23L (entered market in Mar 21) with a 50% Large,30% mid & 20% small allocation and 80% value from 18 stocks. I am 41 and doent have any liabilities, house is paid for, not interested in owning a car right now (If I will, I'll buy with cash) to add to this I have a year of expenses saved asside as emergency funds plus a PPF account which matures next year.

I am also fortunate to inherit my parents folio which is currently at 1.8c with 82% of it coming from 12 stocks and it has a total of 65 stocks which were bought almost a decade back and has not been managed since. It just compounded over time. Note: Dad retired from L&T thus 33% which I need to trim. This along with my folio is for my retirement and plan to keep it long term 15+ yrs

Now I am considering if I should go with a PMS (some options are Liquide black/Kedia securities. I am also checking for one of my aqquitances who manages PMS and is a ex Axis bank employee used to manage HNIs

Talk about Liquide they charge currently have a flat structure of 30k annually and provides a 360 approach to investing including tax planning. They will have around 10 custom stocks and plan to deploy funds over 2 weeks in the market. I was a bit concerned about it but they said they are taking money from equity and reinvesting into other stocks so not really a risk persay. Also folio will be managed by me 100% they just act as advisory.

Over the years I feel it is better to have specialists working (like a team of yours) that makes life easier. I'll be happy if I can get a 17%-18% CAGR and peaceful sleep

Your thoughts please.. I'm sharing snapshot of my folio (from Zerodha) and parents folio (excel) so you have a fair idea on how I have performed (everyone has performed in the bull market 😁)

Your recommendations are really appreciated, Thank You :)",2024-07-19 18:47:53,4.0,14.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1e7b8gb/portfolio_query_is_pms_a_viable_option/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1e7b8gb,,,,,,,ldz6h85,None,"One simple thing. You can't hold stocks for long on someone's suggestions, you will start to doubt yourself and advisory in a bear market. Understand the market, pick undervalued, growing, quality stocks, invest and forget. Your stock picking skills are good IMO. Just hold for long. No advisory will come in help if COVID or 2008 crash repeats, you are most likely to sell those in panic and due to lack of understanding the business. ☺️ I'm not much qualified to advice, still I have heard these from my father. He was approached by a PMS manager, but luckily he got away from it. Now he holds many 10-20-30-40+ baggers. I'm more focused towards studying and picking growing smallcaps in value zone. Anyways PMS won't help in any market. Check historic returns of popular PMFs. Compare it with an index fund. You will yourself beat them if you have conviction on business and hold.

comment,1e7b8gb,,,,,,,m5typ79,tadmasan,"For a portfolio exceeding ₹1 crore, a PMS (Portfolio Management Service) is often a wise choice. Here’s why:

1. **Professional Expertise**: PMS ensures active monitoring and management by experts with a dedicated research team.
2. **Better Returns**: With the right firm, you can expect consistent returns, often exceeding 15% CAGR over the long term (5+ years).
3. **Peace of Mind**: Delegating your portfolio management reduces stress and lets you focus on other priorities.

**My Recommendations**:  
Avoid smaller players like Liquide. Instead, consider reputed firms like **360One** and **Alchemy Capital**. Both have a proven track record and are trusted by many HNIs, including several of my own clients who are extremely happy with the performance and stability of their PMS investments.

I'm looking to do so by comparing a combination of ratios, but that's still so confusing and time consuming considering each industry has its own benchmark/ historical average.

Is there a free tool/ website that can help in comparison and ease my decision making?

post,1fz1jny,NRI Investing: Diversification and Repatriation Concerns,TrickyCourt9880,"Hi everyone,

I'm a recent US immigrant looking for advice on diversifying my investments and saving money here. I already have a significant stake in Indian stock markets, but I'm concerned about the high taxes on NRIs and the transaction/currency conversion costs involved in sending money to India.

My biggest worry is the tax implications of repatriating funds back to the US in 5-10 years. I've been unable to find a comprehensive guide online, so I'm hoping to learn from your experiences.

>When a mutual fund builds a portfolio of investments, it could throw in some risky bonds and some not so risky ones. And low risk bonds are highly unlikely to default on their debts. So selling CDS for them could actually mean that the mutual fund pockets some extra income in the form of premiums.  
\[[source](https://finshots.in/archive/sebi-rbi-credit-default-swap-cds-mutual-funds/)\]

Now, CDO's in India are nothing new ([first one came out in 2002](https://www.icicibank.com/about-us/article/news-icici-launches-indias-first-cdo-fund-20131812145138312#:~:text=today%20announced%20the%20launch%20of,mutual%20fund%20registered%20with%20SEBI)). But I wonder SEBI allowing MF's to sell CDO backed CDS's encourage the supply of risky bonds in the Indian market.

Since someone has to rate these swaps, a few bad apples combined with faulty regulation/corruption from SEBI's side could cause people to lose trust in these wonderful financial instrument.",2024-06-16 08:42:54,0.0,4.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1dh3als/how_likely_are_indian_mfs_selling_cdo_backed/,IndianStockMarket

Now, I have some doubts regarding my portfolio:

1. **Is my MF portfolio good?**

I started with 5 SIPs based on my research but kept adding more whenever I found something interesting. Recently, friends advised that having too many MF SIPs can be problematic. They mentioned that the investment amount shouldn't change, but the number of MFs should be fewer. I didn't fully understand this. Are they right? If so, why? Also, if I need to reduce the number of MFs, which SIPs should I keep and which should I let go?

2. **Should I invest less in SIPs and more in stocks?**

I'm 29, and my friends say my risk appetite is higher. However, I prefer long-term investments and don't have the time or expertise to buy/sell stocks regularly. Am I making a mistake by focusing more on SIPs? Should I allocate more to stocks?

3. **Should I consider an SWP?**

4. I have 10 lacs to invest now. Any suggestions on how to allocate this based on my current portfolio?

Sorry for the many questions, but I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!",2024-06-27 05:22:34,4.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1dpjl0b/seeking_advice_on_my_investment_portfolio/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1dpjl0b,,,,,,,lahef35,Individual_Zombie_85,"1. Yeah I think you have way too many MF's. You can reduce it to 4-5 funds max. Please check the overlap between the different funds. I don't think multiple ELSS Tax Saver funds are required. Just keep 1 from each category. The reason for not keeping multiple MF's is, different expense ratios can keep eating into your profits.
2. If you don't have time to analyse and buy/sell stocks, you can continue with your SIP, no problem in that. You mentioned that you are picking stocks based on your friend's suggestions, and that can go horribly wrong. It's your life and your financial goals, so you can take the call about which way you want to go.

post,1jw14ke,Possible Scam Involving ICICI Bank – Need Advice & Help with Escalation,lizrojer,"On 2nd March, I got a call from an unknown number. The guy claimed he accidentally deposited ₹20,000 into my ICICI bank account via a cash deposit machine (CDM) and wanted it back. I’ve heard about those “money in your account” scams before, so I laughed it off and disconnected.

Out of curiosity, I checked my bank statement later that day. This account is mainly for rent and small income inflows, so it’s busy. Sure enough, there was an inflow that day. I wasn’t sure if it was from this guy or from one of my regular sources.

Since everyone has their own struggles, I called him back and told him that if it was genuinely his money, I’d return it. But then came the red flags.

**Red Flags:**

1. **Timing doesn’t add up:**  
   He said he deposited the money on *22nd February*, but he only realized it on *2nd March*. That’s over a week of no follow-up for a ₹20K cash deposit. His excuse? He just “didn’t know.” If anyone deposits that kind of money and it doesn’t show up, wouldn’t they panic instantly?

2. **CDM safeguards ignored:**  
   He claimed to have used a CDM without a debit card. But CDMs ask you to enter the account number *twice*, show the account holder’s name, and ask you to confirm it before proceeding. These are built-in checks to prevent exactly this kind of “accident.” He apparently just blew past all of them.

3. **No receipt:**  
   CDMs issue a receipt with the recipient’s name, partial account number, and the amount. He has no receipt. None. That’s suspicious.

4. **Breach of privacy?**  
   He says that after he “complained” to ICICI, a bank employee handed over **my phone number, account number, and branch details** to him. ICICI is one of the biggest private banks in India. Is it normal for their staff to give out customer details like this?

5. **Bank official calls me:**  
   On *7th March*, a bank staff member called me and asked *when I’ll be depositing the ₹20K* into that guy’s account. I pushed back and said I can’t do that—it doesn’t sound like a standard process. She then said she’ll forward the complaint to my home branch. Since when does a bank ask you to hand over money via CDM without verifying if the claim is even legitimate?

6. **Weird email trail:**  
   I visited my home branch recently, and they showed me a few emails regarding this. All of them say something like:  
   ""*X amount was deposited on X date. Y person says it was done by mistake. Kindly verify and, if it was indeed an error, please return it.*""  
   So basically, *they put the onus entirely on me to verify the claim*, while verbally sounding 100% sure that it’s a mistake. That contradiction feels off.

On advice from some helpful folks on LegalAdviceIndia, I’ve already moved my funds (excluding the disputed ₹20K) to another bank account just to be safe.

I genuinely feel like this is some kind of scam. Too many things don’t add up. I might be wrong—but this whole thing smells fishy.

**What should I reply to ICICI?**  
Also, if anyone knows a direct **grievance redressal email** (not the generic customercare@icicibank.com), please share it. I want to escalate this.

Thanks in advance!

One day, I received a call from an AC technician whom I paid earlier through UPI, saying he has accidentally transferred 20K to my account. At first, I thought it was a scam and just disconnected the call without listening much. But a little later, I actually received an SMS confirming the deposit. I double-checked through net banking, SMS, transaction history, and even bank’s customer care to make sure the money had really come in. Once I was fully sure, I spoke to him. He kept requesting that I transfer the money back directly to his account as it was EID in a few days, and he needed the money for the festival, but I found it suspicious and refused.

I told him clearly that since it was his mistake, he should go to his bank and raise a complaint to reverse the transaction properly. Despite that, he kept calling and insisting I transfer the money manually. I wasn’t convinced. Instead, I raised a complaint with my bank (HDFC) and explained everything — that I had received someone else's money by mistake, I didn’t intend to keep it, and I gave permission for the bank to reverse it. But I would not manually send money to anyone’s account.

There was a lot of back and forth between me, the bank, and the technician. Eventually, the bank was able to reverse the amount on their own. I never transferred anything manually from my side.",2025-04-10 17:05:14,70.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/1jw14ke/possible_scam_involving_icici_bank_need_advice/,IndiaInvestments
comment,1jw14ke,,,,,,,mmequv4,Murky_Red,"I faced a similar issue with SBI, and this was the process. The depositor has to provide a notarized affidavit to his branch stating that this was an accidental deposit, and that if the transaction is proven to be genuine he will return the amount. That branch of his bank will send it to yours, which  will keep a copy and give you the original. Only then your account can be debited, with your permission and signature on the vouchers.",2025-04-10 16:09:01,50.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/1jw14ke/possible_scam_involving_icici_bank_need_advice/,IndiaInvestments

comment,1jw14ke,,,,,,,mmevmob,TieSubstantial9519,"The Bank will not take any responsibility here, since someone deposited cash. Now it comes to you - if this 20k was genuinely for your transaction, the debate ends here - nothing to do, keep your money.

If it was not yours, then also you can enjoy the money if you want (would be immoral obviously), but no harm will come on you. If someone has approached you that they by mistake deposited money in your account and it's not your money then most likely they are correct. You can transfer the money to that guy - take a signed undertaking from that guy that he accidentally transferred some money to you and you are simply transferring it back along with a copy of his I'd proof and bank passbook copy (This is to protect you in case in future the guy turns to be a drug peddler and police asks you why did you transferred money to him). 

Bank will not debit any money from your account to anyone's account without your specific authorisation - as in that case you can raise a complaint that the bank transferred money from your account without your permission then the bank is in soup. Even they should not have shared your personal details, that is something not allowed - they could have chosen to mediate in good faith and with your permission only shared your details with the person.",2025-04-10 16:32:26,12.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/1jw14ke/possible_scam_involving_icici_bank_need_advice/,IndiaInvestments

post,1in0vov,"Growth in my trading journey, happy to go slow and steady :)",Adventurous-Gap8307,"Finally made my first 5 digit profit, been trading small quantities for over 1.5 years alongside my freelancing job

Not a new trader, been trading for over 2 years now but was trading with 50k-1L capital and used to withdraw my profits from time to time. Always traded options for swings(max total value never more than 8-10k) and max 2 good swing setups a week. Everything else intraday, risk no more than 700-800 rs per trade and target 1:2/1:3. Intraday I mostly trade as per the trending sectors, and then selecting the stocks which have moved less compared to the other stocks and enter those.

Capital used for today’s trades is approx 1.2L, was planning not to deploy more than 1L but market was trending so deployed slightly more.

Have been reading a lot of posts here everyday which describe how it’s almost impossible to make money trading. Just want to let everybody know, that it’s not impossible, but the learning curve is VERY steep. And by the time most people reach the end of this curve, they’ve blown up multiple accounts, and also end up destroying the other MOST important thing, which is their mindset.

So please remember, always start small. Take more swings and wait patiently for your setups to form. Risk very little in intraday as market doesn’t trend everyday, atleast not all the sectors. Some will trend daily but you need to get the flow right, which again takes a lot of time. Risking and making less intraday is crucial, which lets you ride your swings fully. 5-6 days like today and I can make a 6 figure income, which I’d say at my level is extremely good

And also, having a source of income alongside trading gives you a peace of mind. Not forcing you to take the substandard setups/trades. 

If you be disciplined, less greedy and fully focused on what you do, the money eventually comes. Stop focusing on daily/weekly results and be fully in sync with the process. There is indeed light at the end of this tunnel, provided you don’t stray from the correct path :) ",2025-02-11 15:16:25,3.0,9.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1in0vov/growth_in_my_trading_journey_happy_to_go_slow_and/,StockMarketIndia

UltraTech Cement is consolidating near its all-time high, with Bollinger Bands contracting—indicating a potential big move ahead. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is signaling a buy, and the stock is trading above the 20 EMA and 40 EMA, reflecting bullish momentum. Fresh OI additions at the 12,500 Call strike indicate bullish sentiment. This sets up a 500-point trading range, offering opportunities for breakout and momentum trades. Fresh OI additions at the 12500 call suggests that the call writers are shifting their position to 12500. This development potentially opens up 500 points upside based on the Open Interest data",2024-12-13 11:10:17,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hd9ytz/ultratech_cement_bullish_momentum_builds_near/,StockMarketIndia

post,1fre4dr,Where do we go now?,aman2992,"Portfolio update: Invested barely 60k over last 5 months vs an average investment run rate of 40k per month over last ~7 years. Portfolio value grew by almost 10L nonetheless. Basis experience so far in the markets, can't find value anywhere currently. Holding 2.5L in cash for any correction.

Right move at this point seems to diversify away from equities. However, overall debt portfolio also is sizeable and it doesn't seem wise to add to it considering taxes and inflation. Hence have zeroed down on land or real estate as the next investment vehicle. However, ticket size is huge, which is why I feel I am caught in a long waiting game.

Medium term strategy for equities is to keep building the cash position waiting for prices to cool down (US elections, interest rate move maybe) and to build a safety shell around equity portfolio so that it needn't be touched and can keep growing at whatever rate.

post,1im0vye,Strengthening the Indian Rupee: Leveraging Idle Gold through Enhanced Banking Schemes,supereminent_,"India's cultural affinity for gold has led to an estimated 25,000 tonnes of the precious metal being held by households and temples, often lying idle in lockers and vaults.

[tianjindaxuexuebao.com](https://tianjindaxuexuebao.com/dashboard/uploads/8.%204V2ZJ.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)This vast reserve, if effectively mobilized, presents a significant opportunity to bolster our economy and strengthen the Indian Rupee (INR).



**The Economic Impact of Idle Gold:**

* **Current Account Deficit (CAD):** India is one of the world's largest importers of gold. This high volume of imports contributes substantially to the CAD, exerting pressure on the INR.[tianjindaxuexuebao.com](https://tianjindaxuexuebao.com/dashboard/uploads/8.%204V2ZJ.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Currency Depreciation:** A higher CAD often leads to the depreciation of the INR against major currencies, affecting the country's purchasing power and economic stability.[policybazaar.com](https://www.policybazaar.com/gold-rate/articles/how-gold-affects-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Proposed Solution: Gold Monetization and Specialized Loan Schemes**

To mitigate these challenges, we should encourage the infusion of idle gold into the economy. The government and financial institutions can play a pivotal role by:

1. **Enhancing Gold Monetization Schemes (GMS):** The GMS, introduced in 2015, aims to mobilize idle gold by allowing individuals and institutions to deposit gold with banks in exchange for interest earnings. However, its uptake has been limited due to various factors, including lack of awareness and concerns about the safety and returns.[tianjindaxuexuebao.com](https://tianjindaxuexuebao.com/dashboard/uploads/8.%204V2ZJ.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
2. **Introducing Specialized Gold-Backed Loan Products:** Banks can develop loan products that offer favorable terms to individuals and businesses willing to pledge their gold holdings. This approach can:
   * **Provide Liquidity:** Enable gold holders to access funds without selling their assets.
   * **Reduce Gold Imports:** Satisfy domestic demand through recycled gold, thereby decreasing the need for imports.
   * **Strengthen the INR:** Lower gold imports can help reduce the CAD, contributing to a stronger INR.

**Current Banking Initiatives:**

Several banks have initiated gold loan schemes to provide liquidity against gold assets. For instance:

* **ICICI Bank:** Offers gold loans with interest rates starting from 9.25%, allowing loans up to ₹2 crore with flexible repayment options.[icicibank.com](https://www.icicibank.com/personal-banking/loans/gold-loan?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **State Bank of India (SBI):** Provides personal gold loans with interest rates starting from 8.50% per annum, catering to various financial needs.[sbi.co.in](https://www.sbi.co.in/web/personal-banking/loans/gold-loan?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **HDFC Bank:** Offers quick disbursal of gold loans with competitive interest rates and flexible tenure options.[hdfcbank.com](https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/borrow/loan-against-assets/gold-loan?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Conclusion:**

By effectively mobilizing idle gold through enhanced monetization schemes and specialized loan products, we can reduce our dependence on gold imports, lower the CAD, and work towards strengthening the INR. It's imperative for policymakers, financial institutions, and citizens to collaborate in this endeavor to harness the economic potential of our gold reserves.

post,1imylri,Straightforward day at Sensex,RoundLevel7298,"If you trade index options, you'd know that sensex was a fairly simple decay until 1:30, until it wasn't!

With the straddle at 500+ on open and 150 w 2 hours to expiry (with a straight decay) you'd know that the story isn't over there, is it? 

Why would the straddle be 500+ points if it had to give a straight decay? If markets are pricing volatility, then in 90% of the cases there will be volatility. 

I know people who went short straight up and then kept waiting for the 30 points to decay, it doesn't work that way. Take your money when it's available and take it home. 

In the picture: today's trade that took the trailing SL as 30 strangle went to ₹500 :)

UltraTech Cement is consolidating near its all-time high, with Bollinger Bands contracting—indicating a potential big move ahead. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is signaling a buy, and the stock is trading above the 20 EMA and 40 EMA, reflecting bullish momentum. Fresh OI additions at the 12,500 Call strike indicate bullish sentiment. This sets up a 500-point trading range, offering opportunities for breakout and momentum trades. Fresh OI additions at the 12500 call suggests that the call writers are shifting their position to 12500.

comment,1eug3g1,,,,,,,lik31a8,Puzzleheaded_Run21,"Did total number of shares outstanding remain the same? Did shareholders increase just because some big investor sold his or her shares and retailers purchased it? 

I guess the only benefit of having more shareholders is  the increased liquidity coz of the larger base thus driving prices. ",2024-08-17 12:49:47,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1eug3g1/heres_how_total_number_of_shareholders_changed/,IndianStreetBets
