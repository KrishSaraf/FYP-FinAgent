post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1dlx8pc,Portfolio Review and Investment Advice for the Future for a Newbie Investor,esem29,"(Warning: Long Post)

I'm 22 M, graduated college recently, and I've recently started to learn about the Stock Market and Mutual Funds. I learned Fundamental Analysis using Zerodha Varsity, and I'm also constantly reading up on investment basics, strategies, considerations, etc.

My parents are financially very strong, and gave me 12L to put in mutual funds (I will eventually pay the 12L back). After discussing with a friend of theirs who works at Nuvama Investments, I have invested this amount in a mixture of large, mid, and Flexicap funds and some debt funds. I'm expecting good returns from them in the next 3-5 years.

Now, I had around 2.4 L left from a mixture of my internship savings and the money left in my account for my college expenses). My parents encouraged me to start investing in stocks, given I had already done a bit of research. 

I used Screener to filter out some stocks for the long term using some metrics, then did some research on the company to find out the current market and investor sentiment before finally investing in it. I have also identified the major sectors that are going to grow in the next 5 years: Infra, PSU Banks, Defence, Railways, and Oil and Gas. Based on all this,  this is my portfolio right now:

https://preview.redd.it/6ma5z40ix48d1.png?width=1267&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f9ef46d6151deee483f35aa62529ad8153323ae

HAL, BEL, and other Defense stocks seemed to be on a bullish run, and the sentiment about Defense stocks was that they were going to increase a lot. But HAL and BEL dropped a lot these past two days, and what doesn't help is that I've been seeing a lot of news recently about the markets being at an all-time high and some impending corrections coming soon. I was planning to invest in other Defense stocks as well (MAZDOCK, Cochin shipyard, and Paras Defense) but I'm not sure whether right now is a good time to enter these. 

I would love to hear some advice about my portfolio in general. I plan to hold most of them for the long term (3-5 years). I think I have bought too much SBI, I plan to sell half of it at a profit and invest in some other stocks. Some stocks on my watchlist are Railway (IRFC, IRCON, and RVNL), Sun Pharma (Very Strong Financials for the Long Term), and Tata Motors (I've seen People Recommend this stock a lot).

I would love to hear your thoughts on these. Also, I'll start earning soon (around \~1.4L per month post taxes) and I plan to also invest a bit in small-cap MFs, some Debt Instruments, and FDs. I live at home and have negligible monthly expenses, so I'm planning to invest most of my monthly income.

post,1fjn5yt,Results of  Nifty 100 Earnings-Based Strategy,Fit_Soft_3669,"Over the past few months, I have been working on multiple strategies. While backtesting, most strategies have shown returns of around 18% to 20%. However, I've recently been focused on a strategy based on the earnings dates of Nifty 100 companies, using a risk-reward ratio of 1:2.

The results so far look very promising and suggest that the strategy can be further optimized to increase returns. The numbers seem almost too good to be true. Below are some of the results.

Now, I have some doubts regarding my portfolio:

1. **Is my MF portfolio good?**

I started with 5 SIPs based on my research but kept adding more whenever I found something interesting. Recently, friends advised that having too many MF SIPs can be problematic. They mentioned that the investment amount shouldn't change, but the number of MFs should be fewer. I didn't fully understand this. Are they right? If so, why? Also, if I need to reduce the number of MFs, which SIPs should I keep and which should I let go?

2. **Should I invest less in SIPs and more in stocks?**

I'm 29, and my friends say my risk appetite is higher. However, I prefer long-term investments and don't have the time or expertise to buy/sell stocks regularly. Am I making a mistake by focusing more on SIPs? Should I allocate more to stocks?

3. **Should I consider an SWP?**

4. I have 10 lacs to invest now. Any suggestions on how to allocate this based on my current portfolio?

Sorry for the many questions, but I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!",2024-06-27 05:22:34,4.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1dpjl0b/seeking_advice_on_my_investment_portfolio/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1dpjl0b,,,,,,,lahef35,Individual_Zombie_85,"1. Yeah I think you have way too many MF's. You can reduce it to 4-5 funds max. Please check the overlap between the different funds. I don't think multiple ELSS Tax Saver funds are required. Just keep 1 from each category. The reason for not keeping multiple MF's is, different expense ratios can keep eating into your profits.
2. If you don't have time to analyse and buy/sell stocks, you can continue with your SIP, no problem in that. You mentioned that you are picking stocks based on your friend's suggestions, and that can go horribly wrong. It's your life and your financial goals, so you can take the call about which way you want to go. Nothing wrong with either.",2024-06-27 05:54:28,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1dpjl0b/seeking_advice_on_my_investment_portfolio/,IndianStockMarket

Time spent in the market > Timimng the market

So, if you are okay with cash flow go with these stocks as long term and let compounding do its job. 

Now, if you still want to start short term. Then you must have a clear time horizon, knowledge about Technicals, little fundamental, and ready to take a loss.

I would suggest to start with swing trading, you can watch YouTube videos on that. It is hard to name stocks just like that without knowing your risk tolerance.

comment,1dywq7a,,,,,,,lcbjbu7,AutoModerator,"It's awesome that you made a profitable trade. Include reasons why you chose this trade so that new traders can learn. **If the reason for the trade is not mentioned your post will be removed**. Your reason can be as simple as: 'Went long on XYZ FUT because it was near support and had good volumes'. Not sure which flair to use?
