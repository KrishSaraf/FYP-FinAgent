post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1hj8g72,Market records biggest weekly fall in more than 2 years; which sector performed well??,ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/n41tildiy68e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71eaafcf2e4ad19b7bd0956a16afe6f9dba45e4d

The Indian markets saw their biggest weekly drop in over two years, with the Sensex falling 4.98% and Nifty50 down 4.76%, erasing four weeks of gains. Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%. However, Nifty Pharma performed well with a 1.55% weekly gain.

**Lets analyze the NIFTY pharma it stocks with the help of RRG**

**Leading Quadrant:** JBCHEPHARMA, MANKIND, NATCOPHARM, GRANULES, DRREDDY, LUPIN, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are currently in the Leading Quadrant. However, LUPIN, NATCOPHARM, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are losing momentum and heading toward the Weakening Quadrant.

**Weakening Quadrant:** LAURUSLABS, BIOCON, TORENTPHARMA, and ABBOTINDIA are positioned in the Weakening Quadrant. Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant. In contrast, LAURUSLABS and BIOCON are exhibiting high negative strength and are drifting toward the Lagging Quadrant.

**Lagging Quadrant:** DIVISLAB, CIPLA, AJANTAPHARMA, ALKEM, and GLAND are in the Lagging Quadrant. Notably, all the stocks, except DIVISLAB, are showing signs of recovery and are attempting to move toward the Improving Quadrant.

**Improving Quadrant:** AUROPHARMA, GLENMARK, and IPCA are in the Improving Quadrant. While AUROPHARMA and GLENMARK are progressing with strong positive momentum, IPCA is struggling to transition into the Leading Quadrant.",2024-12-21 11:59:07,22.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hj8g72/market_records_biggest_weekly_fall_in_more_than_2/,IndianStockMarket

post,1evtizr,Need guidance on consolidating my holdings,Act-Organic,"Happy Monday,

I've started my investment journey this July and would appreciate any guidance on reducing the number of stocks I hold. Kinda looks like a MF thing right now. I've researched most of the stocks on the list.

In the process of diversifying my portfolio, I've over-diversified and wish to consolidate them to see better gains. I'm in the market for investment since returns here are better than FDs or other safe instruments.

I hope to maximize my returns beating the benchmark in the longer run and have tried to mix large cap, mid cap, and small cap. I wanted to simply put in around 15L and forget about them for the next few years but I've come across terms like re-balancing and wonder if I should re-strategize my approach.

Investment horizon -> 5-7 years.  
FOMO stocks - Mazagon, Suzlon.

I'd really appreciate if some of you could point me in the right direction in the above objective and if there are other (sector) stocks I could add.

Thank you and happy investing.

post,1hj8dht,Market records biggest weekly fall in more than 2 years; which sector performed well??,ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/qik604ymx68e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccc9b95fd7ff511d5ad4aecd246551e34ff335a2

The Indian markets saw their biggest weekly drop in over two years, with the Sensex falling 4.98% and Nifty50 down 4.76%, erasing four weeks of gains. Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%. However, Nifty Pharma performed well with a 1.55% weekly gain.

 **Lets analyze the NIFTY pharma it stocks with the help of RRG** 

**Leading Quadrant:** JBCHEPHARMA, MANKIND, NATCOPHARM, GRANULES, DRREDDY, LUPIN, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are currently in the Leading Quadrant. However, LUPIN, NATCOPHARM, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are losing momentum and heading toward the Weakening Quadrant. 

**Weakening Quadrant:** LAURUSLABS, BIOCON, TORENTPHARMA, and ABBOTINDIA are positioned in the Weakening Quadrant. Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant. In contrast, LAURUSLABS and BIOCON are exhibiting high negative strength and are drifting toward the Lagging Quadrant.

 **Lagging Quadrant:** DIVISLAB, CIPLA, AJANTAPHARMA, ALKEM, and GLAND are in the Lagging Quadrant. Notably, all the stocks, except DIVISLAB, are showing signs of recovery and are attempting to move toward the Improving Quadrant. 

**Improving Quadrant:** AUROPHARMA, GLENMARK, and IPCA are in the Improving Quadrant. While AUROPHARMA and GLENMARK are progressing with strong positive momentum, IPCA is struggling to transition into the Leading Quadrant.",2024-12-21 11:53:55,4.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hj8dht/market_records_biggest_weekly_fall_in_more_than_2/,StockMarketIndia

post,1f7sdp4,Nifty momentum top 10 - Week 1,SehgalK,"Hello all - I’m a professional buysider which means I invest thousands of crores of institutional money for a living. I’ve been doing this for a decade. Separately, of course, I have a personal equity portfolio as well — in that, I have been investing ~40% of my capital based on momentum factor for the past couple of years and that has beat the broader market indices by a decent margin. 

Beginning today, in this thread, I’ll post top 10 stocks from Nifty50 which are currently experiencing high momentum. I’ll update this list on a weekly basis. 

If I see interest in these lists, I’ll post high momentum stocks from small- and mid-caps as well. I have a couple of smallcases as well (freely available) that are also based on momentum tracking. These have given 79% and 20% returns in the past 14 months and 4 months, respectively.

post,1guqq8n,"6 month update: Nifty +5.5%, SmallCap +5%, Midcap +4.5%… NoiceAndToitt +11%",NoiceAndToitt,"Posted 6 months ago about my portfolio reshuffle. I’ve done quite a few trades since then and booked a lot of profit (something like INR 50L YTD)


It’s been another 2 good quarters of returns, outperforming all benchmark indices. 


My biggest learning? It’s rare to outperform a bull market, because everyone is winning. Major outperformance happens in a bear market. If you’ve invested in fundamentally good stocks, they’re not going to fall as fast as the market. And they’ll rise when the market returns - that’s where you get that extra 5-10% a year.


If things go as expected, this should be another year with 30%+ returns (currently at 25% YTD).


What’s next: I want to buy into a couple of core export-oriented stocks. The rupee depreciation will show very positively in their quarterly results. Anyone got a recommendation? (mandatory DYOR for everyone)


Happy to take questions and help out in whatever way possible, good people.

post,1i3dxoy,Analysis 2025 - More research required,SierraBravoLima,"Enter comment in below format, so everybody can easily identify the company.  
""company-name - your comments""

I have started analyzing bunch of companies from Dec 2024 and categorized them. The list of stocks below are categorized as ""More research required"" meaning i lack in understanding their business/financials, so more research is required on these companies. 

This time, i have kept my analysis very simple, as everyone is concerned on Warren's Reserves(CASH) which is above $200b at the moment. So i have looked at these companies Sales, Profits and Reserves. For analysis, i have used [screener.in](http://screener.in/) as [moneycontrol.com](http://moneycontrol.com/) had too many ads.

post,1hj8gq0,Market records biggest weekly fall in more than 2 years; which sector performed well??,ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/dmy8jefny68e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2daa65a32aa70938d08ab7df0f106a5d7ac0d3ea

The Indian markets saw their biggest weekly drop in over two years, with the Sensex falling 4.98% and Nifty50 down 4.76%, erasing four weeks of gains. Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%. However, Nifty Pharma performed well with a 1.55% weekly gain.

**Lets analyze the NIFTY pharma it stocks with the help of RRG**

**Leading Quadrant:** JBCHEPHARMA, MANKIND, NATCOPHARM, GRANULES, DRREDDY, LUPIN, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are currently in the Leading Quadrant. However, LUPIN, NATCOPHARM, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are losing momentum and heading toward the Weakening Quadrant.

**Weakening Quadrant:** LAURUSLABS, BIOCON, TORENTPHARMA, and ABBOTINDIA are positioned in the Weakening Quadrant. Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant. In contrast, LAURUSLABS and BIOCON are exhibiting high negative strength and are drifting toward the Lagging Quadrant.

**Lagging Quadrant:** DIVISLAB, CIPLA, AJANTAPHARMA, ALKEM, and GLAND are in the Lagging Quadrant. Notably, all the stocks, except DIVISLAB, are showing signs of recovery and are attempting to move toward the Improving Quadrant.

**Improving Quadrant:** AUROPHARMA, GLENMARK, and IPCA are in the Improving Quadrant. While AUROPHARMA and GLENMARK are progressing with strong positive momentum, IPCA is struggling to transition into the Leading Quadrant.

post,1gllq87,Why are Indian benchmarks falling despite TRUMP takeover?,kzarraja,"HINDALCO Industries is down 8% and is leading the fall in Nifty50 after its U.S. unit Novelis posted a weak quarterly profit.

48 out of 50 Nifty constituents are falling, making HINDALCO  the biggest loser on the Nifty with huge selling volumes.

Hindalco is approaching it's 200DMA coinciding with the immediate support at 645. Below this, the stock might go into a corrective phase.
