post,1djeool,Swing Trading with just Nifty 50 stocks following a simple stratergy of 30RSI ,kammy_1996,"For the past 3 years, I have been following a simple strategy where I buy stocks whenever they touch 30 RSI (relative strength index) on the daily chart and go all in if they touch 30 RSI on the weekly chart. I also check if the stock is below 200 SMA. So far, I have a winning ratio of 90%. I mostly invest in nifty 50 stocks and good fundamental companies like hdfc, Unilever, and Bajfin. The capital I usually play with is 10–20L. I usually sell the stocks, taking 15–30%, and sometimes I hold them for a long-term portfolio. I don't follow news and company results for the stocks I am holding. I also have MFs in my long-term portfolio. 

My goal is to make 20% per year and eventually create a stock portfolio of 50L, making 10L a year just from the markets. 

How good is this strategy? considering the market has been in a bull run for the past several years now.

comment,1djeool,,,,,,,l9adc7m,ResidentAd8536,"This is a good strategy since you are investing in stronger companies. It works almost all the time, specially on weekly charts.

But remember, in bear markets, this will keep your money stuck for quite some time. But eventually they will rise, the question will be how many days do you want to keep your money invested in one stock. But anyways that will give you returns in long run.

comment,1djeool,,,,,,,l9ajxck,demonslayer101,I use a similar strategy but with riskier stocks. I find stocks that have bottomed out (or about to) and filter them by their fundamentals. Now and then I buy a little whenever they fall by 5-10%. These stocks eventually tend to form Rounding bottom and later you see people talking about them on twitter as they form Cup and Handle pattern ahead of a breakout. It's less stressful to think long term and buy at the bottom.

34YO Male. Professional Income. 

Started post-Covid. But a substantial sum out of this has been invested in the last 3-4 months.

Point is to review the portfolio / allocation etc. as it stands today - for the future. That is why I have provided current value of holdings (though invested sum can be calculated pretty easily). Past gains (especially %ages) are indicative of pretty much nothing as I have been irregular in buying and accumulating over the said period.

Would love everyone's views and opinions. 

PS - discerning folks on here will be able to see Saurabh Mukherjea's influence but even more discerning (and sympathethic) folks will be able to see I am reducing the said influence now 😄

LATE (AND LONG) EDIT - As rightly said in some replies, MF portfolio has some unnecessary over-complication. I'm slowly moving my inv from Axis ELSS to PP ELSS (as and when 3 year limit ends), so count one less fund. The two PP funds again I count as basically one big Flexi fund, so that's again one less fund. Small caps I don't feel comfortable with just one fund, and the universe is large enough to accommodate two funds. 
So basically-
•one Largecap (Niftybees) 
•one Flexicap (2 PPs + whatever's left of Axis)
•one Large & Mid
•one Midcap
•two Smallcaps
•one USA (where in fact if someone can suggest which should I actually invest in, anyway PP Flexi can't invest more in the US stocks).

post,1jln8qe,TradingView mobile erroneous percentage change numbers,ClayAndBackpack,"Ive been using TradingView from before, and nowadays see that the percentage drop in index doesn’t look accurate for some of the indices and profiles. 
Nifty for example: 1% of 23557=233.57, which means 0.7% of 23557=164.90. 
And 34.1 points drop=-0.14% and not 0.7% as shown in the snippet. 
For Bajfinance, 1.00% of 8896=88.96, not 107 points. And 107 points=1.20%, not 1.00%. 
What’s happening to this basic math? What am I missing?

I’ve been observing this for some days, and given being a spreadsheet calculation nerd, i started questioning my quick math abilities due to this inconsistency.

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1g162b1,I asked chatgpt for multi bagger stocks ,Ok_Consideration5028,"Here are **five Indian stocks** that have the potential to become multibaggers, based on current trends, their market positions, and future growth potential. Keep in mind that multibagger stocks carry risks and require patience for long-term returns.

### 1. **Tata Power (NSE: TATAPOWER)**
   - **Why:** Tata Power is one of India's largest integrated power companies, with a growing focus on renewable energy, EV charging infrastructure, and solar energy solutions. As India pushes for green energy, Tata Power is well-positioned to benefit from this transition.

### 2. **Persistent Systems (NSE: PERSISTENT)**
   - **Why:** Persistent Systems is a mid-sized IT services company specializing in digital transformation, cloud services, and product engineering. With increasing digitalization globally and its focus on next-gen tech like AI, cloud computing, and IoT, it has strong growth prospects.

### 3. **Bajaj Finance (NSE: BAJFINANCE)**
   - **Why:** Bajaj Finance is a leading player in the consumer finance sector. It has a diversified product portfolio, including retail lending, SME lending, and wealth management. With India's growing demand for credit and financial services, this stock has significant long-term growth potential.

### 4. **Deepak Nitrite (NSE: DEEPAKNTR)**
   - **Why:** Deepak Nitrite is a leading chemical manufacturer with a strong market presence in performance chemicals, phenolics, and fine chemicals. The chemical industry in India is expected to grow exponentially, and Deepak Nitrite's diversification and robust operational efficiency make it a potential multibagger.

### 5. **Polycab India (NSE: POLYCAB)**
   - **Why:** Polycab is a market leader in the cables and wires industry, with a growing footprint in the consumer electricals space. With the government’s focus on infrastructure development, electrification, and housing, Polycab stands to benefit from increased demand for electrical goods.

### Key Points to Watch:
- **Sectoral Trends:** These companies are in sectors that are poised for long-term growth, such as renewable energy, digital services, consumer finance, and chemicals.
- **Economic and Policy Factors:** Favorable government policies, infrastructure spending, and renewable energy goals could provide a tailwind for these stocks.
- **Valuation and Entry Points:** It's important to assess their valuation before investing. Some stocks might be overvalued due to market enthusiasm, so timing your entry is crucial.

These suggestions are for informational purposes, and it's always advisable to do thorough research or consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.",2024-10-11 09:48:18,0.0,16.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g162b1/i_asked_chatgpt_for_multi_bagger_stocks/,IndianStockMarket

Bajaj Finance may see action in the coming sessions as it is resting on its support area. The momentum indicator is bullish with positive divergence on the daily chart, and the 1-year Price/Book Value (P/BV) is below its -1 SD, indicating potential undervaluation. A similar setup in August 2024 led to a 20% rally, and there's a chance the pattern could repeat.

Bajaj Finance experienced a strong bull run from June 2020 to August 2021, followed by sideways movement with consistent support along a trendline. Recently, it formed an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the trendline and broke out, gaining 6.5%. The stock is trading above the 20 SMA and 40 EMA on daily and weekly timeframes, with the RMI (Rohit Momentum Indicator) signaling a buy on both. For now, the stock is looking positive.

Open Interest (OI) is near record highs, indicating significant short built-up. Despite this, the stock has consistently formed higher lows, suggesting a triangle pattern with boundaries at ₹8000 and ₹6,520. Historically, such setups have led to sharp rallies if the stock breaks out on the upside. Conversely, a breakdown could lead to fresh OI highs and downward pressure.",2025-01-04 10:35:48,10.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1htbskq/bajaj_finances_next_move_can_the_bulls_charge/,IndianStockMarket

post,1e7b8gb,Portfolio query Is PMS a viable option?,greatergood07,"Hello everyone, I currently have a self made folio of about 23L (entered market in Mar 21) with a 50% Large,30% mid & 20% small allocation and 80% value from 18 stocks. I am 41 and doent have any liabilities, house is paid for, not interested in owning a car right now (If I will, I'll buy with cash) to add to this I have a year of expenses saved asside as emergency funds plus a PPF account which matures next year.

I am also fortunate to inherit my parents folio which is currently at 1.8c with 82% of it coming from 12 stocks and it has a total of 65 stocks which were bought almost a decade back and has not been managed since. It just compounded over time. Note: Dad retired from L&T thus 33% which I need to trim. This along with my folio is for my retirement and plan to keep it long term 15+ yrs

Now I am considering if I should go with a PMS (some options are Liquide black/Kedia securities. I am also checking for one of my aqquitances who manages PMS and is a ex Axis bank employee used to manage HNIs

Talk about Liquide they charge currently have a flat structure of 30k annually and provides a 360 approach to investing including tax planning. They will have around 10 custom stocks and plan to deploy funds over 2 weeks in the market. I was a bit concerned about it but they said they are taking money from equity and reinvesting into other stocks so not really a risk persay. Also folio will be managed by me 100% they just act as advisory.

Over the years I feel it is better to have specialists working (like a team of yours) that makes life easier. I'll be happy if I can get a 17%-18% CAGR and peaceful sleep

Your thoughts please.. I'm sharing snapshot of my folio (from Zerodha) and parents folio (excel) so you have a fair idea on how I have performed (everyone has performed in the bull market 😁)

Your recommendations are really appreciated, Thank You :)",2024-07-19 18:47:53,3.0,14.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1e7b8gb/portfolio_query_is_pms_a_viable_option/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1e7b8gb,,,,,,,ldz6h85,None,"One simple thing. You can't hold stocks for long on someone's suggestions, you will start to doubt yourself and advisory in a bear market. Understand the market, pick undervalued, growing, quality stocks, invest and forget. Your stock picking skills are good IMO. Just hold for long. No advisory will come in help if COVID or 2008 crash repeats, you are most likely to sell those in panic and due to lack of understanding the business. ☺️ I'm not much qualified to advice, still I have heard these from my father. He was approached by a PMS manager, but luckily he got away from it. Now he holds many 10-20-30-40+ baggers. I'm more focused towards studying and picking growing smallcaps in value zone. Anyways PMS won't help in any market. Check historic returns of popular PMFs. Compare it with an index fund. You will yourself beat them if you have conviction on business and hold.

comment,1e7b8gb,,,,,,,m5typ79,tadmasan,"For a portfolio exceeding ₹1 crore, a PMS (Portfolio Management Service) is often a wise choice. Here’s why:

1. **Professional Expertise**: PMS ensures active monitoring and management by experts with a dedicated research team.
2. **Better Returns**: With the right firm, you can expect consistent returns, often exceeding 15% CAGR over the long term (5+ years).
3. **Peace of Mind**: Delegating your portfolio management reduces stress and lets you focus on other priorities.

**My Recommendations**:  
Avoid smaller players like Liquide. Instead, consider reputed firms like **360One** and **Alchemy Capital**. Both have a proven track record and are trusted by many HNIs, including several of my own clients who are extremely happy with the performance and stability of their PMS investments.

post,1l3t1nh,Achieved 200% return on my portfolio in 5 yrs.. & still growing..,AdFlimsy4741,"Long-Term Investing: My Journey & Advice to New Investors 📈🌱

I started investing in the stock market in 2019–20, with a simple but powerful goal: buy and hold quality companies for the long term—15 to 20 years or more.

I’m not here to make a quick buck through intraday trading, gambling, or chasing trends. I’m here to build wealth slowly, steadily, and wisely.

I pick good businesses, with strong fundamental and growth potential. Once I invest, I simply hold on and let time do its magic.

📌 I don’t plan to sell.
📌 I’m in it for the compounding.
📌 I want to enjoy the dividends and peace of mind that come with owning part of great businesses.

To all new investors out there:

📉 Don’t fall for quick gains, tips, or FOMO.

📊 Choose quality over quantity.

⏳ Be patient—compounding rewards those who wait.

🧠 Learn, stay calm, and ignore the noise.

Long-term investing is not just rewarding—it’s life-changing.",2025-06-05 07:22:21,2414.0,332.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1l3t1nh/achieved_200_return_on_my_portfolio_in_5_yrs/,StockMarketIndia

On February 3, 2025, Bajaj Finance Ltd.'s shares surged by 5.28%, reaching a new 52-week high of ₹8,423.80, surpassing the previous peak of ₹8,249.95 set on January 30. This rise occurred despite a 0.41% decline in the BSE SENSEX Index. The trading volume for Bajaj Finance was notably higher at 170,405, compared to its 50-day average of 32,623. Strong loan growth and an 18% YoY profit surge drove optimism, with analysts raising targets to a ₹8,500 median.

Bajaj Finance experienced a strong bull run from June 2020 to August 2021, followed by sideways movement with consistent support along a trendline. Recently, it formed an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the trendline and broke out, gaining 6.5%. The stock is trading above the 20 SMA and 40 EMA on daily and weekly timeframes, with the RMI (Rohit Momentum Indicator) signaling a buy on both. For now, the stock is looking positive.

Open Interest (OI) is near record highs, indicating significant short built-up. Despite this, the stock has consistently formed higher lows, suggesting a triangle pattern with boundaries at ₹8000 and ₹6,520. Historically, such setups have led to sharp rallies if the stock breaks out on the upside. Conversely, a breakdown could lead to fresh OI highs and downward pressure.",2025-01-04 10:33:39,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1htbrk8/bajaj_finances_next_move_can_the_bulls_charge/,StockMarketIndia

UltraTech Cement is consolidating near its all-time high, with Bollinger Bands contracting—indicating a potential big move ahead. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is signaling a buy, and the stock is trading above the 20 EMA and 40 EMA, reflecting bullish momentum. Fresh OI additions at the 12,500 Call strike indicate bullish sentiment. This sets up a 500-point trading range, offering opportunities for breakout and momentum trades. Fresh OI additions at the 12500 call suggests that the call writers are shifting their position to 12500.

Bajaj Finance may see action in the coming sessions as it is resting on its support area. The momentum indicator is bullish with positive divergence on the daily chart, and the 1-year Price/Book Value (P/BV) is below its -1 SD, indicating potential undervaluation. A similar setup in August 2024 led to a 20% rally, and there's a chance the pattern could repeat.

post,1derz3u,Reached 1L profit in 1 year ,lifeofabaul,"I've been investing in stocks seriously since the past June. Had started with investing approx 25K in Adani enterprises as a bet for 2024 elections, but sold it in just one month with 500 rupees profit (could not handle the volatility), but by that time I had started getting interested in the basics of fundamental and technical analysis. I am not from a finance background but I am still trying my best to understand the concepts of finance (ROE, ROCE, ROA, cash flow statement, debt to equity etc.) mostly from YouTube channels (Basant Maheshwari, Invest in Bharat, etc). These are my stock picks in past 1 year. I would love to hear your views on my portfolio. The stocks did not perform well for the most of the year, and I was afraid that I won't even beat FD returns, however after election results things are changing for the better. My goal is to slowly concentrate the portfolio by reducing the companies to 9-10 in the next 3 years and keep investing for long term gains.

On February 3, 2025, Bajaj Finance Ltd.'s shares surged by 5.28%, reaching a new 52-week high of ₹8,423.80, surpassing the previous peak of ₹8,249.95 set on January 30. This rise occurred despite a 0.41% decline in the BSE SENSEX Index. The trading volume for Bajaj Finance was notably higher at 170,405, compared to its 50-day average of 32,623. Strong loan growth and an 18% YoY profit surge drove optimism, with analysts raising targets to a ₹8,500 median.

Bajaj Finance experienced a strong bull run from June 2020 to August 2021, followed by sideways movement with consistent support along a trendline. Recently, it formed an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the trendline and broke out, gaining 6.5%. The stock is trading above the 20 SMA and 40 EMA on daily and weekly timeframes, with the RMI (Rohit Momentum Indicator) signaling a buy on both. For now, the stock is looking positive.

Open Interest (OI) is near record highs, indicating significant short built-up. Despite this, the stock has consistently formed higher lows, suggesting a triangle pattern with boundaries at ₹8000 and ₹6,520. Historically, such setups have led to sharp rallies if the stock breaks out on the upside. Conversely, a breakdown could lead to fresh OI highs and downward pressure.",2025-01-04 10:37:02,2.0,3.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1htbt6n/bajaj_finances_next_move_can_the_bulls_charge/,IndianStreetBets

Bajaj Finance may see action in the coming sessions as it is resting on its support area. The momentum indicator is bullish with positive divergence on the daily chart, and the 1-year Price/Book Value (P/BV) is below its -1 SD, indicating potential undervaluation. A similar setup in August 2024 led to a 20% rally, and there's a chance the pattern could repeat.

UltraTech Cement is consolidating near its all-time high, with Bollinger Bands contracting—indicating a potential big move ahead. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is signaling a buy, and the stock is trading above the 20 EMA and 40 EMA, reflecting bullish momentum. Fresh OI additions at the 12,500 Call strike indicate bullish sentiment. This sets up a 500-point trading range, offering opportunities for breakout and momentum trades. Fresh OI additions at the 12500 call suggests that the call writers are shifting their position to 12500.
