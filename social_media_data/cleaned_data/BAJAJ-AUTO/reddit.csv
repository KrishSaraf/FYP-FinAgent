post,1kyfuxe,Bajaj Auto Q4: Profit up or down? Tired of media spin in financial reporting .Why is financial news so inconsistent?,Pristine_Chipmunk_61,"https://preview.redd.it/0qtta4lu3r3f1.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=66148602109d5f72998e5bc612bdb2f502309047

Just came across two different headlines for Bajaj Auto's Q4 FY25 results — Business Standard reports a **10% drop in net profit** to ₹1,801 crore, while Mint highlights a **rise in profit** compared to last quarter. 

The Business Standard headline sounds negative, even though operational performance improved and a dividend was declared. Mint’s take, on the other hand, seems more optimistic.

So, what's the truth? And more importantly — **why do business media outlets present such different narratives using the same numbers?**",2025-05-29 16:53:59,5.0,5.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1kyfuxe/bajaj_auto_q4_profit_up_or_down_tired_of_media/,IndianStockMarket

comment,1kyfuxe,,,,,,,mux3u1y,Arlysion,"Just open up their results and calculate yourself. Hardly takes a couple of minutes. News will always be inconsistent just because of the sheer amount of data they can put out and the way they interpret them. 


Revenues, Net and gross profits, ebit margins, ebitda and this can be QoQ or YoY just as an example. Consolidated statements standalone statements. Natcopharma missed estimates yesterday and expects a bad year ahead but most news organisations read profits up revenue up etc etc when in reality their margins contracted quite a bit. 


Just an example. Do your due diligence and don't rely on news for result interpretation cause they just want more viewership and will misrepresent information to gain it.",2025-05-29 17:30:19,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1kyfuxe/bajaj_auto_q4_profit_up_or_down_tired_of_media/,IndianStockMarket

post,1gbu0xz,The real reason behind the fall,JustDrop007,"Companies growing at 5% should not be valued at a 30 price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. Companies growing at 10% should not be valued at a 50 PE ratio. Companies that grow by 15-20% should not be expected to provide 100% returns.


This applies to companies like Nestlé, HUL, VBL, Siemens, ABB, Maruti, Mahindra, Bajaj Auto, Titan, and some PSUs like BHEL and Sun Pharma. These companies appear to be overvalued.

**Industry overview**  
  
  
India is a global production hub for two-wheelers – **a total of \~19.5 Mn 2W were produced in India in FY 2023 contributing 15-20% of the world’s total 2W production, making it the second largest 2W producer in the world after China**. Of the total production, \~4 Mn units were exported. **16-17 Mn units were sold domestically**. Globally, India is the second largest 2W market in terms of domestic sales volumes. Value of 2W domestic market size in India was Rs 1.4-1.6 Tn (US$17-20 Bn) in FY 2023. The TAM for 2W export from India is between Rs 7-8 Lakh cr. Markets like Africa, South East Asia provide an export opportunity for Indian OEM’s which further increases their TAM with an **export opportunity of around 100 million unit globally.**  
  
**E2W penetration in India is expected to expand from approximately 5.4%** ( China 85-90%) of domestic 2W registrations sales in Fiscal 2024 **to 41-56% of the domestic 2W** sales volume by Fiscal 2028, according to the Redseer Report. EVs have lower total cost of ownership (TCO) vs ICE vehicles, for e.g., electric two wheelers (that have led EV adoption in India) **have \~55% lower TCO vs their ICE counterparts** over the life of the vehicle. This is driven by lower fuel costs (roughly 1/10th of ICE) and other savings on vehicle spends (maintenance, registration subsidies)  
  
High fuel prices and the resulting total cost of ownership (TCO) have limited **2W penetration to \~160 2Ws per ‘000 people in India in CY 2022**, which is much lower than some of the SEA countries ( China 300-350, Indonesia 450-470), suggesting a large headroom for 2W growth ahead. Industry is projected to grow at 11% CAGR for next 5 years.  
  
**Premiumization trend**  
  
Segment share of entry level motorcycles have drastically reduced since FY20. Premium motorcycles and scooters are being sold more, as evident from segment share diagram.  
  
Multiple factors are pushing the personal mobility demand towards 2Ws:  
  
a. Need for affordable personal mobility  
b. Current state of road transport infrastructure  
c. Strong supply  
d. Last-mile mobility  
  
Affordable price segments dominate both scooters and motorcycles (including mopeds), with **86% and 82% of sales volumes respectively in less than Rs 1 lakh.**  


**Policies support for EV 2 wheelers**  
  
**Production-linked Incentive (PLI) Schemes –** In 2020, the government launched PLI scheme to boost domestic manufacturing, cut down import bills, encourage exports and generate employment. These incentives are linked to incremental sales of new-age technology products manufactured domestically.  
**Automobiles and auto components sector (budget: Rs 25900cr )**- The PLI proposes financial incentives of up to 18% (sales-linked) to boost domestic manufacturing of AAT products (min. 50% domestic value addition will be required) and attract investments. This scheme will be applicable from FY 2024 for a total of five consecutive financial years.  
  
**Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery (budget: Rs18100cr) Scheme** was launched for setting up ACC Battery Storage manufacturing facilities in India, with a total manufacturing capacity of 50 Giga Watt- hour (GWh) for 5 years.  
  
**India Semiconductor Mission 2021 (budget: ₹ 76000)**, included various schemes (such as semiconductor fabrication, display fabrication, compound semiconductor & semiconductor assembly, testing, making & packaging, and design-linked incentive).  
  
**Faster Adoption and Manufacturing (of Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME)**  
Subsidy phase I ( budget 900cr) was launched between FY15 and FY19 , phase II was launched between FY20 and FY24 ( Budget 10000cr)

**Points to consider**  


It is not clear due to range anxiety and safety issues, charging infra, whether 45-50% of EV 2 wheeler penetration is achievable by FY30. **Also, incumbents like Bajaj Auto and TVS are yet to expand EV across their entire network. Once they do, they might end up sweeping the market share from Ola Electric.**  
  
**Plus dealers of Ola electric won't survive selling only a few EVs, unit economics won' t permit that. In such a situation, network expansion, especially to Tier 2/3 cities ( where volumes are low) will be a challenge.**  
  
R&D and product development constitute 7.7% and 19.3% of revenues for FY24 and FY23 respectively.   
  
FAME II subsidies have been scaled down from 40% to 15% in Jun '23 , following which there was temporary drop in sales which recovered by festive season. In future, introducing such subsidies may play a pivotal role in EV 2wheeler sales.  
  
Ola plans to import 2 key components in cell manufacturing ( CAM and AAM) from China, which might face problems due to geopolitical issues in future.  
  
**Ola electric has 4 e-scooter models which constituted 98% of revenues in FY24, which is definitely a concentration risk.**  
  
Ola Electric is relatively new having 3 years experience in market, so they might face some issues which are unsolvable. ( provided they don't have any technology partner to guide). Plus due to lack of historic data, they may face problem of inventory management wrt variants and colours. They are trying to develop in-house cell manufacturing capabilities which, if faces issues will cause loss of product reputation in market.  
  
37% of parts are imported from suppliers outside India. Top 10 suppliers supplied 60% of parts.   
  
Employee attrition rates of 44% is too abnormal, needs to be looked into with caution.  
  
Profitability of Ola depends on availing PLI incentive schemes from GOI.  
  
Capacity utilisation of Ola electric stands at 49% in FY24, which affects its profitability and hinders from achieving economies of scale.  
  
Ola has related party transactions to the tune of 25% of revenues, one must dig deeper into those before investing.  
  
Battery cost being 30% of vehicle cost, if battery life is poor then Ola scooters will earn bad reputation in market ( full cycle of battery is yet to be seen in most vehicles).  
  
  
**Valuation**  
  
Ola electric is valued at P/S of 6.69, whereas TVS at 3.11, Eicher at 7.87, Hero at 2.79, Bajaj at 5.82. PE ratio wise TVS  74, Bajaj 34, Eicher 32, Hero 28.

comment,1eifeze,,,,,,,lg6ztmt,OneCuriousBrain,"TLDR;

### Pros:
1. **Market Position**: Ola Electric is the largest manufacturer of EV 2-wheelers in India with a significant market share of 35%.
2. **Integrated Manufacturing**: The Ola Futurefactory is the largest integrated and automated E2W manufacturing plant in India, providing a robust production capacity.
3. **Innovative Technology**: Ola's R&D efforts and the MoveOS platform demonstrate a commitment to technological advancement and product innovation.
4. **Policy Support**: Various government schemes like the PLI and FAME II subsidies provide financial incentives and support to boost EV manufacturing.
5. **Expansion Plans**: The development of the EV hub and Gigafactory in Tamil Nadu indicates a strong focus on future growth and independence in cell manufacturing.
6. **Growing Sales**: Rapid sales growth from 14,393 scooters in FY22 to 328,940 scooters in FY24 shows increasing demand and market acceptance.
7. **Cost Efficiency**: High component commonality across models helps drive down costs and streamline production.

### Cons:
1. **Financial Performance**: Despite revenue growth, Ola Electric is still operating at a loss with a PAT loss of ₹1580 crore in FY24 and negative EBITDA margins.
2. **Debt Levels**: The company's debt to equity ratio is relatively high at 1.34, indicating significant leverage which could be a risk if not managed well.
3. **Employee Attrition**: High employee attrition rates (44%) could impact operational stability and R&D productivity.
4. **Dependence on Subsidies**: The reduction in FAME II subsidies had a temporary negative impact on sales, indicating reliance on government support.
5. **Market Risks**: Incumbent players like Bajaj Auto and TVS could potentially capture market share once they expand their EV offerings.
6. **Concentration Risk**: Four scooter models constitute 98% of revenues, leading to a high concentration risk.
7. **Supply Chain Issues**: Dependence on imported parts (37% of total) and geopolitical risks related to sourcing key components from China could impact production.
8. **Valuation**: At a P/S ratio of 6.69, Ola Electric is valued higher than some competitors like TVS (3.11) and Hero (2.79), raising questions about its relative valuation.",2024-08-02 20:04:44,41.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1eifeze/ola_electric_ipo_analysis/,IndianStockMarket

Even though the local passenger vehicle segment has high growth potential and been doing well recently it’s not a significant part of Tata motors.  Also historically Tata motors have been having high result fluctuations with high debt it is definitely on the lower end of the PE ratio compared to Maruti. 
Although I believe tata motors can overcome these problems in the longterm and we could see a PE spike afterwards. Market is currently undervaluing to a certain extent.

post,1j47jts,2 Wheeler deep dive,GodofObertan,"2 wheeler market -

Domestic 2 wheeler market is ~1.3-1.4 lakh market with an operating profit pool of around ~14000-15000 crores.

Top 4 players command over 80% domestic market share in 2 wheelers.

Post 2019 peak, volumes in 2024 are still 14% lower than peak, FY25 volumes may end up somewhere between 2018 and 2019 numbers, a shade below peak seen in 2019.


Industry mapping -

2 wheeler market can be broadly classified into 4 sub-segments -

<125 CC / 125-250 CC / >250 CC and Scooters

Segments which are going the fastest are >250 CC / Scooters / 125-250 CC whereas <125 CC has been de-growing due to price hikes because of regulatory norms and higher commodity prices.

Where are the companies placed ?

Hero Moto Corp garners more than 80% of domestic volumes from <125 CC bikes (Splendor and HF Deluxe) whereas 12% of volumes are from 125-250 CC

TVS garners 61% of domestic volumes from Scooters and Mopeds (Jupiter) and 27% of volumes from 125-250 CC

Bajaj Auto garners 67% of domestic volumes from 125-250 CC and 26% from <125CC

Eicher garners 100% of volumes from >250 CC

Honda (Unlisted) garners 56% of volumes from Scooters and 36% from 125-250 CC


Market share trends -

Key players in 2 wheelers by market share in FY 24 are

Hero MotoCorp - 29.3%

Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India - 24.5%

TVS - 17.1%

Bajaj Auto - 12.1%

Suzuki - 5%

Eicher Motors - 4.5%

Other players in 2W space are Yamaha, Ola, Ather, Greaves Mobility, WardWizard Innovation.


Over the past 5 years, Hero MotoCorp has lost market share with TVS being a key beneficiary of market share.

Key reason for market share loss for Hero MotoCorp can be attributed to struggling <125 CC segment while not having a meaningful pressure in growth segments in Scooters and 125-250 CC.

TVS increase in market share can be directly attributed to a much higher presence in growth segments Scooters and 125-250 CC


What are the Top Selling 2 wheelers in India ?


Exports -

Exports is another key driver driving ~20% of volumes for the Industry.

Exports market is ~32000 crores with Asia and Africa contributing ~81% of the volumes.

Nigeria is one of the largest countries for exports for Indian companies followed by Philippines, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Egypt and Nepal and Columbia.

Exports over the past few years have struggled due to currency challenges in Key geographies such as Nigeria, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Egypt, though is recovering sharply.


Bajaj Auto is the largest exporter of 2 wheelers in the country contributing ~50% of exports from the country.

Exports of 2 wheelers contribute ~35% / ~25% / ~9% / ~5% to Bajaj Auto / TVS / Eicher Motors and Hero Moto Corp


EV -

EV penetration as on FY24 stands at ~5.1% . As of FYTD25, penetration stands at 5.8%. EV growth has been ~30-35%.

99% of volumes are in EV scooters and EV penetration in scooters is ~16%.


EV is an evolving market, with material market share shifts every month. We use a 3M moving average to arrive at market share and it is a better reflection of prospective market share.

As of December. Ola is the largest E2W followed by TVS, Bajaj, Ather and Hero.


Honda’s Activa and Suzuki’s E-Access deliveries in the next few months will result in market share moderation for all the above peers.

How has FY25 been for 2 wheelers and where are they placed ?

2W have been the fastest growing sector in FY25 so far, seeing ~10.6% growth till December 2024. 2 wheelers are set for the second highest volumes delivered ever.


Suzuki and Honda has been the fastest growing domestic company growing over 29% / 23% YTD followed by TVS at 13.6%.

The scooter portfolio of the incumbents continues to materially outgrow the bikes portfolio.

Bajaj, Hero and Eicher volumes have been in the 6-8% growth rate.


There are pockets where each of the companies are placed which can benefit them, broad one liner for where each company is placed and what can help them grow faster.

Hero MotoCorp -

What’s happening - Hero has been continuously losing market share due to a weak EV and Scooter portfolio , 125-250CC and entry level 100 CC not doing well due to stress in rural economy.

When can Hero Outperform - If Rural recovery is sharp and faster than Urban recovery and if Hero(+Ather) continues to hold material market share in the EV segment.

TVS Motors -

What’s happening - TVS has been continuously garnering market share due to a strong Scooter and 125-250 CC portfolio.

When can TVS underperform - TVS Portfolio is at the highest risk of electrification (~61% of volumes in Scooters and Mopeds) resulting in probable material market share loss. EV market share is a key monitorable.

Bajaj Auto -

What’s happening -

Bajaj has been growing in-line with market owing to a decent 125-250 CC portfolio.

However, Bajaj Auto derives ~40% of exports from 2&3W and exports have been under pressure.

When can Bajaj Auto outperform -

Strong recovery in Africa and South Asia primarily Nigeria, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other countries.

Bajaj’s EV market share is rapidly increasing and if they are to maintain the same in long run

3W portfolio contributes ~15% of volumes, Strong 3W performance can help Bajaj Auto.

Eicher Motors -

What’s happening -

Eicher Motors has been losing market share as >250CC market has seen increased competitive intensity from Bajaj Triumph and Hero with Harley Davidson.

When can Eicher outperform -

Eicher’s ability to stay ahead of the curve in innovation and garnering market share in >250 CC and premium bikes

Exports growing materially faster (currently only 9% of volumes)

Ola - Ola’s success or failure will be determined by EV market share

Other listed players

Greaves Electric Mobility - Ampere

Disagree on one point though - you mention tvs is most vulnerable to electrification of 2w. Do you know the largest selling ev 2w in India?

TVS iQube.

Of the whole 2w pack tvs is best placed I feel.

TVS has around 30 percent odd market share in Scooters and Moped. Bajaj had 0 and Hero has 3 percent. 

Post EV, TVS has around 20, Bajaj is at 20 and Hero + Ather is at 17-18. 

Honda is the largest scooter company, with launch of Activa in next 1 year, we'll see everyone's EV market share collapse. Thanks.",2025-03-05 19:46:02,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1j47jts/2_wheeler_deep_dive/,IndianStockMarket

FIIs have sold more than 70,000cr in October so far.


There are fears in the market that there is a slowdown in the consumption in India looking at the Q2 numbers. This has become one of the sentiment spoiler.


Nestle has shown volume degrowth.

Bajaj Auto’s numbers also failed to impress the street

All these products indicate the consumption volumes of the market.

There are no fireworks in the Wipro and Infosys results

Israel kills Hamas chief. This could be a beginning to end the war.

US markets had a muted session yesterday. Futures are trading flat. US 10Y Bond Yield is at 4%. Brent Oil is at 74$. Dollar Index is above 103. Gold makes a new all time high. Asian markets are mixed. Consider global cues as weak today.

24694 is the level to watch today. Why is this critical? This was the low, Nifty made in this month during its recent fall. After this Nifty attempted to recover and faced resistance at 25300 zone. Selling emerged and now it is back to test that low again today.

To give you some comfort and energy. I am bullish in the long term and confident that I will make good money by buying during this correction. Absolutely relaxed and not at all fearful.

Extra

post,1jfpoxe,Commercial Vehicles and 3 W deep dive,GodofObertan,"You can read the article (has some charts and images for better readability) 

https://cashcows.substack.com/p/all-you-need-to-know-2-automobile-686


CV’s are broadly classified into Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV’s) and Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicles (MHCV’s).

LCVs include vans, pickup trucks, and small delivery trucks, while MHCVs include large tractor-trailers, dump trucks, and heavy-duty delivery trucks.

Broadly CV market is ~2,00,000 crores market with MHCV is ~1,30,000 crore market whereas LCV’s being ~70000 crores market.

Both MHCV and LCV are ~5% and ~3% lower than peak levels.



MHCV Market Share -

MHCV is a larger segment with 3 large players, Tata Motors (~47% MS), Ashok Leyland (~31%) )and Volvo-Eicher CV (~8.2%).

MHCV have smaller players in sub-segments such as SML Isuzu (buses), Mahindra, and Olectra Greentech  (e-buses)

Tata Motors over past 10 years has lost ~800 bps primarily to Ashok Leyland and VECV (~600 and ~200 bps respectively)


LCV’s on the other hand has 2 large players i.e Mahindra (~43% MS) and Tata Motors (~34% MS), with Ashok Leyland and Force Motors being the smaller players. M&M has overtaken Tata Motors to be the largest LCV player in India.


E-CV’s -

ECV’s have the lowest penetration at 0.4%, the only sub-segment which has grown faster has been E-bus due to government bus and E-bus penetration has been higher than E-4 W.


How has the year been for CV’s in FY25 so far ?


CV has seen a de-growth of 1% for first 9M, and most companies expects similiar performance in Q4.

LCV’s has de-grown by 3% whereas MHCV’s have been flat.



Ashok Leyland - Benefits largely on account of strong MHCV Cycle

Tata CV - (will list on stock markets soon post demerger of Tata Motors) - Benefits from strong MHCV and LCV cycle.

Mahindra - Benefits largely on account of strong MHCV Cycle

VECV - Benefits largely on account of Strong MHCV cycle. VECV is ~15% for Eicher Motors.

Olectra Greentech - Can benefit disproportionately if E-bus penetration increases materially and companies garner higher incremental market share

SML Isuzu - Bus portfolio doing well

Force Motors - Benefits largely on account of strong LCV cycle and particular categories such as ambulances.

Share

3 W -

3 wheeler Indian market is ~20000-22000 crore market with domestic 3 wheeler market being ~15000 crores and Export market is ~7500 crores.

3 wheelers are primarily goods and passenger rickshaws. Bajaj Auto is the largest player in India, followed by Piaggio and Mahindra. 3 wheeler volumes are 7% below it’s all time high volumes in 2020.


Bajaj Auto is the largest 3W player in the country followed by Piaggio and Mahindra. Other smaller players include Atul Auto and TVS domestic


EV -

3W has the highest EV penetration with ~15.6% on conventional 3W. If you include low voltage E-3W, (found in Delhi / Jaipur among other cities) EV penetration is already a ~56%


There are a lot E-3 W companies who have raised private capital (below list with last round valuation) and may get listed in the future

• Mahindra LMM - ~6600 crores

• Altigreen Propulsion system - ~2500 crores

• Euler Motors - ~1300 crores

•Atul Greentech – 983 crores

How has 3 W performed -

3W growth has been decent at 6% for first 9M.


Companies and exposure to 3W -

Atul Auto is the only pure-play 3 W listed player currently.

Bajaj Auto and TVS derives ~15% / 5% of revenues from 3W.



Conclusion - Broadly CV has seen de-growth in FY25 so far, No material outliers have been identified across segments in CV. Growth in CV’s is likely to be muted over the near future. Interest rate cut can materially aid CV cycle.

Broadly, there are 6 listed CV players which can disproportionately benefit depending on CV scenario.

 3W market evolution is a great primer for how auto-sector will evolve in electrification over the next few years and a lot of opportunities will develop and evolve in 3W space.

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1gerc0j,"Indian Stock Market Update – October 29, 2024: Mixed Signals and Diwali Muhurat Trading Vibes! 🎉📈",Ok-Jackfruit1957,"Hey folks! Here’s a quick look at what’s happening in the Indian stock market as of October 29, 2024. It’s been a bit of a mixed bag lately, with some sectors holding strong while others dip. Here’s the lowdown:

# 📊 Today’s Market Vibe

* **NIFTY 50**: Ended at **24,399.40**, down a smidge **0.15%** (-36.10 points).
* **SENSEX**: Slightly dipped to **80,065.16**, down **0.02%** (-16.82 points).
* **NIFTY BANK**: Showed some muscle, closing up **0.57%** at **51,531.15**.
* **NIFTY IT**: Dropped by **0.19%** (closed at **42,139.85**).
* Sector-wise, most indexes did alright on October 28, with PSU Banks and Metals leading the way.

# 🚀 Top Movers to Watch

**Top Gainers:**

* **Shriram Finance** popped up by **5.39%**! Other big gainers include **Adani Enterprises**, **ICICI Bank**, and **Wipro**.

**Top Losers:**

* **Coal India** took a hit, down **4.22%**, and companies like Bajaj Auto and Axis Bank also slid a bit.

# 🧐 Market Trends

The market had a nice little rebound on October 28 after a rough five-day losing streak, with strong buying in banking and metal sectors. But, heads up! NIFTY is nearing a resistance level at **24,500**, so things could get interesting.

# 🌏 Economy Check-In

While the market’s looking okay for now, analysts are hinting at possible bumps ahead—high valuations and slowing earnings growth could spell some trouble. Earnings downgrades might be lurking around the corner.

# 🎉 What’s Next?

* **Muhurat Trading**: A special Muhurat Trading session for Diwali! A lot of people see it as a good time to kick off new investments, so we might see some added action.
* **Upcoming Holiday**: Markets will be closed on **November 1** for Diwali (Laxmi Pujan).
* **Big Earnings on Deck**: Tech and banking giants are dropping their earnings reports this week, so we’ll see if they shake things up.

# 💭 Final Thoughts

The market’s got a “wait and see” vibe right now. With Diwali trades, holiday closures, and earnings reports all lined up, it’s a good time to keep an eye on sector-specific plays.",2024-10-29 10:28:47,3.0,3.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gerc0j/indian_stock_market_update_october_29_2024_mixed/,IndianStockMarket

post,1dvymx1,Realtime Stock News Tracker : Beta Testing & Suggestions,HistoricalAd4543,"Hi, I was looking for a tool which can track all news related to stocks in realtime from various sources at one place. I could not find any such tool. Used moneycontrol portal and forum for tracking various news and chatter related to a particular stock but it has become super annoying due to ADs every 10-15 sec. So, I have built a simple tracker. What it does is:

* It tracks several sources like, ET, BS, News Portals etc.
* Stock wise news notifications / section
* Can be used as a forum for discussion about a particular stock

Currently, it solves my purpose of accessing all news related to a stock at one place. But, I want to develop it further and add more sources / information. Can also add stock specific information like various technical indicators, chart patterns, bulk deal etc.

It would be great if few of you guys can use it and let me know if it is useful and what improvements can be made in it.

Some stocks only exist just so the promoters can pay themselves/ fill their pockets 

These companies shares trade about 50-80, some even about 100-200, they are barely known to the public.

Very less trading activity (volumes) Few hands involved 

They pay dividends in 100's or 1000's

I don't remember properly but I have seen a share price of about

post,1j4ypgm,Commercial Vehicles and 3 W deep Dive.,GodofObertan,"Commercial Vehicles (CV’s) -

CV’s are broadly classified into Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV’s) and Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicles (MHCV’s).

LCVs include vans, pickup trucks, and small delivery trucks, while MHCVs include large tractor-trailers, dump trucks, and heavy-duty delivery trucks.

Broadly CV market is ~2,00,000 crores market with MHCV is ~1,30,000 crore market whereas LCV’s being ~70000 crores market.

Both MHCV and LCV are ~5% and ~3% lower than peak levels.



MHCV Market Share -

MHCV is a larger segment with 3 large players, Tata Motors (~47% MS), Ashok Leyland (~31%) )and Volvo-Eicher CV (~8.2%).

MHCV have smaller players in sub-segments such as SML Isuzu (buses), Mahindra, Olectra Greentech and JBM Auto (e-buses)

Tata Motors over past 10 years has lost ~800 bps primarily to Ashok Leyland and VECV (~600 and ~200 bps respectively)


LCV’s on the other hand has 2 large players i.e Mahindra (~43% MS) and Tata Motors (~34% MS), with Ashok Leyland and Force Motors being the smaller players. M&M has overtaken Tata Motors to be the largest LCV player in India.


E-CV’s -

ECV’s have the lowest penetration at 0.4%, the only sub-segment which has grown faster has been E-bus due to government bus and E-bus penetration has been higher than E-4 W.


How has the year been for CV’s in FY25 so far ?


CV has seen a de-growth of 1% for first 9M, and most companies expects similiar performance in Q4.

LCV’s has de-grown by 3% whereas MHCV’s have been flat.



Ashok Leyland - Benefits largely on account of strong MHCV Cycle

Tata CV - (will list on stock markets soon post demerger of Tata Motors) - Benefits from strong MHCV and LCV cycle.

Mahindra - Benefits largely on account of strong MHCV Cycle

VECV - Benefits largely on account of Strong MHCV cycle. VECV is ~15% for Eicher Motors.

JBM Auto and Olectra Greentech - Can benefit disproportionately if E-bus penetration increases materially and companies garner higher incremental market share

SML Isuzu - Bus portfolio doing well

Force Motors - Benefits largely on account of strong LCV cycle and particular categories such as ambulances.

Share

3 W -

3 wheeler Indian market is ~20000-22000 crore market with domestic 3 wheeler market being ~15000 crores and Export market is ~7500 crores.

3 wheelers are primarily goods and passenger rickshaws. Bajaj Auto is the largest player in India, followed by Piaggio and Mahindra. 3 wheeler volumes are 7% below it’s all time high volumes in 2020.


Bajaj Auto is the largest 3W player in the country followed by Piaggio and Mahindra. Other smaller players include Atul Auto and TVS domestic


EV -

3W has the highest EV penetration with ~15.6% on conventional 3W. If you include low voltage E-3W, (found in Delhi / Jaipur among other cities) EV penetration is already a ~56%


There are a lot E-3 W companies who have raised private capital (below list with last round valuation) and may get listed in the future

• Mahindra LMM - ~6600 crores

• Altigreen Propulsion system - ~2500 crores

• Euler Motors - ~1300 crores

•Atul Greentech – 983 crores

How has 3 W performed -

3W growth has been decent at 6% for first 9M.


Companies and exposure to 3W -

Atul Auto is the only pure-play 3 W listed player currently.

Bajaj Auto and TVS derives ~15% / 5% of revenues from 3W.



Conclusion - Broadly CV has seen de-growth in FY25 so far, No material outliers have been identified across segments in CV. Growth in CV’s is likely to be muted over the near future. Interest rate cut can materially aid CV cycle.

Broadly, there are 6 listed CV players which can disproportionately benefit depending on CV scenario.

 3W market evolution is a great primer for how auto-sector will evolve in electrification over the next few years and a lot of opportunities will develop and evolve in 3W space.

post,1i9i3j3,Deep diving into 2 Wheelers in India,GodofObertan,"Let’s start with the basics -

OEM’s can be broadly classified into sub-segments i.e. -

2W – Scooters / Mopeds / Bikes

4W – Small (Hatchback and Sedans) and Large Cars (SUV’s and Van’s)

3W – Goods and Passengers Rickshaws

CV – Tempo’s, Trucks, Buses etc. (LCV / MHCV )

Agri-Equipment – Tractors, Tillers etc.

Construction Equipment – Cranes , Backhoe loaders, Excavators etc.

The first section will be focusing on 2 wheelers -

2 wheeler market -

Domestic 2 wheeler market is ~1.3-1.4 lakh market with an operating profit pool of around ~14000-15000 crores.

Top 4 players command over 80% domestic market share in 2 wheelers.

Post 2019 peak, volumes in 2024 are still 14% lower than peak, FY25 volumes may end up somewhere between 2018 and 2019 numbers, a shade below peak seen in 2019.


Industry mapping -

2 wheeler market can be broadly classified into 4 sub-segments -

<125 CC / 125-250 CC / >250 CC and Scooters

Segments which are going the fastest are >250 CC / Scooters / 125-250 CC whereas <125 CC has been de-growing due to price hikes because of regulatory norms and higher commodity prices.

Where are the companies placed ?

Hero Moto Corp garners more than 80% of domestic volumes from <125 CC bikes (Splendor and HF Deluxe) whereas 12% of volumes are from 125-250 CC

TVS garners 61% of domestic volumes from Scooters and Mopeds (Jupiter) and 27% of volumes from 125-250 CC

Bajaj Auto garners 67% of domestic volumes from 125-250 CC and 26% from <125CC

Eicher garners 100% of volumes from >250 CC

Honda (Unlisted) garners 56% of volumes from Scooters and 36% from 125-250 CC


Market share trends -

Key players in 2 wheelers by market share in FY 24 are

Hero MotoCorp - 29.3%

Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India - 24.5%

TVS - 17.1%

Bajaj Auto - 12.1%

Suzuki - 5%

Eicher Motors - 4.5%

Other players in 2W space are Yamaha, Ola, Ather, Greaves Mobility, WardWizard Innovation.


Over the past 5 years, Hero MotoCorp has lost market share with TVS being a key beneficiary of market share.

Key reason for market share loss for Hero MotoCorp can be attributed to struggling <125 CC segment while not having a meaningful pressure in growth segments in Scooters and 125-250 CC.

TVS increase in market share can be directly attributed to a much higher presence in growth segments Scooters and 125-250 CC

What are the Top Selling 2 wheelers in India ?


Exports -

Exports is another key driver driving ~20% of volumes for the Industry.

Exports market is ~32000 crores with Asia and Africa contributing ~81% of the volumes.

Nigeria is one of the largest countries for exports for Indian companies followed by Philippines, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Egypt and Nepal and Columbia.

Exports over the past few years have struggled due to currency challenges in Key geographies such as Nigeria, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Egypt, though is recovering sharply.


Bajaj Auto is the largest exporter of 2 wheelers in the country contributing ~50% of exports from the country.

Exports of 2 wheelers contribute ~35% / ~25% / ~9% / ~5% to Bajaj Auto / TVS / Eicher Motors and Hero Moto Corp


EV -

EV penetration as on FY24 stands at ~5.1% . As of FYTD25, penetration stands at 5.8%. EV growth has been ~30-35%.

99% of volumes are in EV scooters and EV penetration in scooters is ~16%.


EV is an evolving market, with material market share shifts every month. We use a 3M moving average to arrive at market share and it is a better reflection of prospective market share.

As of December. Ola is the largest E2W followed by TVS, Bajaj, Ather and Hero.


Honda’s Activa and Suzuki’s E-Access deliveries in the next few months will result in market share moderation for all the above peers.


How has FY25 been for 2 wheelers and where are they placed ?

2W have been the fastest growing sector in FY25 so far, seeing ~10.6% growth till December 2024. 2 wheelers are set for the second highest volumes delivered ever.


Suzuki and Honda has been the fastest growing domestic company growing over 29% / 23% YTD followed by TVS at 13.6%.

The scooter portfolio of the incumbents continues to materially outgrow the bikes portfolio.

Bajaj, Hero and Eicher volumes have been in the 6-8% growth rate.


There are pockets where each of the companies are placed which can benefit them, broad one liner for where each company is placed and what can help them grow faster.

Hero MotoCorp -

What’s happening - Hero has been continuously losing market share due to a weak EV and Scooter portfolio , 125-250CC and entry level 100 CC not doing well due to stress in rural economy.

When can Hero Outperform - If Rural recovery is sharp and faster than Urban recovery and if Hero(+Ather) continues to hold material market share in the EV segment.

TVS Motors -

What’s happening - TVS has been continuously garnering market share due to a strong Scooter and 125-250 CC portfolio.

When can TVS underperform - TVS Portfolio is at the highest risk of electrification (~61% of volumes in Scooters and Mopeds) resulting in probable material market share loss. EV market share is a key monitorable.

Bajaj Auto -

What’s happening -

Bajaj has been growing in-line with market owing to a decent 125-250 CC portfolio.

However, Bajaj Auto derives ~40% of exports from 2&3W and exports have been under pressure.

When can Bajaj Auto outperform -

Strong recovery in Africa and South Asia primarily Nigeria, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other countries.

Bajaj’s EV market share is rapidly increasing and if they are to maintain the same in long run

3W portfolio contributes ~15% of volumes, Strong 3W performance can help Bajaj Auto.

Eicher Motors -

What’s happening -

Eicher Motors has been losing market share as >250CC market has seen increased competitive intensity from Bajaj Triumph and Hero with Harley Davidson.

When can Eicher outperform -

Eicher’s ability to stay ahead of the curve in innovation and garnering market share in >250 CC and premium bikes

Exports growing materially faster (currently only 9% of volumes)

Ola - Ola’s success or failure will be determined by EV market share

Other listed players

Greaves Electric Mobility - Ampere

Rattan India Enterprises - Revolt

WardWizard Innovation - Joy E-bikes

Conclusion - Broadly 2W is the best performing sub-segment in FY25 so far and is expected to be the fastest growing segment in FY25.

post,1hfgp9k,Highlights of PPFAS unit holders meet 2024^,Intrepid_Self4652,"We had a productive meeting with the [PPFAS Mutual Fund](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ppfas-mutual-fund/) team, which included [Rajeev Thakkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeev-thakkar-715b3b1b1/), [Raunak Onkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raunakonkar/), [Neil Parikh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-parikh-465b98187/), [Raj Mehta, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-mehta-cfa-8b8630a1/), [Rukun Tarachandani, CFA, CQF](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rukun-tarachandani-cfa-cqf-19765518/) & [Mansi Kariya, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansi-kariya-cfa/). Here are the highlights:  
  
Ø Achieving financial goals > beating benchmarks  
Ø Investment success is driven by asset allocation and compounding duration over individual stock/scheme selection  
Ø Midcap starts at 80k cr market cap and small-cap at 25k crore - no concerns regarding PPFAS Flexi Cap AUM  
Ø 4.5 lakh crores are invested in thematic/sectoral funds  
Ø No update from RBI on overseas investments. This question is asked to new governor now  
Ø Optimistic on India, but cautious due to high valuations. 80% invested but maintain 20% cash  
Ø Promoters are selling stakes (e.g., Whirlpool, Hyundai, LG, Walmart in Flipkart), while QIP activity and PE exits increase. Retail investors focus on SIPs, while promoters find value in QIPs  
Ø Okay to lose 50% of clients through redemptions than losing 50% of clients’ money by doing foolish things on investment side  
Ø Exposure to AI through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. Solar exposure is via transmission companies  
Ø Conservative Hybrid Funds cap equity at 25%. DAAF has a minimum of 35% equity. CHF taxation is as per slab rates, while DAAF offers LTCG benefits beyond 2 years. CHF can invest in REITs/InvITs; DAAF cannot  
Ø Rising investments in small-cap, mid-cap, thematic funds, AIFs, PMS, and smallcases explain their resilience in current market relative to large companies  
Ø BSE was a miss. Thought NSE would be a dominant player, but BSE made a remarkable comeback. Participated through CDSL.  
Ø Maruti (PF stock) – Only a pure four-wheeler play (others have commercial vehicle, investments in other subsidiary) – tracking M&M, Tata motors too. Maruti have missed on SUV, EV front but its fine – as technologies are still evolving  
Ø Sold UTI AMC & Bajaj Auto due to valuations. Question on capital markets – due to new IND AS, earnings volatility has increased a lot. Capital market business is inherently volatile and IND AS have made them more. Run up in stocks has gone up – so trimmed/sold  
Ø ITC – Not as attractive as it was when we bought. Still reasonable valued now. On ITC Hotels – demerged and asset-light  
Ø Overall investment returns are driven by three factors: Dividend yield, Earnings growth, P/E multiple (going up/steady/down)  
Ø Liquidity – to be looked from 2-3 factors in conjunction. First – how much of your investment strategy depends upon the churn (buy and hold ours). Second – Client concentration (less than 2% for our #1 client)  
Ø In India, perception has built up mid/small cap co.s will do well than large caps. In USA, its reverse. Not always true.  
Ø HDFC Bank being a biggie does not mean it’s at a disadvantage  
Ø Smaller AUM of PPFAS Tax saver does not give advantage to PPFAS Flexi. We follow the same approach. Just – no foreign stocks & arbitrage allowed. Tax saver – min. 80% invested all time. Flexi – 65%.

Ø PPFAS DAAF maintains a fixed income duration of 3.25–3.5 years  
Ø On government regulation – you cannot avoid this is probably any sector (pvt or public)  
Ø Exited Accelya Kale due to concerns over its parent’s product roadmap  
Ø Missed Nvidia. Fundamental assumption was wrong in this case.  
Ø Succession plan – we have alignment of interests. Financially: ESOPs, investments in PPFAS units, on the same page on strategy, organization moving forward. Built a relationship that has passed professional things.  
Ø Exploring a new asset class (10L min.) under evolving guidelines  
Ø No plans for the AMC IPO for next couple of years  
Ø On ESG: Governance – we consider this even before ESG was a thing. E & S part – neutral. Business is not black & white.  
Ø Real estate is difficult for conviction-led investing, but proxies look attractive. Book – Inside Real Estate by Sushil Sayal. Surprised if we buy any RE developer in next 3-6 months.  
Ø We do track momentum, factor based (volatility of business etc.). Models are built to identify long term trends  
Ø Hiring a financial advisor is one of the best investments.  
Ø A mistake is not where a stock price went down, or its good thing if it went up. These are an outcome. Process > Outcome.

Ø Not considering investment in China

In August 2023, Ola also announced a line-up of motorcycles comprising four models.  
  
The Ola Futurefactory is the largest integrated and automated E2W manufacturing plant in India in terms of production capacity **(** **total installed capacity of 6.79 lakh per annum)** They have R &D facilities in India, UK and the US. Ola Electric manufactures EVs and certain core EV components like battery packs, motors and vehicle frames at the Ola Futurefactory. They are also building EV hub in Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts in Tamil Nadu, which is expected to span up to 2,000 acres of land, and includes Ola Futurefactory, **upcoming Ola Gigafactory for cell manufacturing in Krishnagiri district** and co-located suppliers in Krishnagiri district. Their products Ola S1 Air and S1 Pro ( Gen2) are eligible under PLI incentive scheme where they will get 13-18% of sales value.

**Industry overview**  
  
  
India is a global production hub for two-wheelers – **a total of \~19.5 Mn 2W were produced in India in FY 2023 contributing 15-20% of the world’s total 2W production, making it the second largest 2W producer in the world after China**. Of the total production, \~4 Mn units were exported. **16-17 Mn units were sold domestically**. Globally, India is the second largest 2W market in terms of domestic sales volumes. Value of 2W domestic market size in India was Rs 1.4-1.6 Tn (US$17-20 Bn) in FY 2023. The TAM for 2W export from India is between Rs 7-8 Lakh cr. Markets like Africa, South East Asia provide an export opportunity for Indian OEM’s which further increases their TAM with an **export opportunity of around 100 million unit globally.**

  
**E2W penetration in India is expected to expand from approximately 5.4%** ( China 85-90%) of domestic 2W registrations sales in Fiscal 2024 **to 41-56% of the domestic 2W** sales volume by Fiscal 2028, according to the Redseer Report. EVs have lower total cost of ownership (TCO) vs ICE vehicles, for e.g., electric two wheelers (that have led EV adoption in India) **have \~55% lower TCO vs their ICE counterparts** over the life of the vehicle. This is driven by lower fuel costs (roughly 1/10th of ICE) and other savings on vehicle spends (maintenance, registration subsidies)  
  
High fuel prices and the resulting total cost of ownership (TCO) have limited **2W penetration to \~160 2Ws per ‘000 people in India in CY 2022**, which is much lower than some of the SEA countries ( China 300-350, Indonesia 450-470), suggesting a large headroom for 2W growth ahead. Industry is projected to grow at 11% CAGR for next 5 years.  
  
**Premiumization trend**  
Segment share of entry level motorcycles have drastically reduced since FY20. Premium motorcycles and scooters are being sold more, as evident from segment share diagram.  
  
Multiple factors are pushing the personal mobility demand towards 2Ws:  
  
a. Need for affordable personal mobility  
b. Current state of road transport infrastructure  
c. Strong supply  
d. Last-mile mobility  
  
Affordable price segments dominate both scooters and motorcycles (including mopeds), with **86% and 82% of sales volumes respectively in less than Rs 1 lakh.**  
**Policies support for EV 2 wheelers**  
  
**Production-linked Incentive (PLI) Schemes –** In 2020, the government launched PLI scheme to boost domestic manufacturing, cut down import bills, encourage exports and generate employment. These incentives are linked to incremental sales of new-age technology products manufactured domestically.  
**Automobiles and auto components sector (budget: Rs 25900cr )**- The PLI proposes financial incentives of up to 18% (sales-linked) to boost domestic manufacturing of AAT products (min. 50% domestic value addition will be required) and attract investments. This scheme will be applicable from FY 2024 for a total of five consecutive financial years.  
  
**Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery (budget: Rs18100cr) Scheme** was launched for setting up ACC Battery Storage manufacturing facilities in India, with a total manufacturing capacity of 50 Giga Watt- hour (GWh) for 5 years.  
  
**India Semiconductor Mission 2021 (budget: ₹ 76000)**, included various schemes (such as semiconductor fabrication, display fabrication, compound semiconductor & semiconductor assembly, testing, making & packaging, and design-linked incentive).  
  
**Faster Adoption and Manufacturing (of Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME)**  
Subsidy phase I ( budget 900cr) was launched between FY15 and FY19 , phase II was launched between FY20 and FY24 ( Budget 10000cr)

**Points to consider**  


It is not clear due to range anxiety and safety issues, charging infra, whether 45-50% of EV 2 wheeler penetration is achievable by FY30. **Also, incumbents like Bajaj Auto and TVS are yet to expand EV across their entire network. Once they do, they might end up sweeping the market share from Ola Electric.**  
  
**Plus dealers of Ola electric won't survive selling only a few EVs, unit economics won' t permit that. In such a situation, network expansion, especially to Tier 2/3 cities ( where volumes are low) will be a challenge.**  
  
R&D and product development constitute 7.7% and 19.3% of revenues for FY24 and FY23 respectively.   
  
FAME II subsidies have been scaled down from 40% to 15% in Jun '23 , following which there was temporary drop in sales which recovered by festive season. In future, introducing such subsidies may play a pivotal role in EV 2wheeler sales.  
  
Ola plans to import 2 key components in cell manufacturing ( CAM and AAM) from China, which might face problems due to geopolitical issues in future.  
  
**Ola electric has 4 e-scooter models which constituted 98% of revenues in FY24, which is definitely a concentration risk.**  
  
Ola Electric is relatively new having 3 years experience in market, so they might face some issues which are unsolvable. ( provided they don't have any technology partner to guide). Plus due to lack of historic data, they may face problem of inventory management wrt variants and colours. They are trying to develop in-house cell manufacturing capabilities which, if faces issues will cause loss of product reputation in market.  
  
37% of parts are imported from suppliers outside India. Top 10 suppliers supplied 60% of parts.   
  
Employee attrition rates of 44% is too abnormal, needs to be looked into with caution.  
  
Profitability of Ola depends on availing PLI incentive schemes from GOI.  
  
Capacity utilisation of Ola electric stands at 49% in FY24, which affects its profitability and hinders from achieving economies of scale.  
  
Ola has related party transactions to the tune of 25% of revenues, one must dig deeper into those before investing.  
  
Battery cost being 30% of vehicle cost, if battery life is poor then Ola scooters will earn bad reputation in market ( full cycle of battery is yet to be seen in most vehicles).  
  
  
**Valuation**  
  
Ola electric is valued at P/S of 6.69, whereas TVS at 3.11, Eicher at 7.87, Hero at 2.79, Bajaj at 5.82. PE ratio wise TVS  74, Bajaj 34, Eicher 32, Hero 28.",2024-08-02 16:59:47,18.0,23.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1eif8vm/ola_electric_ipo_analysis/,IndianStreetBets

post,1j4yqcw,Understanding the Commercial Vehicles and 3W market in India,GodofObertan,"Commercial Vehicles (CV’s) -

CV’s are broadly classified into Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV’s) and Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicles (MHCV’s).

LCVs include vans, pickup trucks, and small delivery trucks, while MHCVs include large tractor-trailers, dump trucks, and heavy-duty delivery trucks.

Broadly CV market is ~2,00,000 crores market with MHCV is ~1,30,000 crore market whereas LCV’s being ~70000 crores market.

Both MHCV and LCV are ~5% and ~3% lower than peak levels.



MHCV Market Share -

MHCV is a larger segment with 3 large players, Tata Motors (~47% MS), Ashok Leyland (~31%) )and Volvo-Eicher CV (~8.2%).

MHCV have smaller players in sub-segments such as SML Isuzu (buses), Mahindra, Olectra Greentech and JBM Auto (e-buses)

Tata Motors over past 10 years has lost ~800 bps primarily to Ashok Leyland and VECV (~600 and ~200 bps respectively)


LCV’s on the other hand has 2 large players i.e Mahindra (~43% MS) and Tata Motors (~34% MS), with Ashok Leyland and Force Motors being the smaller players. M&M has overtaken Tata Motors to be the largest LCV player in India.


E-CV’s -

ECV’s have the lowest penetration at 0.4%, the only sub-segment which has grown faster has been E-bus due to government bus and E-bus penetration has been higher than E-4 W.


How has the year been for CV’s in FY25 so far ?


CV has seen a de-growth of 1% for first 9M, and most companies expects similiar performance in Q4.

LCV’s has de-grown by 3% whereas MHCV’s have been flat.



Ashok Leyland - Benefits largely on account of strong MHCV Cycle

Tata CV - (will list on stock markets soon post demerger of Tata Motors) - Benefits from strong MHCV and LCV cycle.

Mahindra - Benefits largely on account of strong MHCV Cycle

VECV - Benefits largely on account of Strong MHCV cycle. VECV is ~15% for Eicher Motors.

JBM Auto and Olectra Greentech - Can benefit disproportionately if E-bus penetration increases materially and companies garner higher incremental market share

SML Isuzu - Bus portfolio doing well

Force Motors - Benefits largely on account of strong LCV cycle and particular categories such as ambulances.

Share

3 W -

3 wheeler Indian market is ~20000-22000 crore market with domestic 3 wheeler market being ~15000 crores and Export market is ~7500 crores.

3 wheelers are primarily goods and passenger rickshaws. Bajaj Auto is the largest player in India, followed by Piaggio and Mahindra. 3 wheeler volumes are 7% below it’s all time high volumes in 2020.


Bajaj Auto is the largest 3W player in the country followed by Piaggio and Mahindra. Other smaller players include Atul Auto and TVS domestic


EV -

3W has the highest EV penetration with ~15.6% on conventional 3W. If you include low voltage E-3W, (found in Delhi / Jaipur among other cities) EV penetration is already a ~56%


There are a lot E-3 W companies who have raised private capital (below list with last round valuation) and may get listed in the future

• Mahindra LMM - ~6600 crores

• Altigreen Propulsion system - ~2500 crores

• Euler Motors - ~1300 crores

•Atul Greentech – 983 crores

How has 3 W performed -

3W growth has been decent at 6% for first 9M.


Companies and exposure to 3W -

Atul Auto is the only pure-play 3 W listed player currently.

Bajaj Auto and TVS derives ~15% / 5% of revenues from 3W.



Conclusion - Broadly CV has seen de-growth in FY25 so far, No material outliers have been identified across segments in CV. Growth in CV’s is likely to be muted over the near future. Interest rate cut can materially aid CV cycle.

Broadly, there are 6 listed CV players which can disproportionately benefit depending on CV scenario.

 3W market evolution is a great primer for how auto-sector will evolve in electrification over the next few years and a lot of opportunities will develop and evolve in 3W space.

post,1imuhfm,Understanding 2 W Market in India,GodofObertan,"Let’s start with the basics -

OEM’s can be broadly classified into sub-segments i.e. -

2W – Scooters / Mopeds / Bikes

4W – Small (Hatchback and Sedans) and Large Cars (SUV’s and Van’s)

3W – Goods and Passengers Rickshaws

CV – Tempo’s, Trucks, Buses etc. (LCV / MHCV )

Agri-Equipment – Tractors, Tillers etc.

Construction Equipment – Cranes , Backhoe loaders, Excavators etc.

The first section will be focusing on 2 wheelers -

2 wheeler market -

Domestic 2 wheeler market is ~1.3-1.4 lakh market with an operating profit pool of around ~14000-15000 crores.

Top 4 players command over 80% domestic market share in 2 wheelers.

Post 2019 peak, volumes in 2024 are still 14% lower than peak, FY25 volumes may end up somewhere between 2018 and 2019 numbers, a shade below peak seen in 2019.


Industry mapping -

2 wheeler market can be broadly classified into 4 sub-segments -

<125 CC / 125-250 CC / >250 CC and Scooters

Segments which are going the fastest are >250 CC / Scooters / 125-250 CC whereas <125 CC has been de-growing due to price hikes because of regulatory norms and higher commodity prices.

Where are the companies placed ?

Hero Moto Corp garners more than 80% of domestic volumes from <125 CC bikes (Splendor and HF Deluxe) whereas 12% of volumes are from 125-250 CC

TVS garners 61% of domestic volumes from Scooters and Mopeds (Jupiter) and 27% of volumes from 125-250 CC

Bajaj Auto garners 67% of domestic volumes from 125-250 CC and 26% from <125CC

Eicher garners 100% of volumes from >250 CC

Honda (Unlisted) garners 56% of volumes from Scooters and 36% from 125-250 CC


Market share trends -

Key players in 2 wheelers by market share in FY 24 are

Hero MotoCorp - 29.3%

Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India - 24.5%

TVS - 17.1%

Bajaj Auto - 12.1%

Suzuki - 5%

Eicher Motors - 4.5%

Other players in 2W space are Yamaha, Ola, Ather, Greaves Mobility, WardWizard Innovation.


Over the past 5 years, Hero MotoCorp has lost market share with TVS being a key beneficiary of market share.

Key reason for market share loss for Hero MotoCorp can be attributed to struggling <125 CC segment while not having a meaningful pressure in growth segments in Scooters and 125-250 CC.

TVS increase in market share can be directly attributed to a much higher presence in growth segments Scooters and 125-250 CC

What are the Top Selling 2 wheelers in India ?


Exports -

Exports is another key driver driving ~20% of volumes for the Industry.

Exports market is ~32000 crores with Asia and Africa contributing ~81% of the volumes.

Nigeria is one of the largest countries for exports for Indian companies followed by Philippines, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Egypt and Nepal and Columbia.

Exports over the past few years have struggled due to currency challenges in Key geographies such as Nigeria, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Egypt, though is recovering sharply.


Bajaj Auto is the largest exporter of 2 wheelers in the country contributing ~50% of exports from the country.

Exports of 2 wheelers contribute ~35% / ~25% / ~9% / ~5% to Bajaj Auto / TVS / Eicher Motors and Hero Moto Corp


EV -

EV penetration as on FY24 stands at ~5.1% . As of FYTD25, penetration stands at 5.8%. EV growth has been ~30-35%.

99% of volumes are in EV scooters and EV penetration in scooters is ~16%.


EV is an evolving market, with material market share shifts every month. We use a 3M moving average to arrive at market share and it is a better reflection of prospective market share.

As of December. Ola is the largest E2W followed by TVS, Bajaj, Ather and Hero.


Honda’s Activa and Suzuki’s E-Access deliveries in the next few months will result in market share moderation for all the above peers.


How has FY25 been for 2 wheelers and where are they placed ?

2W have been the fastest growing sector in FY25 so far, seeing ~10.6% growth till December 2024. 2 wheelers are set for the second highest volumes delivered ever.


Suzuki and Honda has been the fastest growing domestic company growing over 29% / 23% YTD followed by TVS at 13.6%.

The scooter portfolio of the incumbents continues to materially outgrow the bikes portfolio.

Bajaj, Hero and Eicher volumes have been in the 6-8% growth rate.


There are pockets where each of the companies are placed which can benefit them, broad one liner for where each company is placed and what can help them grow faster.

Hero MotoCorp -

What’s happening - Hero has been continuously losing market share due to a weak EV and Scooter portfolio , 125-250CC and entry level 100 CC not doing well due to stress in rural economy.

When can Hero Outperform - If Rural recovery is sharp and faster than Urban recovery and if Hero(+Ather) continues to hold material market share in the EV segment.

TVS Motors -

What’s happening - TVS has been continuously garnering market share due to a strong Scooter and 125-250 CC portfolio.

When can TVS underperform - TVS Portfolio is at the highest risk of electrification (~61% of volumes in Scooters and Mopeds) resulting in probable material market share loss. EV market share is a key monitorable.

Bajaj Auto -

What’s happening -

Bajaj has been growing in-line with market owing to a decent 125-250 CC portfolio.

However, Bajaj Auto derives ~40% of exports from 2&3W and exports have been under pressure.

When can Bajaj Auto outperform -

Strong recovery in Africa and South Asia primarily Nigeria, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other countries.

Bajaj’s EV market share is rapidly increasing and if they are to maintain the same in long run

3W portfolio contributes ~15% of volumes, Strong 3W performance can help Bajaj Auto.

Eicher Motors -

What’s happening -

Eicher Motors has been losing market share as >250CC market has seen increased competitive intensity from Bajaj Triumph and Hero with Harley Davidson.

When can Eicher outperform -

Eicher’s ability to stay ahead of the curve in innovation and garnering market share in >250 CC and premium bikes

Exports growing materially faster (currently only 9% of volumes)

Ola - Ola’s success or failure will be determined by EV market share

Other listed players

Greaves Electric Mobility - Ampere

Rattan India Enterprises - Revolt

WardWizard Innovation - Joy E-bikes

Conclusion - Broadly 2W is the best performing sub-segment in FY25 so far and is expected to be the fastest growing segment in FY25.

post,1hfgpr3,Highlights of PPFAS unit holders meet 2024,Intrepid_Self4652,"We had a productive meeting with the [PPFAS Mutual Fund](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ppfas-mutual-fund/) team, which included [Rajeev Thakkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeev-thakkar-715b3b1b1/), [Raunak Onkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raunakonkar/), [Neil Parikh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-parikh-465b98187/), [Raj Mehta, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-mehta-cfa-8b8630a1/), [Rukun Tarachandani, CFA, CQF](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rukun-tarachandani-cfa-cqf-19765518/) & [Mansi Kariya, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansi-kariya-cfa/). Here are the highlights:  
  
Ø Achieving financial goals > beating benchmarks  
Ø Investment success is driven by asset allocation and compounding duration over individual stock/scheme selection  
Ø Midcap starts at 80k cr market cap and small-cap at 25k crore - no concerns regarding PPFAS Flexi Cap AUM  
Ø 4.5 lakh crores are invested in thematic/sectoral funds  
Ø No update from RBI on overseas investments. This question is asked to new governor now  
Ø Optimistic on India, but cautious due to high valuations. 80% invested but maintain 20% cash  
Ø Promoters are selling stakes (e.g., Whirlpool, Hyundai, LG, Walmart in Flipkart), while QIP activity and PE exits increase. Retail investors focus on SIPs, while promoters find value in QIPs  
Ø Okay to lose 50% of clients through redemptions than losing 50% of clients’ money by doing foolish things on investment side  
Ø Exposure to AI through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. Solar exposure is via transmission companies  
Ø Conservative Hybrid Funds cap equity at 25%. DAAF has a minimum of 35% equity. CHF taxation is as per slab rates, while DAAF offers LTCG benefits beyond 2 years. CHF can invest in REITs/InvITs; DAAF cannot  
Ø Rising investments in small-cap, mid-cap, thematic funds, AIFs, PMS, and smallcases explain their resilience in current market relative to large companies  
Ø BSE was a miss. Thought NSE would be a dominant player, but BSE made a remarkable comeback. Participated through CDSL.  
Ø Maruti (PF stock) – Only a pure four-wheeler play (others have commercial vehicle, investments in other subsidiary) – tracking M&M, Tata motors too. Maruti have missed on SUV, EV front but its fine – as technologies are still evolving  
Ø Sold UTI AMC & Bajaj Auto due to valuations. Question on capital markets – due to new IND AS, earnings volatility has increased a lot. Capital market business is inherently volatile and IND AS have made them more. Run up in stocks has gone up – so trimmed/sold  
Ø ITC – Not as attractive as it was when we bought. Still reasonable valued now. On ITC Hotels – demerged and asset-light  
Ø Overall investment returns are driven by three factors: Dividend yield, Earnings growth, P/E multiple (going up/steady/down)  
Ø Liquidity – to be looked from 2-3 factors in conjunction. First – how much of your investment strategy depends upon the churn (buy and hold ours). Second – Client concentration (less than 2% for our #1 client)  
Ø In India, perception has built up mid/small cap co.s will do well than large caps. In USA, its reverse. Not always true.  
Ø HDFC Bank being a biggie does not mean it’s at a disadvantage  
Ø Smaller AUM of PPFAS Tax saver does not give advantage to PPFAS Flexi. We follow the same approach. Just – no foreign stocks & arbitrage allowed. Tax saver – min. 80% invested all time. Flexi – 65%.

Ø PPFAS DAAF maintains a fixed income duration of 3.25–3.5 years  
Ø On government regulation – you cannot avoid this is probably any sector (pvt or public)  
Ø Exited Accelya Kale due to concerns over its parent’s product roadmap  
Ø Missed Nvidia. Fundamental assumption was wrong in this case.  
Ø Succession plan – we have alignment of interests. Financially: ESOPs, investments in PPFAS units, on the same page on strategy, organization moving forward. Built a relationship that has passed professional things.  
Ø Exploring a new asset class (10L min.) under evolving guidelines  
Ø No plans for the AMC IPO for next couple of years  
Ø On ESG: Governance – we consider this even before ESG was a thing. E & S part – neutral. Business is not black & white.  
Ø Real estate is difficult for conviction-led investing, but proxies look attractive. Book – Inside Real Estate by Sushil Sayal. Surprised if we buy any RE developer in next 3-6 months.  
Ø We do track momentum, factor based (volatility of business etc.). Models are built to identify long term trends  
Ø Hiring a financial advisor is one of the best investments.  
Ø A mistake is not where a stock price went down, or its good thing if it went up. These are an outcome. Process > Outcome.

Ø Not considering investment in China

post,1dy0p91,Realtime Stock News Tracker,HistoricalAd4543,"Hi, I was looking for a tool which can track all news related to stocks in realtime from various sources at one place. I could not find any such tool. Used moneycontrol portal and forum for tracking various news and chatter related to a particular stock but it has become super annoying due to ADs every 10-15 sec. So, I have built a simple tracker.

What it does is:

* It tracks several sources like, ET, BS, News Portals etc.
* Stock wise news notifications / section
* Can be used as a forum for discussion about a particular stock

Currently, it solves my purpose of accessing all news related to a stock at one place. But, I want to develop it further and add more sources / information. Can also add stock specific information like various technical indicators, chart patterns, bulk deal etc.

It would be great if few of you guys can use it and let me know if it is useful and what improvements can be made in it. You can access it inside telegram by searching ""Dalal Street Tracker""

How are you scraping the news?

Using RSS feeds might give you some performance improvement without the need to parse website specific pages.



Doing very basic sentiment analysis on the news headline/body can give an indication if the news is positive or negative",2024-07-08 05:47:00,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1dy0p91/realtime_stock_news_tracker/,IndianStreetBets

I am using RSS Feeds wherever available.

Using Telegram because of its simple APIs and wider reach. We can plug other apps like Discord, Email or even push them to a portal. But, for now, using telegram because it is super easy.

Yes. Sentiment analysis can be added but first I need to see if tool is useful for others as well. For me personally, it solves my purpose of getting stock wise news update in real time. I have few (15-20) stocks which I have invested in and so I want to get regular updates about them. Dont want to miss anything about these stocks.

post,1hken96,$SVMH ,cromesleeve,"SVMH i think imma hold 2025 after i trade and re add dip. Honestly extremely undervalued. India has the largest population and highest demand for 2 wheelers. Prana 2.0 specs are literally un matched. i think it can capitalize off the “premium” feel. Considering what its competitors are worth! They already have two dealerships, just one news away from a major rebound. also one of the few manufacturers that use LPF batteries which are drastically better.",2024-12-23 03:05:21,12.0,6.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1hken96/svmh/,StockMarket
comment,1hken96,,,,,,,m4lr70h,Significant-Fruit455,"I'm seeing it as a long hold. I'm quite content for it to slowly move upward from here. Today was a good day for SVMH, but I feel it's just the run up before people dump it prior to year's end to write-off the loss on their taxes. If it can rebound quickly from any drop at the start of the new year, then it should have legs to carry to $.10 - $.25 by the summer.",2024-12-30 23:19:29,1.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1hken96/svmh/,StockMarket

comment,1hken96,,,,,,,m4ls3gk,Significant-Fruit455,"I'm hoping the earnings report in February will reflect a slowing of losses and that the Prana is selling, and selling well. You are correct about India and the vastness of that market. As long as the product is high quality, and the deliveries go without any issues, we should start to see this stock trend upward. 

The *only* issue I see is that two-wheel vehicles are less expensive, thus create less revenue than a traditional car, and at what point does an emerging Indian economy and consumer market begin to prefer family-size vehicles?",2024-12-30 23:24:38,1.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1hken96/svmh/,StockMarket

comment,1hken96,,,,,,,m4nv9vt,CommunityNumerous377,I lived in India for a short while. They absolutely love scooters. Maneuverability in over congested traffic and narrow emporiums are why these vehicles are a must. I seen entire families piled on to 150 cc Honda. Cars will never fill this space in the market,2024-12-31 07:53:37,1.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1hken96/svmh/,StockMarket
