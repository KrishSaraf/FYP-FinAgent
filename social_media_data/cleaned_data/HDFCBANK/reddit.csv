We have a lot of room left for improvements, overhauling in the banking, roads, infrastructure, consumerism so it'll always be the fastest growing sectors.

post,1kwmb12,"Built a risk control tool for Zerodha — It’s not turned me profitable, but it’s helping me avoid big mistakes",Duxbury_utopia,"I’ve been trading options on Zerodha for a while. Like a lot of people, I’ve struggled with sticking to risk limits — things like revenge trading, oversized positions, and re-entering bad trades hoping for a turnaround. 

To deal with that, I built a small risk management tool with two friends. I am using this only for option buying. It’s not a strategy or signal tool — just something to keep my behavior in check. 

It connects to Zerodha using their API and lets you:

* Exit a position if the PnL hits a loss limit
* Block re-entry after a profitable or losing trade
* Set a cooldown timer between trades
* Limit max exposure per position or trade

Here’s a screenshot of the risk panel I’ve been using:

It hasn’t made me profitable (yet), but it’s helped me avoid the kind of decisions that usually blow up my day. I’ve started taking more deliberate entries and managing position size better. I’m still building it out based on how I trade. Thought it might be helpful to share.

Right now it connects to Zerodha through the API. You enter your API keys and generate a session token each morning — after that, it watches your positions and applies the risk limits you’ve set.

Only Companies which are in Monopoly Business would be in better shape in upcoming Year.

Government would focus more on Overall Economy rather than focusing on Corporate/ Companies.

Step 4. if his Numbers matches with the 800 dividend. Then ask him to send a mail from his official email id mentioning the MF name and list of last 4-5 dividend given by that MF with dates.

post,1gtiern,Portfolio review please,dreamer0910,"Background: Till about 1 year ago, I would have referred to myself as a super-diversified hardcore value conscious defensive investor. Still would call myself that but have taken positions in some not-large-cap companies in the last 1 year.

I have 75 stocks in my portfolio but have include 42 in the screenshot below with a sizeable position > 75k

Rationale for the top holdings

1. HDFC Bank: Biggest private sector bank with a focus on retail and growing in Tier-2/3 cities. We are 1 stock market crash away from HDFC Bank rallying. Irony?
2. Angel One: Growing the second fastest in brokers. Fairly valued as compared to Groww but overvalued as compare to Zerodha.

3. INFY/HCL/Wipro: Most of my positions are more than 2 years old. Now, you can call it Betting on Trump
4. IRFC: Got lucky. Bought at a decent valuation when the stock was 25. Sold 1/3 position at 125 and still hold the remaining 2/3 of the position. Will let it play out because if India needs to move at scale, railways need to be better and more common. Railways get their funding from IRFC.
5. Amara Raja: Betting on a reputed battery company with the most reliable battery brand (Amron). Bought it at decent valuations around 2 years back
6. Divis/Dr. Reddy/NH/Lal Pathlabs: Consumer companies in an economy where focus on healthcare is expected to grow

post,1kwol0z,HDFC Imperia account got lower brokerage on InvestRight without paying extra,myinnos,"I’ve been holding an InvestRight Demat account since 2020, and my current brokerage charges are 0.5%. My HDFC savings account variant is *Imperia*.

I recently found out that customers who open a Demat account under the *Imperia* variant get just 0.1% brokerage charges.

However, to avail this now, I’m being told I need to pay ₹10,000 + GST.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Is there any way to get this reduced brokerage without paying the full amount again?

34YO Male. Professional Income. 

Started post-Covid. But a substantial sum out of this has been invested in the last 3-4 months.

Point is to review the portfolio / allocation etc. as it stands today - for the future. That is why I have provided current value of holdings (though invested sum can be calculated pretty easily). Past gains (especially %ages) are indicative of pretty much nothing as I have been irregular in buying and accumulating over the said period.

Would love everyone's views and opinions. 

PS - discerning folks on here will be able to see Saurabh Mukherjea's influence but even more discerning (and sympathethic) folks will be able to see I am reducing the said influence now 😄

LATE (AND LONG) EDIT - As rightly said in some replies, MF portfolio has some unnecessary over-complication. I'm slowly moving my inv from Axis ELSS to PP ELSS (as and when 3 year limit ends), so count one less fund. The two PP funds again I count as basically one big Flexi fund, so that's again one less fund. Small caps I don't feel comfortable with just one fund, and the universe is large enough to accommodate two funds. 
So basically-
•one Largecap (Niftybees) 
•one Flexicap (2 PPs + whatever's left of Axis)
•one Large & Mid
•one Midcap
•two Smallcaps
•one USA (where in fact if someone can suggest which should I actually invest in, anyway PP Flexi can't invest more in the US stocks).

Been in market for a year now and lately adding more funds.

no complaints with the results till now, with returns around 20%. But Ig there is lot more I can improve. not looking to sell anything anytime soon,

Reasoning behind these picks

Brought hdfc during dip ntg much to it.

NCC is cus m very bullish on Roads, National Highways, bridges and other infra as govt is focusing on this sector more than before.

HCLTech was my first big bet, ik tcs was a great option as well but I believe opportunity in hcl is much better. A year ago Infosys Wipro were not in my probables. now I see Infosys doing fine but I would still like to stick to HCLTech.

Tata Steel is my alltime favorite, I see it at 400+ range is 5 years or soo.

I'm debating between ambuja and ultratech cement now sure of wt to choose as well.

would like to know your views. any suggestions are welcomed.😇",2024-08-31 19:26:39,21.0,23.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1f5vbsm/completed_a_year_in_market_suggestions_are/,IndianStockMarket

comment,1f5vbsm,,,,,,,ll00sw1,None,"Hi man, good you have invested and made returns too. Here are some suggestions from my side, don't be disheartened or offended. I am giving these in your best interest only and since I've gone through this phase i can probably give more sensible advice  
1- Ncc- it's a okay share. ROE on lower side, but main thing is what theme are you betting on. You mentioned you are bullish on infra. From past experiences it is seen that during bull markets infra, real estate shares make highs and do well but during bear markets everyone forget such shares. This theme has never fascinated my personally, and I do not fall for this theory that ""India ko develop hona hai toh infra toh badhega hi"" that is a hollow statement and many imp stats are ignored while saying this. Still if you have studied the theme enough and bullish on it then keep up with it. Other financial ratios seem to be fine in this share.   
2- HCLTech - Large cap IT. In IT space I can divide it like two categories. Extremely large cap big companies and some emerging small cap or mid cap IT space. Personally if I am coming to markets i want to make more than usual returns. Large cap ITs have grown significantly and I do not see them growing 16-18 percent, although i would want more than 20% growth returns. So I always look for mid cap ITs not even small cap because that makes it more risky. So general suggestion, until unless you are too hinged on hcltech you can look for mid cap, see where their operations are what are their services? do this before rate cuts starts because that will give boost to the company's financials in the coming quarters. 

3- Tata steel - You might not like my opinion but reaching 400 in five years is not a big achievement (& is not even guaranteed). Thing is it is highly cyclical stock. Even tata steel mgmt doesn't know what steel prices they would be addressing in next quarter because a lot of volatility is there in such sectors due to geopolitical reasons and much more. Tata mgmt is amazing but business essentially is not good and once the downtrend starts then you will be stuck at one price for long and even the mgmt can't do much if external forces are not in their favor. So in long run you are minimizing your returns if you keep ur money in this stock. All my answers are in assumption of you should be making at least 18-20% returns every year (not just one year)

4-Ambuja Cement- why are you so hinged on infra and building materials? If you see you are keeping such low ROE businesses that automatically will reduce your returns. ROE is an important ratio, ideally it should be above 18% and if cash light business is there like IT then above 25%   


5- Bought the best banking stock. You got it at right levels so cant say much. Not a bad investment and can make good returns 

  
6-  Sula - Ideally not a good sector to invest, and even if you are then you should keep sectoral leaders. These sectors are not something which will observe huge demands all of sudden, understand this. Buying small cap shares makes sense when the sector is in huge demand. UB was much better choice. And if you asked me I would say you should invest in proper consumption stock rather than this. 

7- IRFC - another low ROE business. Seems like you got it by hearing its name in news or x. I mean you can invest but again from long term if you are here to make good returns then focus should be on right sectors, high roe business. 

8- Goldbees - I do not invest in bees personally and I have a neutral view on it. 

Overall your returns are less not just from one year view but I can see your future pf trajectory. I know you are not open to make changes but you should make changes at this level to improve your pf for the future.

General advice

1- Do not be in love with any share/company. We do have our favourites where we think we are gonna make money, company is good. But we cannot be fixated. We are here to make money and not keep the loving company even if we are losing money. 

2- Always be in search for better ideas/themes. I think your pf is more towards low roe business, more infra related and if infra theme fails then this pf will give less returns. Try to think of other themes. I urge you to research on consumption stocks because in long run consumption shares can give 20-25% returns. Technology shares and financial shares can do the same.

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1huyc3v,Market Meltdown: Fear of #HMPV Virus and #FII Selling Drag Down Indian Markets 📉,Familiar-Presence327,"The Indian equity markets took another hit on **January 6, 2025**, with the **Nifty 50** plunging **1.6%** (over 400 points) to **23,601.50**, and the **BSE Sensex** plummeting **1.6%** (over 1,200 points) to **77,959.95**.

#### What's Behind the Sell-Off?
- **#HMPV Virus Scare**: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) detected two cases of the **Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV)** in Karnataka. This has spooked investors, adding to the market's woes.
- **Continued #FII Selling**: Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have sold over **₹4,500 crore** in January, with concerns over current valuations making Indian markets less attractive.
- **#HDFCBank's Slow Loan Growth**: HDFC Bank reported a **15.8% year-on-year growth in deposits**, but only a **3% growth in loans**, causing its stock to fall by **2.2%** to **₹1,710.60**.

#### Expert Opinions
- **Deepak Jasani** from HDFC Securities highlighted that the **#FII selling** is a bigger concern than the HMPV cases.
- **V K Vijayakumar** from Geojit Financial Services mentioned that **urban demand** is not as weak as feared, and resilient domestic segments might support the market.
- **Prashanth Tapse** from Mehta Equities pointed out that **earnings updates** and **Trump's dialogue** post his January 20 inauguration will be key market drivers.

#### Looking Ahead
The market's direction will depend on upcoming **#Q3Earnings** and **Trump's policy decisions**. Investors are advised to stay cautious and watch for any positive cues from earnings updates and global developments.

post,1e7b8gb,Portfolio query Is PMS a viable option?,greatergood07,"Hello everyone, I currently have a self made folio of about 23L (entered market in Mar 21) with a 50% Large,30% mid & 20% small allocation and 80% value from 18 stocks. I am 41 and doent have any liabilities, house is paid for, not interested in owning a car right now (If I will, I'll buy with cash) to add to this I have a year of expenses saved asside as emergency funds plus a PPF account which matures next year.

I am also fortunate to inherit my parents folio which is currently at 1.8c with 82% of it coming from 12 stocks and it has a total of 65 stocks which were bought almost a decade back and has not been managed since. It just compounded over time. Note: Dad retired from L&T thus 33% which I need to trim. This along with my folio is for my retirement and plan to keep it long term 15+ yrs

https://preview.redd.it/mg3jz8r3uidd1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=cca951302023d0a072154bc82731ce0a95ec7e05

Now I am considering if I should go with a PMS (some options are Liquide black/Kedia securities. I am also checking for one of my aqquitances who manages PMS and is a ex Axis bank employee used to manage HNIs

Talk about Liquide they charge currently have a flat structure of 30k annually and provides a 360 approach to investing including tax planning. They will have around 10 custom stocks and plan to deploy funds over 2 weeks in the market. I was a bit concerned about it but they said they are taking money from equity and reinvesting into other stocks so not really a risk persay. Also folio will be managed by me 100% they just act as advisory.

Over the years I feel it is better to have specialists working (like a team of yours) that makes life easier. I'll be happy if I can get a 17%-18% CAGR and peaceful sleep

Your thoughts please.. I'm sharing snapshot of my folio (from Zerodha) and parents folio (excel) so you have a fair idea on how I have performed (everyone has performed in the bull market 😁)

Your recommendations are really appreciated, Thank You :)",2024-07-19 18:47:53,3.0,14.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1e7b8gb/portfolio_query_is_pms_a_viable_option/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1e7b8gb,,,,,,,ldz6h85,None,"One simple thing. You can't hold stocks for long on someone's suggestions, you will start to doubt yourself and advisory in a bear market. Understand the market, pick undervalued, growing, quality stocks, invest and forget. Your stock picking skills are good IMO. Just hold for long. No advisory will come in help if COVID or 2008 crash repeats, you are most likely to sell those in panic and due to lack of understanding the business. ☺️ I'm not much qualified to advice, still I have heard these from my father. He was approached by a PMS manager, but luckily he got away from it. Now he holds many 10-20-30-40+ baggers. I'm more focused towards studying and picking growing smallcaps in value zone. Anyways PMS won't help in any market. Check historic returns of popular PMFs. Compare it with an index fund. You will yourself beat them if you have conviction on business and hold.

1. **Professional Expertise**: PMS ensures active monitoring and management by experts with a dedicated research team.
2. **Better Returns**: With the right firm, you can expect consistent returns, often exceeding 15% CAGR over the long term (5+ years).
3. **Peace of Mind**: Delegating your portfolio management reduces stress and lets you focus on other priorities.

**My Recommendations**:  
Avoid smaller players like Liquide. Instead, consider reputed firms like **360One** and **Alchemy Capital**. Both have a proven track record and are trusted by many HNIs, including several of my own clients who are extremely happy with the performance and stability of their PMS investments.

post,1fi2695,Confusion regarding divesting direct equities into a Nifty 50 Index !? ,bharti18,"Need some advice fam !!

Had invested in these 6 stocks in Jan 2021, should I continue to hold them as they have only yielded 8.5% average annually in last 3.5 years, if you see until now, which is much lower than the average return of a nifty 50 index also…which has been about 14% annually in last 3 years..

I am confused if I should sell of these and take a 12.5% LTCG tax  hit which will bring my average return to 7% something and then start from scratch with this 6 Lac about remains capital by starting a Nifty 50 or should I hold them forget about them for the long term of let say 10/15 years, which I can do actually. LTCG is coming around 18,000 INR as of now.

Just think that this is a lesson learnt and start from scratch. Don’t worry about taxes now tbh since your capital is safe.

post,1dvymx1,Realtime Stock News Tracker : Beta Testing & Suggestions,HistoricalAd4543,"Hi, I was looking for a tool which can track all news related to stocks in realtime from various sources at one place. I could not find any such tool. Used moneycontrol portal and forum for tracking various news and chatter related to a particular stock but it has become super annoying due to ADs every 10-15 sec. So, I have built a simple tracker. What it does is:

* It tracks several sources like, ET, BS, News Portals etc.
* Stock wise news notifications / section
* Can be used as a forum for discussion about a particular stock

Currently, it solves my purpose of accessing all news related to a stock at one place. But, I want to develop it further and add more sources / information. Can also add stock specific information like various technical indicators, chart patterns, bulk deal etc.

It would be great if few of you guys can use it and let me know if it is useful and what improvements can be made in it.

post,1e04kst,Relatively safer bull strategy,Miserable-Ostrich685,"The current valuations makes me uncomfortable, but markets have their own minds, and there are lots of positive triggers ahead (consumer friendly budget, rate cuts, FIIs money etc), so I don't want to miss out the rally by sitting on sidelines.

How about moving the capital to  couple of large caps stocks, which are relatively cheaper (eg. HDFCBANK, ITC)?

Thesis - These are stable businesses run by professionals, already beaten down due to slower growth, if bulls continue, these stocks might get a re-rating and in case bears take over, with the current valuations there is a limited downside.

Additionally, sell 10-20% of holdings as OTM calls based on monthly outlook, if stock falls, you earn premiums, if it rises, you earn limited profit. Use that money in building position on cheaper stocks.

I usually wait for my stocks to hit a certain price before I take out the principal amount and the profit remains invested in the stock itself. I try to choose stocks with good fundamentals and have not consistently invested in a stock because I may not have the patience for it right now and also my capital is limited. I know no. of stocks are greater compared to the capital invested but some of my bets take more time to give returns and some are impulse decisions that I intend to cut down.

Now, I have some doubts regarding my portfolio:

1. **Is my MF portfolio good?**

I started with 5 SIPs based on my research but kept adding more whenever I found something interesting. Recently, friends advised that having too many MF SIPs can be problematic. They mentioned that the investment amount shouldn't change, but the number of MFs should be fewer. I didn't fully understand this. Are they right? If so, why? Also, if I need to reduce the number of MFs, which SIPs should I keep and which should I let go?

2. **Should I invest less in SIPs and more in stocks?**

I'm 29, and my friends say my risk appetite is higher. However, I prefer long-term investments and don't have the time or expertise to buy/sell stocks regularly. Am I making a mistake by focusing more on SIPs? Should I allocate more to stocks?

3. **Should I consider an SWP?**

4. I have 10 lacs to invest now. Any suggestions on how to allocate this based on my current portfolio?

Sorry for the many questions, but I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!",2024-06-27 05:22:34,3.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1dpjl0b/seeking_advice_on_my_investment_portfolio/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1dpjl0b,,,,,,,lahef35,Individual_Zombie_85,"1. Yeah I think you have way too many MF's. You can reduce it to 4-5 funds max. Please check the overlap between the different funds. I don't think multiple ELSS Tax Saver funds are required. Just keep 1 from each category. The reason for not keeping multiple MF's is, different expense ratios can keep eating into your profits.
2. If you don't have time to analyse and buy/sell stocks, you can continue with your SIP, no problem in that. You mentioned that you are picking stocks based on your friend's suggestions, and that can go horribly wrong. It's your life and your financial goals, so you can take the call about which way you want to go.

Looking at your portfolio, you seem to be newbee investor. Wait a while. Looking at the news last couple of days and the exit polls, it may even drop by 25%. But worry not, It will go up by end of next month and you can keep holding till the stocks give you +10% at least.

If the companies are doing fine and it's just the market sentiment playing around with you holdings, you can just let it stay till you start seeing profit (even if it takes you a year or plus)",2024-11-21 05:19:39,4.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1gw7rs9/time_to_hit_the_reset_button_should_i_exit_my/,StockMarketIndia

I have heavily invested in Niftybees, ITBees, BankBees and Pharmabees. Today when I was checking the analytics section in my stock broker (Zerodha), all these ETF's are categorized as ""Debt"". Should I be worried about it?

I know individual stocks like HDFCBank, INFY, TCS etc... are all taxed at 12.5% (LTCG). Is the same applies for NiftyBees, ITBees and Pharmabees as well?

Also, why does NSE official website show Niftybees, Bankbees under Debt category? [https://www.nseindia.com/products-services/etfs-debt](https://www.nseindia.com/products-services/etfs-debt)

Also as per my father's advice, as he used to do is save a target sum for a year and invest in mutual funds lump sum when the market plummets. Do this once or twice in a year rather than SIP.

comment,1e63j6j,,,,,,,ldtp910,dbzbs992,"If your father's friend is not regularly advising you, suggest you to switch to direct plan. Also, I would suggest not get into sectors like PSUs and defence based on momentum. Certain sectors will make lot of move then crash then settle down in certain levels for a long time.

If your purpose with defence fund investment is to capture momentum in certain pockets of the market, I would suggest to go for factor based indices, my personal suggestions would be Nifty200 momentum 30 and nifty 500 value 50, combination of these two factors would yield you good returns over long term, as when one factor doesn't shine, the other does. You can also swap out momentum 30 with Nifty midcap 150 momentum 50 if you bear little more volatility.

If you want to capture momentum in sectors via aggressive sector rotation there is Edelweiss business cycle fund which aggressively changes sector allocation based on factors like momentum, value etc.

Also, my advice would be that instead of allocating small percent allocation to sectoral or thematics, you could give large allocation to these factors indices.


Other than, your portfolio is better than 95% of the stuff I see on here.

comment,1ev8fhk,,,,,,,lipusqs,parabola9999,"I assumed, sorry if it ticked you off the wrong way. The statement was meant in jest, clearly our senses of humor differ considerably. 

1. Again, not a Covid investor myself, but the assumption that risks are necessary for market-beating rewards is not a sane theory. You can, and should, aim to beat the markets at your ideal risk appetite, and then compare the risk-reward against your beta when benchmarking. This is, in essence, the efficient market hypothesis.

2. Red and green hota rehta hai. Good that you're enjoying tropical paradise abhi, and congrats on the same. But Bees is just a basket of stocks, and nothing more than that. It's not inherently bad, it's like trading on an index-linked ETF when you don't have a clear picture about the constituents, but like the theme. Sure, individual components within a basket of stocks will definitely overperform the average, but it also protects you from underperformance.

post,1fre4dr,Where do we go now?,aman2992,"Portfolio update: Invested barely 60k over last 5 months vs an average investment run rate of 40k per month over last ~7 years. Portfolio value grew by almost 10L nonetheless. Basis experience so far in the markets, can't find value anywhere currently. Holding 2.5L in cash for any correction.

Right move at this point seems to diversify away from equities. However, overall debt portfolio also is sizeable and it doesn't seem wise to add to it considering taxes and inflation. Hence have zeroed down on land or real estate as the next investment vehicle. However, ticket size is huge, which is why I feel I am caught in a long waiting game.

Medium term strategy for equities is to keep building the cash position waiting for prices to cool down (US elections, interest rate move maybe) and to build a safety shell around equity portfolio so that it needn't be touched and can keep growing at whatever rate.

post,1im0vye,Strengthening the Indian Rupee: Leveraging Idle Gold through Enhanced Banking Schemes,supereminent_,"India's cultural affinity for gold has led to an estimated 25,000 tonnes of the precious metal being held by households and temples, often lying idle in lockers and vaults.

[tianjindaxuexuebao.com](https://tianjindaxuexuebao.com/dashboard/uploads/8.%204V2ZJ.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)This vast reserve, if effectively mobilized, presents a significant opportunity to bolster our economy and strengthen the Indian Rupee (INR).



**The Economic Impact of Idle Gold:**

* **Current Account Deficit (CAD):** India is one of the world's largest importers of gold. This high volume of imports contributes substantially to the CAD, exerting pressure on the INR.[tianjindaxuexuebao.com](https://tianjindaxuexuebao.com/dashboard/uploads/8.%204V2ZJ.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Currency Depreciation:** A higher CAD often leads to the depreciation of the INR against major currencies, affecting the country's purchasing power and economic stability.[policybazaar.com](https://www.policybazaar.com/gold-rate/articles/how-gold-affects-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Proposed Solution: Gold Monetization and Specialized Loan Schemes**

To mitigate these challenges, we should encourage the infusion of idle gold into the economy. The government and financial institutions can play a pivotal role by:

1. **Enhancing Gold Monetization Schemes (GMS):** The GMS, introduced in 2015, aims to mobilize idle gold by allowing individuals and institutions to deposit gold with banks in exchange for interest earnings. However, its uptake has been limited due to various factors, including lack of awareness and concerns about the safety and returns.[tianjindaxuexuebao.com](https://tianjindaxuexuebao.com/dashboard/uploads/8.%204V2ZJ.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
2. **Introducing Specialized Gold-Backed Loan Products:** Banks can develop loan products that offer favorable terms to individuals and businesses willing to pledge their gold holdings. This approach can:
   * **Provide Liquidity:** Enable gold holders to access funds without selling their assets.
   * **Reduce Gold Imports:** Satisfy domestic demand through recycled gold, thereby decreasing the need for imports.
   * **Strengthen the INR:** Lower gold imports can help reduce the CAD, contributing to a stronger INR.

**Current Banking Initiatives:**

Several banks have initiated gold loan schemes to provide liquidity against gold assets. For instance:

* **ICICI Bank:** Offers gold loans with interest rates starting from 9.25%, allowing loans up to ₹2 crore with flexible repayment options.[icicibank.com](https://www.icicibank.com/personal-banking/loans/gold-loan?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **State Bank of India (SBI):** Provides personal gold loans with interest rates starting from 8.50% per annum, catering to various financial needs.[sbi.co.in](https://www.sbi.co.in/web/personal-banking/loans/gold-loan?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **HDFC Bank:** Offers quick disbursal of gold loans with competitive interest rates and flexible tenure options.[hdfcbank.com](https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/borrow/loan-against-assets/gold-loan?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Conclusion:**

By effectively mobilizing idle gold through enhanced monetization schemes and specialized loan products, we can reduce our dependence on gold imports, lower the CAD, and work towards strengthening the INR. It's imperative for policymakers, financial institutions, and citizens to collaborate in this endeavor to harness the economic potential of our gold reserves.

What do you think in the future it will be valued at, even if hypothetically it becomes twice in valuation the share price earning potential is much lower.
Rather choose banks like Federal and IDFC First Bank which has good earnings with lower valuations and room to reach the valuation of HDFC in the future.
If I were at your place I would go with stocks that would proxy play or directly related to manufacturing, infrastructure, and green energy with some defense PSU.

comment,1fly8as,,,,,,,lo6tufy,Curious_Soul_2022,"ADANI POWER / TATA POWER - keep one of it.



ASTRAL - Pipe business good for long term, may keep



BAJAJAHFL - as you got it at IPO price you can keep it for long term, but there are better NBFC stocks, if you wish to take entries in them.



BORORENEW - no idea



DHAMPURSUG - sugar is cyclical sector , depends on government incentives and commodity consumption



EMUDHRA - may keep, for its unique service / niche



HDFC - best in private banking sector can keep it for long term, average on dips



JIOFIN - As of now, no operations are seen in real world, time will tell its prospects, observer for an year and decide, it will be in bull run soon and gives you good profits reaching ATH



POONAWALLA - No analysis, no comments, but seems to be good as heard from others.



RELIANCE - keep averaging, can hold for long term bluechip stock.



SBI - largest PSU bank, can hold for long, average on dips



SENCO - gold sector (may be you can buy GOLDBEES instead of this, which only tracks gold rate, instead of companies profits and losses).



SONACOMS - No analysis, no comments.



TATAMOTORS - PV segment and automobile - good, keep averaging although your entry price is already good, this stock may go up like bajaj auto or heromotocorp someday in future, so keep adding volume, also apply for TATA EV IPO and keep adding volume to it.



TITAN - keep this or SENCO, both belong to same sector. May be keep TITAN and replace SENCO with GOLDBEES.



UNOMINDA - Auto Ancillary (may be keep) or add some Oil Sector Stock to diversify your portfolio, as i don;t find oil stocks in your current portfolio (except reliance which is diversified into many sectors). / Add IT Stock like TCS.



VBL - Good in consumer sector.
