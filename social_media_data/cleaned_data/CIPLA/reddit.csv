post,1hg14zq,Can CIPLA be a hedge against rupee depreciation ?,esteppan89,"CIPLA is a pharma company that has been listed for a while. The international revenue has been steadily rising, both in absolute value and as a percentage of total revenue. It was 24% for Q4-2019, the last quarter it is at 38%. With a 1.4% depreciation in rupee this quarter, this will increase again.

I checked the profit from operating activities and found that the conversion of profits into cash from operations is also high. Am i missing something in this stock ?

post,1fy9fhd,"I asked ChatGPT to act as a financial advisor and list me the stocks of the company whose products/services will always be in demand irrespective of war, lower income, and GDP fall, this is what it analyzed. Fascinating conversation ahead!!!  The most funny part is in the end.",dare-to-live,"**ChatGPT:**

There are certain goods and services that people will always need, regardless of economic conditions, crises, or even wars. These essentials are typically linked to survival, basic needs, and essential services. Here’s a breakdown of the types of products and services people will always buy:

# 1. Food and Water

* **Staples**: Basic food items like rice, bread, grains, and canned goods are always in demand.
* **Water**: Clean drinking water or water purification products remain essential.

# 2. Healthcare and Medicine

* **Prescription Drugs**: People with chronic conditions or illnesses require medications regardless of circumstances.
* **Over-the-Counter Medicine**: Pain relievers, cold and flu medicine, and first-aid supplies will always be needed.
* **Medical Services**: Hospitals, clinics, and emergency medical services remain essential.

# 3. Hygiene Products

* **Toiletries**: Soap, shampoo, toothpaste, and sanitary products are necessary for basic hygiene.
* **Cleaning Supplies**: Disinfectants, laundry detergent, and household cleaners are always in demand for maintaining sanitation.

# 4. Shelter and Utilities

* **Housing**: Whether through rent or ownership, people will always need shelter.
* **Utilities**: Water, electricity, and gas are essential to operate homes and keep them livable.

# 5. Basic Clothing

* People need clothing, especially functional items like winter jackets, shoes, and workwear.

# 6. Communication and Connectivity

* **Internet and Phone Services**: In the modern world, communication is vital for both personal and business survival. Even in crises, people need to stay connected.
* **Basic Electronics**: Devices like phones and computers will remain essential for communication, work, and accessing information.

# 7. Transportation

* **Fuel**: Gasoline, diesel, or alternatives like electricity for vehicles.
* **Basic Vehicle Maintenance**: In areas where public transport is scarce or unavailable, people will maintain their cars.

# 8. Security

* **Home Security**: Systems that provide safety and security will always have demand.
* **Personal Safety**: In some areas or during times of conflict, items like protective gear, firearms, or security services may become essential.

# 9. Education

* **Basic Learning Tools**: Even in tough times, education is a priority for many, leading to the ongoing purchase of school supplies, textbooks, and online learning resources.

# 10. Debt Servicing

* People are generally required to continue making payments on debts like mortgages, loans, and credit cards even during economic downturns or crises.

These goods and services represent core needs, making them ""recession-proof"" or ""war-proof"" industries in most circumstances.

**Me: Okay, based on this. What are the Indian stocks that a person should buy?**

**ChatGPT:**

* **Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUL)** - FMCG (consumer products).
* **Nestlé India** - Food and beverages (ethical and compliant products).
* **Tata Consumer Products** - Food and beverage sector.
* **Cipla** - Pharmaceutical company.
* **Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories** - Pharmaceutical company.
* **Sun Pharmaceuticals** - Pharmaceutical company.
* **Apollo Hospitals** - Healthcare provider.
* **NTPC Ltd.** - Power generation (utilities).
* **Tata Power** - Renewable and conventional energy provider.
* **GAIL India Ltd.** - Natural gas processing and distribution.
* **Godrej Consumer Products** - FMCG (consumer and personal care products).

**Me:** Okay, if I had 1,00,000 rs of capital and my goal is for 5 years, which stock should I invest in and in what ratio? Do your analysis as a financial advisor and tell me the answer

**ChatGPT:**

* **Cipla**: ₹20,000 (20%)
* **Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories**: ₹10,000 (10%)
* **Sun Pharmaceuticals**: ₹10,000 (10%)
* **NTPC**: ₹15,000 (15%)
* **Tata Power**: ₹15,000 (15%)
* **Hindustan Unilever**: ₹15,000 (15%)
* **Tata Consumer Products**: ₹10,000 (10%)
* **Nestlé India**: ₹5,000 (5%)

**Me:** Okay, suppose I invest a 1,00,000 lump sum today, and for 5 years I invest 10,000 rs monthly for every month, then what will be my investment, and what will be my portfolio value after 5 years?

**ChatGPT:**

If you invest ₹1,00,000 as a lump sum today and continue investing ₹10,000 monthly for the next 5 years, here's the projection:

* **Total Investment**: ₹7,00,000 (₹1,00,000 lump sum + ₹10,000/month for 60 months).
* **Projected Portfolio Value after 5 Years**: **₹62,40,775**.

# Breakdown of Portfolio Value after 5 Years:

* **Cipla**: ₹8,46,283
* **Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories**: ₹7,87,823
* **Sun Pharmaceuticals**: ₹8,08,006
* **NTPC**: ₹7,37,022
* **Tata Power**: ₹7,56,180
* **Hindustan Unilever**: ₹7,95,875
* **Tata Consumer Products**: ₹7,68,101
* **Nestlé India**: ₹7,41,486

This growth assumes steady market conditions and the projected annual growth rates for each stock.

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Me:** WHAT PERCENTAGE GROWTH?

**ChatGPT:**

The projected percentage growth of your portfolio over 5 years is approximately **791.54%** based on the lump sum and monthly investment strategy. This reflects the overall growth from your initial investment of ₹7,00,000 to the projected portfolio value of ₹62,40,775. **​**

post,1izfqqq,Promoter ownership in Nifty50 companies has fallen to a 22-year low,Broad-Research5220,"According to NSE data, promoter holdings declined by 96 bps sequentially and 167 bps over the past three quarters.

Institutional investors, particularly domestic mutual funds, have stepped in to absorb the divested shares, raising concerns about corporate governance and market stability.

The decline in promoter holdings is part of a long-term trend observed since 2009, with only a brief reversal between 2019 and 2021.

post,1honw22,Do big institutions make candlestick patterns to trap retail investors?,EnvironmentalFox3367,"I feel this many times, especially while seeing stock recommendations from firms like Motilal Oswal or ICICI Securities. Like recently, they entered Cipla at ₹1529, and then it fell to ₹1450 levels, they suddenly gave buy recommendation. It looks like these patterns are made to tempt retail investors to enter, especially when DIIs are sitting on losses because their moves went wrong.

Are retail traders being fooled into predictable entries and exits so big players can recover their losses? What you all think?",2024-12-29 04:17:35,50.0,16.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1honw22/do_big_institutions_make_candlestick_patterns_to/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1honw22,,,,,,,m4bhzzy,Away-Sea-6305,"It's a well known practice, used world wide, not just indian markets.

Whenever you get free time, try to read  "" market wizards ""  (there's even a audio book), where the author interviews top US traders, hedge fund managers about their trading setups. 

Those these are old interviews, they do shed a light on how fund managers act. Most of them give guarded answers, but one hedge fund manager, does state in the interview, that they do actively hunt for stop losses placed by others (retailers/ smaller fund) and move the market to touch it. 

It's an interesting read nonetheless, on understanding on how the market is moved from the perspective of big players.

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1gwaxsv,Need suggesion on my stock investing approach,sasur_ka_nati,"I'm new to investing in equities. Started investing before 5 6 months only, that too mostly in MFs.  
In this current dip, I have started to put in stocks. I'm not chasing high returns right now. Even 12/13/14% is fine for me for now. Investing for long term only (5+ years).  
Since I don't know many technical details, I just check the graph. If the stock has shown consistent growth over the last 5 to 10 years, I invest in it.  
Like: Reliance, Cipla, Indigo, TCS, Nestle. 70% of my stock investment is in such companies only.  
I'm not investing in such companies which suddenly go very high in  1-2  years, (and might later fall more abruptly).

My question is, is this approach ok? Just looking at the historic growth chart, no other analysis.  
I'll be learning more things slowly and check other things, but that will take time. And I don't want to miss this dip actually.

Also water scarcity in cities will increase.. Cost of amenities will increase.. Thus less spending on other stuff..

The Indian markets saw their biggest weekly drop in over two years, with the Sensex falling 4.98% and Nifty50 down 4.76%, erasing four weeks of gains. Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%. However, Nifty Pharma performed well with a 1.55% weekly gain.

**Lets analyze the NIFTY pharma it stocks with the help of RRG**

**Leading Quadrant:** JBCHEPHARMA, MANKIND, NATCOPHARM, GRANULES, DRREDDY, LUPIN, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are currently in the Leading Quadrant. However, LUPIN, NATCOPHARM, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are losing momentum and heading toward the Weakening Quadrant.

**Weakening Quadrant:** LAURUSLABS, BIOCON, TORENTPHARMA, and ABBOTINDIA are positioned in the Weakening Quadrant. Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant. In contrast, LAURUSLABS and BIOCON are exhibiting high negative strength and are drifting toward the Lagging Quadrant.

**Lagging Quadrant:** DIVISLAB, CIPLA, AJANTAPHARMA, ALKEM, and GLAND are in the Lagging Quadrant. Notably, all the stocks, except DIVISLAB, are showing signs of recovery and are attempting to move toward the Improving Quadrant.

**Improving Quadrant:** AUROPHARMA, GLENMARK, and IPCA are in the Improving Quadrant. While AUROPHARMA and GLENMARK are progressing with strong positive momentum, IPCA is struggling to transition into the Leading Quadrant.",2024-12-21 11:59:07,22.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hj8g72/market_records_biggest_weekly_fall_in_more_than_2/,IndianStockMarket

I have been investing for a couple of months now, and I mostly tried to invest in fundamentally strong companies which are fairly valued (except Suzlon lol). 

Needed a review and some suggestion for the road ahead. I plan to hold most of these for long term, and I'm trying to accumulate them whenever the market dips. 

Apart from that I have cash on my hands right now to put in the market and I wanted to ask suggestions about some of the stocks on my watchlist:

* **Defence Stocks**: **HAL,Mazdock and BEL**. They have been projected to do well in the long term but they seem to be extremely overvalued , and have been correcting every now and then these last few weeks. Their quarterly results have been excellent and have been in the news frequently but their momentum right now is confusing and I don't know when to enter
* **Canara Bank and NMDC**: I found them through a custom screener. They appear to have strong financial strength and are undervalued. Canara Bank shows up in so many 'gowth' screeners and NMDC has been a consistent performer (and also government backed). Yet, they've been falling rapidly the last couple of months. I don't know what's wrong with them. I do plan on having them in my portfolio, but again, confused about entering.
* **Cipla:** The pharmaceutical industry has been a great, consistent performer as far as the stock market is concerned, and I plan to have exposure to it though Cipla, as it has great financials and a good valuation (good ROCE and divided yield as well)
* **SBI and ICICI bank:** Held them purely due to some analyst (STRONG BUY) reccomendations, exited them at a minor profit. Don't really know how to analyse bank stocks but they seem to be 'essentials' .

Now when i sell the same in 2024, 75% of the 1994 stocks have already lost the shine. So i would be getting good profit from ""fractions of stocks"" like Unilever/SBI/Reliance who have survived this 20 year ride.  , so ultimately i would be receiving very less profit when i redeem in 2024 as valuations of All other stocks has reduced too much

# 1. Domestic and Global Demand

* Rising healthcare awareness and spending in India.
* Increased exports to the US and European markets, especially in generics and specialty drugs.
* Growth in demand for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) due to supply chain diversification.

# 2. Regulatory Landscape

* Policy support from the Indian government, including PLI (Production-Linked Incentive) schemes for pharma and medical devices.
* USFDA approvals and compliance status impacting exports.
* Patent expiries and new drug launches influencing revenue streams.

# 3. Currency Fluctuations & Export Growth

* A weaker **INR vs. USD** benefits Indian pharma exporters.
* Strong international sales from companies like Sun Pharma, Dr. Reddy’s, and Cipla impact the index performance.

# 4. R&D Investments and Innovation

* Increased focus on biosimilars, novel drugs, and specialty treatments.
* Partnerships and acquisitions to expand product pipelines.

# 5. Market Sentiment & Valuations

* Pharma stocks tend to perform well in uncertain market conditions due to their defensive nature.

The Indian markets saw their biggest weekly drop in over two years, with the Sensex falling 4.98% and Nifty50 down 4.76%, erasing four weeks of gains. Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%. However, Nifty Pharma performed well with a 1.55% weekly gain.

 **Lets analyze the NIFTY pharma it stocks with the help of RRG** 

**Leading Quadrant:** JBCHEPHARMA, MANKIND, NATCOPHARM, GRANULES, DRREDDY, LUPIN, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are currently in the Leading Quadrant. However, LUPIN, NATCOPHARM, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are losing momentum and heading toward the Weakening Quadrant. 

**Weakening Quadrant:** LAURUSLABS, BIOCON, TORENTPHARMA, and ABBOTINDIA are positioned in the Weakening Quadrant. Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant. In contrast, LAURUSLABS and BIOCON are exhibiting high negative strength and are drifting toward the Lagging Quadrant.

 **Lagging Quadrant:** DIVISLAB, CIPLA, AJANTAPHARMA, ALKEM, and GLAND are in the Lagging Quadrant. Notably, all the stocks, except DIVISLAB, are showing signs of recovery and are attempting to move toward the Improving Quadrant. 

**Improving Quadrant:** AUROPHARMA, GLENMARK, and IPCA are in the Improving Quadrant. While AUROPHARMA and GLENMARK are progressing with strong positive momentum, IPCA is struggling to transition into the Leading Quadrant.",2024-12-21 11:53:55,4.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hj8dht/market_records_biggest_weekly_fall_in_more_than_2/,StockMarketIndia

post,1fmd4ae,Review on these health stocks,mesh12222,"Hi all,

I am planning to invest around 5 lacs in some healthcare stocks for the long term (5-7 years). With the entry of private equity into the Indian healthcare sector and rising medical inflation, I am bullish on healthcare for the long term. I have shortlisted the following stocks:

1. Cipla - 
    Large cap, PE: 30, Debt/Equity: 0.02, ROE: 15%, EPS: 53


2. Aster DM - 
    Small cap, PE: 4, Debt/Equity: 0.3, ROE: 2.84% only, EPS: 105


3. Narayana Hrudayalaya - 
    Small cap, PE: 31.55, Debt/Equity: 0.56, ROE: 27%, EPS: 39


4. Kovai Medical - 
    Very small cap, PE: 30, Debt/Equity: 0.35, ROE:  20%, EPS: 177



I am not including stocks like Apollo Hospitals and Max Healthcare at the moment, as they are already overpriced (PE around 100). However, I might consider Fortis.

What should be the allocation percentage in these stocks?",2024-09-21 21:14:49,5.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1fmd4ae/review_on_these_health_stocks/,StockMarketIndia

Basically,if you bought 100 shares of it,you've put 1.5l or so at stake and you're stoploss would be around the low of the consolidation,around some 30-40 ticks,and if you want a looser stop at best 50 ticks at 1450,below which there will be a downmove in earnest atleast briefly until 1400 levels. All,I'm saying is you'll find less risky bets at lower price bands. If you're starting out,50-600 or 700rs ka stock band se try karlo,aur the higher the price lower the allocation se start off. At the end of the day,it's a gamble,atleast let your instincts get sharper before you touch high stakes like these. When you're doing better and see good profits and your chart eye is more honed,take concentrated bets in expensive stocks. Sorry if I offended you or spoke out of line.

post,1i5qqn4,why xomato is about that bullsh!t as on 20-jan-25,Ig1M,"being in main index, that is made up of our country's biggest giant companies, which is laughable.
it is possible it was done to support the stock price, or bring other people's money in, via passive flows, so existing biggies could dump.
if xomato is in sensex, it is 33rd in rank by mcap today. and it was 1/6th just 2 years ago. for how Long it has been in top 30? if it's a mega giant Largecap,it should behave Like it, not Like a b!tch.

its market cap is higher than real companies Like:
Asian Paints/ Siemens/ Nestle India - Britannia/ DLF - Lodha/ VBL/ Tata Steel/ Divis lab - Cipla - mankind Pharma - Dr Reddy - Lupin/ indigo/ Grasim/ SBI Life - HDFC Life/ Hyundai Motor/ Pidilite/ Hindalco/ Ambuja/ Baroda Bank - PNB - IOB/ Polycab - Havells

xomato isn't better than LTIMINDTREE, Tech Mahindra, Coforge, LTTS, Sonata soft, Birlasoft, Cyient, Zensar, Mphasis, TATA Elxsi, KPIT Tech, Honeywell, Tata Tech, Delhivery, BDL, indigo - they fly aeroplane in the air for gods sake, ABB, Persistent, Bosch, OFSS, GMR Airports, BSE the damn exchange, vodafone idea the entire company, BlueDart, etc. thats nuts. 

infact xomato's mcap is more than entire Polycab & Havells combined together, that did 5,498+4,889= 10,387 crores sales in 3 months, whereas xomato sales 5,405: half of above.
half sales, double mcap?

PE of 351 means its equal to 

buying india's highest PAT earning bank SBI share at 28,143 

or buying india's highest PAT earning company Reliance share at 17,946

or buying 1 MRF share at 16 Lakh 11 Thousand, assholess!

after doing every exploitation under the sun, it is a 3% OPM business, and they rely on other income for profit. can't fund own expansion, needs fundraising and someone keeps buying a 4cr sports car each time.

since jan 2024, more and more retail has entered the stock, taking the price from 133 to 302. preferential shares and QIB shares have been allotted to big companies at better prices.

post,1hqbavn,RK Swamy_ A multibegger in Making,carelessNinja101,"**MULTIBAGGER I MEANT. Thoda Mistake ho Gaya. Ignore the Typo.**

This is a legecy Advertising agency catering some of the biggest brands in India.

**Strength-** 

* The Core team sits in Chennai but still their hold on Govt & large clients from the Delhi NCR region is good.
* Legacy of being an old company with some of the industry pioneers.
* 360 degree ad-solution.

**Numbers-**

50 Cr Profit with around 350 cr Revenue in 2024 up from half in 2021.

**Reason for multi-bagger potential-**

Digital marketing & client ad-management is growing multifold every year. RKSwamy will take a large chunk out of that pie & will keep growing for years to come.

**I see this at 1000 by end of 2026.**

post,1hj8gq0,Market records biggest weekly fall in more than 2 years; which sector performed well??,ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/dmy8jefny68e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2daa65a32aa70938d08ab7df0f106a5d7ac0d3ea

The Indian markets saw their biggest weekly drop in over two years, with the Sensex falling 4.98% and Nifty50 down 4.76%, erasing four weeks of gains. Large-cap stocks like Adani Green, LTIMindtree, and Siemens fell over 10%, while mid-cap stocks such as Piramal Enterprises and Torrent Power declined 8-12%. However, Nifty Pharma performed well with a 1.55% weekly gain.

**Lets analyze the NIFTY pharma it stocks with the help of RRG**

**Leading Quadrant:** JBCHEPHARMA, MANKIND, NATCOPHARM, GRANULES, DRREDDY, LUPIN, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are currently in the Leading Quadrant. However, LUPIN, NATCOPHARM, ZYDUSLIFE, and SUNPHARMA are losing momentum and heading toward the Weakening Quadrant.

**Weakening Quadrant:** LAURUSLABS, BIOCON, TORENTPHARMA, and ABBOTINDIA are positioned in the Weakening Quadrant. Among them, ABBOTINDIA has recently entered this quadrant, while TORENTPHARMA is attempting to regain strength and move back into the Leading Quadrant. In contrast, LAURUSLABS and BIOCON are exhibiting high negative strength and are drifting toward the Lagging Quadrant.

**Lagging Quadrant:** DIVISLAB, CIPLA, AJANTAPHARMA, ALKEM, and GLAND are in the Lagging Quadrant. Notably, all the stocks, except DIVISLAB, are showing signs of recovery and are attempting to move toward the Improving Quadrant.

**Improving Quadrant:** AUROPHARMA, GLENMARK, and IPCA are in the Improving Quadrant. While AUROPHARMA and GLENMARK are progressing with strong positive momentum, IPCA is struggling to transition into the Leading Quadrant.

post,1ejvw1g,What stocks do you invest in regularly (SIP)?,avinashbaheti,"
What stocks do you invest in regularly (SIP)?

My top three picks would be:

1. ITC Limited
2. Tips Industries Limited
3. PNGS Gargi Fashion Jewellery Limited

The rationality behind these picks is growth over momentum. ITC Limited is a stock that holds the portfolio together in bad times. The dividend yield is also pretty impressive. Though it is a very old enterprise, I still believe that it has potential to grow and deliver decent returns. I hope the proposed demerger unlocks wealthy to investor.

Tips Industries Limited is a cash rich company that rewards regularly by way of dividends and buy-backs. The music industry is growing and people have started to pay for streaming it. There is some stability in revenues as the company has minimum guarantee deals with global record labels. By demerging the films division, the risk is transferred to the new company, making music the core business for the company. I also think their accounting practices are conservative as 100% costs are written-off in the year of release, thereby keeping the balance sheet light weight.

PNGSGFJ Limited is by far the riskiest amongst the three. It is still a relatively small and new company (market capitalization is less than ₹1,000 crores), yet poised for growth. The name P.N. Gadgil & Sons is a symbol of excellence and trust. The company enjoys this brand legacy. The organized jewellery business is slowly taking over mom-and-pop stores. As a society we are experiencing more women participation in the work force. This leaves women with more disposable income that will further boost the jewellery business. This company is rapidly expanding its physical presence across tier 1 cities. Consumers desire affordable, high quality, fashionable accessories and this company checks all the boxes.

I am eager to know your picks for SIP. That's my two cents, thank you.",2024-08-04 13:58:17,8.0,8.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1ejvw1g/what_stocks_do_you_invest_in_regularly_sip/,IndianStreetBets
