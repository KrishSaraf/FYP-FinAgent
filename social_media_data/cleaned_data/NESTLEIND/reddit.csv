post,1ip2vxn,US will announce list of tariffs on 1st April (countrywise) - Good news for short sellers,curioussharma-007,"https://preview.redd.it/dpq0dze8b1je1.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=8699538a109a1127c6749197786a0b44fb3e8d1e

  
Hey,,  
If you are into short selling like me (and making money in last 2 months), the good news is that US has announced reciprocal tariffs and it will share details on 1st April (country wise), India is already knows as 'Tariff king' as said by Trump.

As a short seller who use AI a lot, here's my research for possible shorting oppurtunity:

# Which Indian Sectors Are at Risk for Tariffs?

Given Trump's trade policies and focus on protecting American industries, these sectors are the most likely targets for tariffs:

# 1. Pharmaceuticals (Exports: $7.55 billion) – High Risk

* The U.S. imports a massive amount of **generic drugs** from India.
* Trump has pushed for **onshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing** in the U.S.
* **Likely action**: Higher tariffs on **generic medicines** from India to protect U.S. pharma firms.

# 2. Precious Metals & Stones (Exports: $10.17 billion) – Moderate-High Risk

* India is one of the biggest exporters of **cut and polished diamonds** to the U.S.
* Trump previously **increased tariffs on Chinese jewelry**; he may do the same to India.
* **Likely action**: Tariffs on **diamonds and jewelry** to promote local manufacturing.

# 3. Electrical & Electronic Equipment (Exports: $9.89 billion) – Moderate-High Risk

* Includes **Motherson Sumi, ABB India, and Exide Industries**.
* India exports **electronic components and auto electronics**, competing with U.S. firms.
* **Trump previously targeted China with tech-related tariffs.**
* **Likely action**: Import duties on **Indian auto electronics, semiconductors, and batteries**.

# 4. Automotive & Auto Parts (Exports: $2.58 billion) – Moderate Risk

* **Hero MotoCorp** and **Motherson Sumi** export motorcycles and auto components.
* Trump previously **imposed tariffs on European & Chinese auto imports**.
* **Likely action**: Tariffs on **Indian two-wheelers and auto components** to support U.S. manufacturers.

# 5. Textiles & Apparel (Exports: $2.64 billion) – Moderate Risk

* India is a **top textile and apparel exporter** to the U.S.
* Trump **previously imposed tariffs on China’s textile exports**.
* **Likely action**: Higher duties on **Indian garments** to boost U.S. production.

# 6. Oil & Petrochemicals (Exports: $6.52 billion) – Low-Moderate Risk

* **Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and ONGC** export refined petroleum to the U.S.
* The U.S. wants **energy independence**, so **tariffs on Indian oil** could be possible.
* **Likely action**: A tariff on **Indian refined oil products**, but impact may be low.

# 7. IT & Software Services (Not in the export goods list, but a huge sector) – Low Risk

* India dominates **IT services and outsourcing** for American companies.
* Instead of tariffs, Trump might **tighten visa rules (H-1B restrictions)**.

However, this is just one parameter, rest you can check in weekly which stocks are already going down and on daily check if they are over bought, this given oppurtunity to enter the market>

I am not against Indian market, I am just a trader who makes money on both sides and right now for this year I am highly bearish.

post,1haa055,review my portfolio PLEASE ,Admirable-Eye6862,"[Direct Equity](https://preview.redd.it/mjbgtu1ust5e1.png?width=565&format=png&auto=webp&s=606ef65ac4da0e4fc037e91a883c7cd940dbbdf5)

[Equity Mutual Funds](https://preview.redd.it/u9ds5agust5e1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=34fb9e55bab4d6fc032912bb2a1bdae3bf825404)

34YO Male. Professional Income. 

Started post-Covid. But a substantial sum out of this has been invested in the last 3-4 months.

Point is to review the portfolio / allocation etc. as it stands today - for the future. That is why I have provided current value of holdings (though invested sum can be calculated pretty easily). Past gains (especially %ages) are indicative of pretty much nothing as I have been irregular in buying and accumulating over the said period.

Would love everyone's views and opinions. 

PS - discerning folks on here will be able to see Saurabh Mukherjea's influence but even more discerning (and sympathethic) folks will be able to see I am reducing the said influence now 😄

LATE (AND LONG) EDIT - As rightly said in some replies, MF portfolio has some unnecessary over-complication. I'm slowly moving my inv from Axis ELSS to PP ELSS (as and when 3 year limit ends), so count one less fund. The two PP funds again I count as basically one big Flexi fund, so that's again one less fund. Small caps I don't feel comfortable with just one fund, and the universe is large enough to accommodate two funds. 
So basically-
•one Largecap (Niftybees) 
•one Flexicap (2 PPs + whatever's left of Axis)
•one Large & Mid
•one Midcap
•two Smallcaps
•one USA (where in fact if someone can suggest which should I actually invest in, anyway PP Flexi can't invest more in the US stocks).

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

After a 24% decline from its all-time high, Nestlé India is now taking support at a key zone that previously acted as strong resistance. On the daily timeframe, the stock has formed an RSI divergence, and today it broke above the neckline of this divergence, closing 4.3% higher while reclaiming the 40-day EMA. Additionally, the breakout is supported by an RMI buy signal across all timeframes. However, the stock faced selling pressure towards the end of the session, resulting in a wick formation. The key question now is whether it can sustain this breakout.

post,1gniuk3,Longterm Investing,Centaurs_,"Im investing in Mutual fund regularly, but wanted to invest bit more on direct equity. I have set aside around 2L for this. Planning to equally distribute the amount among this stocks.

1. JIOFIN
2. RELIANCE
3. PIDILITIND
4. TATAPOWER
5. TCS
6. PRICOLTD
7. TITAN
8. NESTLEIND
9. ICICIBANK

Have stocks from different sector, its Nifty50 heavy, somtime I think, it can be invested in Nifty50 index itself. Having that extra 2-3% leverage is good I believe.

What are your thought?

comment,1ib0o72,,,,,,,m9emrur,curioussharma-007,"# Trading in a Bear Market: Key Strategies

1. **Trade on Both Sides**
   * As a trader, you can take positions on both sides of the market: **long** (bullish) and **short** (bearish).
   * This is a bear market where prices are falling consistently. Instead of waiting for recovery, utilize basic short-selling strategies.
2. **Short Selling Strategy for Futures**
   * Identify stocks that are trending **down** on a weekly timeframe.
   * On the daily timeframe, look for stocks where the **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** is above 70, indicating they are overbought.
   * Enter a short position in futures, as the bias aligns with the downward trend.
3. **Intraday Short Selling Strategy**
   * Use the **ADX (Average Directional Index)** to confirm trends.
   * Look for stocks trending **down** on the daily chart, but with **RSI above 70** (overbought) on the hourly chart.
   * Enter short positions with even lots, set a desired stop-loss amount, and manage your position as follows:
      * Once the trade turns profitable, sell half the quantity equivalent to your stop-loss amount.
      * Let the remaining trade ride until the end of the day.
4. **Why Focus on Shorting in a Bear Market?**
   * This is an ideal bear market where **FIIs (Foreign Institutional Investors)** are consistently shorting.
   * There are **no strong reasons** to expect a market recovery anytime soon.",2025-01-27 05:19:21,1.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1ib0o72/its_a_beautiful_market_start_thinking_reverse/,StockMarketIndia

post,1i4xqhs,Short Sellers Here?,curioussharma-007,"**Hey,**  
  
Are there others here who believe the Indian stock market is bearish right now? I’ve been doing quite well shorting futures and would like to connect with similar traders to discuss strategies and criteria for shorting in more detail. If you’re into this kind of trading, let’s have a deeper discussion and share insights! Here's some of my positions:

After a 24% decline from its all-time high, Nestlé India is now taking support at a key zone that previously acted as strong resistance. On the daily timeframe, the stock has formed an RSI divergence, and today it broke above the neckline of this divergence, closing 4.3% higher while reclaiming the 40-day EMA. Additionally, the breakout is supported by an RMI buy signal across all timeframes. However, the stock faced selling pressure towards the end of the session, resulting in a wick formation. The key question now is whether it can sustain this breakout.",2025-01-31 13:42:29,2.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1ief1lt/nestlé_india_breaks_out_after_rsi_divergence_can/,StockMarketIndia

After a 24% decline from its all-time high, Nestlé India is now taking support at a key zone that previously acted as strong resistance. On the daily timeframe, the stock has formed an RSI divergence, and today it broke above the neckline of this divergence, closing 4.3% higher while reclaiming the 40-day EMA. Additionally, the breakout is supported by an RMI buy signal across all timeframes. However, the stock faced selling pressure towards the end of the session, resulting in a wick formation. The key question now is whether it can sustain this breakout.",2025-01-31 13:44:18,0.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1ief2x8/nestlé_india_breaks_out_after_rsi_divergence_can/,IndianStreetBets
