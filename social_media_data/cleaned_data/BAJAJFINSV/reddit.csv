post,1fhh85g,"BAJAJ Housing Finance IPO, This is what you need to do after Listing. ",cocwiki,"BAJAJ Housing Finance Valuation Check

1. At IPO price, market cap will be at Rs. 58k Cr. IPO is valued at P/Bx of 3.2x
2. Other large size peers like LIC Housing, PNB Housing, Canfin Housing are available at P/B 1.3-2.7x.
3. Smaller players like Aadhar, Aavas, Aptus and Home Finance are available at range of 3.3x to 4.8x.
4. Last 3 years growth - AUM growth of 31% CAGR over FY22-24 with 56% PAT CAGR
5. BHFL has lowest GNPA & NNPA in the industry (best asset quality)

So, considering all parameters - its presence in housing finance & other financing space, its superior growth, and best operational metrics along with Top class proven Promoters - BHFL will attract Premium Valuations.

Listing Price View - As per current GMP  it is likely to List around 100% Gains i.e., Rs. 140-150 range vs issue price of Rs. 70/-.

With such listing, it will be available at P/B of above 6x. Leaves limited upside growth.

Sell on Listing - Price above Rs. 130-140

Hold on Listing - Incase of bad listing with 30-60%.

Fresh Buying - Only below Rs. 100-110 range or else I will wait for market to settle down & wait for price discovery because after a good listing gains, hardly any immediate upside is left.

Even though it's a good company, no point in FOMO. Rather I will now focus on other Housing finance company to see if any re-rating possible in other players.

Note: these are not my views but I follow a SEBI registered expert he shared this. Hope it helps the people who got Bajaj Housing finance IPO allotment.

34YO Male. Professional Income. 

Started post-Covid. But a substantial sum out of this has been invested in the last 3-4 months.

Point is to review the portfolio / allocation etc. as it stands today - for the future. That is why I have provided current value of holdings (though invested sum can be calculated pretty easily). Past gains (especially %ages) are indicative of pretty much nothing as I have been irregular in buying and accumulating over the said period.

Would love everyone's views and opinions. 

PS - discerning folks on here will be able to see Saurabh Mukherjea's influence but even more discerning (and sympathethic) folks will be able to see I am reducing the said influence now 😄

LATE (AND LONG) EDIT - As rightly said in some replies, MF portfolio has some unnecessary over-complication. I'm slowly moving my inv from Axis ELSS to PP ELSS (as and when 3 year limit ends), so count one less fund. The two PP funds again I count as basically one big Flexi fund, so that's again one less fund. Small caps I don't feel comfortable with just one fund, and the universe is large enough to accommodate two funds. 
So basically-
•one Largecap (Niftybees) 
•one Flexicap (2 PPs + whatever's left of Axis)
•one Large & Mid
•one Midcap
•two Smallcaps
•one USA (where in fact if someone can suggest which should I actually invest in, anyway PP Flexi can't invest more in the US stocks).

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1i1a1x6,Bajaj Finserv showing relative strength,tradelyf_bablo,"Relative strength presents itself in different ways.

With everything going down, this stock has shown great strength simply by not correcting. Notably, this comes after a January 2 rating upgrade.

Bajaj Finserv is a very interesting chart in the current environment for several reasons:

1. High relative strength. Stock is bucking the overall market trend and resisting a correction in a very weak market. This shows demand for the stock.
2. The price move after rating upgrade on January 2 was with huge volumes. This shows possible institutional buying in the stock. 
3. Good revenue growth. A constant 20-30% quarterly revenue growth for a mega-cap stock is fantastic.

I am looking at this stock closely and will look to buy if the stock breaks out of the recent consolidation if the overall market conditions start to improve.

post,1dtg7lq,Which stocks to keep in portfolio for long term horizon 15 years?,ShotIndependent2117,"I'm planning to reduce the number of shares (currently at 38) and make additional investment of 10 lakhs in 2024. All these investments are intended for the long term. (10-15 years).

Could you please suggest which shares from my portfolio are absolutely not suitable for long-term holding and which ones I should definitely keep?

Thank you for your advice!

post,1fnix3x,What can be long term stocks now,Homeless-Grandfather,"I have built this portfolio by investing 5k-10k each month for more than 1 year during my internship. Now I am working full time and have more capacity to invest. 

I am looking for long horizon investments. I am sitting on 30-40% cash right now and looking to diversify my portfolio as you can see it is concentrated on Financials and Financial Services heavily. 

I am an investor who likes to buy beaten down stocks, which have good fundamentals but are not in heavy demand right now. 

Have the following sectors in my mind: 

1. Heard alot of steel sector rotation. Thinking of HINDZINC. Dominant player of silver and zinc production. 

2. a) IONEXCHANGE. Water treatment will have growing demand in future. b) JASH INDUSTRIES is involved in manufacturing water pumping and other related machines. 

3. ONGC holds 71% share in crude oil and natural gas production. Gas demand will go up for CNG cars as they are more affordable and do not require EV stations infra. 

4. Please suggest pharmacy/health stocks as Apollo, max all seem highly inflated. I had booked 30% profits on ICICIPRULI this quarter. 

5. Glazing defense stocks as they are beaten down. 

Please suggest any improvements I should make to my pf!!!",2024-09-23 12:13:33,1.0,8.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1fnix3x/what_can_be_long_term_stocks_now/,IndianStreetBets
