post,1g52nlv,Thoughts on infy earnings?,I_am_ChristianDick,"Curious what the general sentiment in India is on one of their largest companies 

Bearish outlook: Infosys Limited (Infy) 

🚨 Bearish Outlook on Infosys Limited (INFY) 🚨

Despite Infosys being one of the leading IT service providers, there are growing concerns that the company might face a challenging road ahead. Here's why I'm taking a cautious stance:

Global IT Spending Slowdown: With clients tightening budgets due to economic uncertainties, Infosys may experience a significant slowdown in new contracts and renewal deals, affecting its top-line growth.

Margin Pressures: Increased operational costs.

Client Concentration Risk: A large portion of Infosys' revenues comes from a few key clients. Any pullback from these major clients could lead to revenue volatility.

Challenging U.S. Market: With heightened regulatory scrutiny and visa challenges in the U.S., Infosys may struggle to maintain its growth trajectory in its largest market. This could particularly impact their talent deployment and client service levels.

Valuation Concerns: Infosys is trading at a relatively high P/E ratio compared to its historical average and peers, suggesting the stock could be overvalued in the current environment. Any earnings miss could lead to a sharp correction.

📉 Technical Weakness: From a technical standpoint, INFY has been showing signs of weakening, with key support levels being tested. A break below these levels could trigger further downside. Nearing a 52-week high into earnings is risky. Whether that be pure speculation or a recipe for disaster.

🚫 While Infosys has long been a leader in the industry, the road ahead looks uncertain, and the risks are mounting. Investors should proceed with caution or consider reducing exposure.

Although, they are looking to expand into the AI industry further. Future acquisitions are costly. And the current AI front runners are not at the level where many of the services may be relevant.

Additionally, consulting industry is on a downwind. Gearing towards further reduced sales moving forward on an already low PEG.",2024-10-16 15:52:21,2.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g52nlv/thoughts_on_infy_earnings/,IndianStockMarket

Now if you have 30-40 shares of Infy you can't sell call option of lot size 400 for hedging. You. Need to have lot size 40.

There are multiple ways of dealing with LTCG tax if you hold gold rather etf.

post,1gtiern,Portfolio review please,dreamer0910,"Background: Till about 1 year ago, I would have referred to myself as a super-diversified hardcore value conscious defensive investor. Still would call myself that but have taken positions in some not-large-cap companies in the last 1 year.

I have 75 stocks in my portfolio but have include 42 in the screenshot below with a sizeable position > 75k

Rationale for the top holdings

1. HDFC Bank: Biggest private sector bank with a focus on retail and growing in Tier-2/3 cities. We are 1 stock market crash away from HDFC Bank rallying. Irony?
2. Angel One: Growing the second fastest in brokers. Fairly valued as compared to Groww but overvalued as compare to Zerodha. Reference Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gb1r0m/want\_to\_go\_yolo\_on\_angel\_one/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gb1r0m/want_to_go_yolo_on_angel_one/)
3. INFY/HCL/Wipro: Most of my positions are more than 2 years old. Now, you can call it Betting on Trump
4. IRFC: Got lucky. Bought at a decent valuation when the stock was 25. Sold 1/3 position at 125 and still hold the remaining 2/3 of the position. Will let it play out because if India needs to move at scale, railways need to be better and more common. Railways get their funding from IRFC.
5. Amara Raja: Betting on a reputed battery company with the most reliable battery brand (Amron). Bought it at decent valuations around 2 years back
6. Divis/Dr. Reddy/NH/Lal Pathlabs: Consumer companies in an economy where focus on healthcare is expected to grow

Total Investment - 70K  
Profit - 22.5 (after taxes)

For Stock options, using chartink scanners and then automating the trades from there to Zerodha. Mostly intra day scanners since i am experimenting with less capital chose options instead of intraday delivery.

Since now the validation is complete, I will try to increase the quantity of the lots and keep you posted next month with P&L.

Rules that i followed -  
Trade in Index and stock options with limited lots 2-4 (based on the lot size)  
Enter into the trade only if the condition is fullfilled (price action strategy)

Don't hold for more than 2% loss  
Trail profilt (This i am still not able to do as market was very volatile)

Trading Psychology - This is most difficult to explain. My goal is to get in and get out as quickly as possible. If there is a moment in the stock, we are just trying to bank on that moment. If it goes against we are not fighting that trend, accept loss and move on. I try to follow this.

comment,1hawp77,,,,,,,m1bxphh,SuperbPercentage8050,"I have given a framework and checklist on r/indiagrowthstocks and be it mid cap or small cap or large cap if any stocks goes through that filter you will end up with high quality stocks and investment. 

The LARGE CAP WONT GO A 100 BAGGER BECAUSE OF SIZE AT A MATURE OR LATE STAGE YOU GET A DECENT 12-15% IF YOU HOLD IT FOR LONG TIME AND THE SECTOR ITSELF HAS A RUNWAY. 

With small and madcap if they operate in sectors that have growth for long periods and they dominate in that sector then you get multi baggers. because the pe expands from 215-20 to 80 and eps grows at same pace. 

for example polycab was a 8-10x because of the secular runway of fiberisation of whole India and pe was 20 so a reasonable valuation. pe expanded a3 times and eps also expanded 3-4 times  so we had a 10x return. 

  
asian paints use to trade at 20-25 pe and same goes for polycab and havells and so may other stocks before then run up. now trading in 2023 at 80-90 pe and growing at 10-15% is not justified that's why they are underperforming because pe will revert back to mean. same happened with Bajaj it was a 80 pe stock and eps went 2.5 times but pe compressed to 27 that's why stock didn't move. 



Growth and long runway is essential for a stock to compound and one needs to invest it at reasonable valuations, today most of mid and small are trading at 70-80 pe so even with all the growth the valuations and price we pay for that growth is not justified.",2024-12-10 08:19:34,11.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hawp77/buy_and_forget_strategy_for_bluechip_stocks/,IndianStockMarket
post,1ivmqy4,This AI Generates Smart Investment Real Time Strategies for Any NSE/BSE Stock – Try It Free!,999thelastpage,"The rise of AI is bridging the gap between everyday investors and seasoned financial analysts. I’ve built an AI-powered tool specifically for the Indian stock market that analyzes any NSE/BSE stock and provides a strategic investment recommendation for the upcoming days.

💡 **Completely free to use** (running at my own expense)  
📈 **AI-driven insights** for smarter investing  
⏳ **Some results are instant**, others take 10-15 minutes for fresh analysis  
💻 **Best experienced on desktop** (mobile works too!)

# How to use it:

1️⃣ Log in to [Great Indian Stock Agent](https://ai-stock.duckdns.org/) and enter the passkey: ***Stock@25*** to access the tool.  
2️⃣ Enter a stock symbol(only symbol like SUZLON, INFY, etc) and an initial capital amount.  
3️⃣ If the stock has been recently analyzed results are instant. Otherwise, AI will take 10-15 mins to generate a detailed plan on how and when to invest to your capital amount. You can exit the screen and comeback later to see the results.  
4️⃣ If you see an error, refresh and retry. If the issue persists, try another stock.  
5️⃣ This is a side project, so I’d love **your feedback** to improve it!

I built this to showcase **the power of AI in investing**—it may not be perfect, but it’s a glimpse into the future. Give it a try and let me know what you think! 🚀

Sample stock code to quickly get the results: TATAPOWER, OLAELEC

P.S: I have built and opened it for this audience so that they can use its resources judiciously as I solely bear the expenses for all the operations. This is built as a side non-profit project, so I apologize for any issues that you might encounter. I will try to answer any questions that you might have. Feel free to share and have fun!

Edit: Based on suggestions, I have made few more changes to get better results. I will keep it accessible for few more days. 

Edit: Update the models to use Gemini 2.5 pro instead of Deepseek R1 for analysis, this should give much better results.",2025-02-22 16:36:31,15.0,17.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ivmqy4/this_ai_generates_smart_investment_real_time/,IndianStockMarket

post,1e79eo1,Why I used to lose money in option buying then not now!! Worth a read if derivative trader ,Effective_Tour6961,"I got tons of messages how can one make money buying options

Here it begins - be with me 

Assuming you know how option functions the premium behaves and how the underlying asset impacts the premium 

See no body wants to buy options like no body willingly atleast, knowing the success probability we hate buying it cause we know the odds are against us fucking 33 percent chance of hitting it sounds lame.

It's the leverage factor that forces us to buy it , we need less margins to enter a trade and the loss is capped right 👍 

Options are treated as best way to make your captial big so u can go more consistent and comfortable trading other instruments.

Not people often neglect the big fat blessings of option buying that it can blast tremendously in one direction 10-200 ho sakta hai.

Now the odds very low of this scenario and catching the exact timing of premium.

One thing is possible that helped to grow my cap
That is to study and anticipate the underlying asset move if in index atleast 3-4 percent directionals move in 3-4 days this is possible like it do not happen everyday but still possible. And you have to it it about 2-3 times in a streak the odds of getting this is also less

Major traders treat options like future like bc 7 points l liye trade lete mat lo bhai mar jaoge ek din 

They buy @100 104 par bechdete gai aur bhai tips dete hai chutiye ye..aur bolege 1st target hit lawde Aisa nahi hota.

Keep sellers in perspective 

OPTION SELLER GAND MARWANE NAHI BAITHE 

there are so many examples like nifty 23800 hai aaj expiry hai aur 2 gnate mai option premium 24000 ka 2 se 120 hogaya keep this in mind they want to close the index below 24000 usme loss Kam hoga unka.

Keeping sellers in mind will help you rationalize your trade 

One more things keep the percentage move in check..

Many trades trade far otm on expiry like every expiry sometimes it's ok koi event hai samja 

How to do it nifty 23600 hai abhi vix 13 hai aur tum 23900 le rahe ho move check kri kitna nikalta hai in our case 1.4% chaiye in the money krne k liye kya ye possible hai har rojj 1.5 taka nahi ata na guru aur agar aata hai tho given index ka konsa stock leke jayega 

Reliance,infy,tcs, ITC kon hai tumhare option ka raja to ye premium ko asman mai le jayega 

Ek baar decent cap ban jaye option buying kabhi kabar kro like 10lakh bana liye tho pehele 10 k 12 kro fir use 2 mai 30-40k option mai trade kro safe feel kri ge.



That's it aur kuch aapki aur se suggestions ho you can reply mujhe bhi Naya perspective chaiye.",2024-07-19 17:30:39,20.0,37.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1e79eo1/why_i_used_to_lose_money_in_option_buying_then/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1e79eo1,,,,,,,ldzkmvy,circusofchaos,"Been trading options for the last 5years.. i second that you need to keep sellers in mind.

But let me tell you what worked for me.. it was a simple thing that I realised, that buyers make money only when sellers are forced to take SL(they do it not like buyers who risk total premium)

So what worked for me was the average traded price.. i used to keep it in check for most of the day.. and i assumed  20-25% is the SL of seller so when price is 20-25% above the Average price it just shoots 

Fast price movement that you are talking about but yeah it just come back after a move.

post,1jmgw56,Large-Cap Stocks (Nifty50): Technical Insights as We Wrap Up FY 2024-25,priteshpalan,"As we approach the end of the financial year, I took a look at the charts of some large-cap stocks (Nifty50). Sharing my observations below—not as calls to buy or sell, but as insights based on price action. Even after 20+ years of studying charts, I still consider myself a learner, and I believe the market always has something new to teach.

# Stock Observations:

🔹 **TATAMOTORS** – Weak unless it crosses & closes above **725**. Sell on rise otherwise.

🔹 **TCS** – Broken previous weekly low; break below 3457 with volume it could fall to **2744**.

🔹 **KOTAKBANK** – Broke out above **1980-2000**; any dip and re-test to this level may offer a **long-term buying opportunity**.

post,1jutt8k,Best Indian stocks to buy for Longterm at current price!,adharshnambiar,"I’m mentioning below few stocks which has good fundamentals and are looking good at current price, I’m expecting 20-25% CAGR minimum on all these stocks below. 

Also consider your risk before investing Lumpsum, cause no one predict what would happen on a short term basis but need not worry for Longterm.


1) CDSL 
2) VBL
3) JSWENERGY
4) REC LIMITED
5) BLUESTARCO
6) KPITTECH
7) RIL 
8) CAMS


My reasons why I feel 

CDSL - India is witnessing a massive rise in retail investors and Demat account openings. CDSL has 75% market share so it benefits from Longterm demat account openings growth. Revenue depends on market conditions.

VBL - They are expanding rapidly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, as far I have read. Their revenue and profit has also been rising at great number on YoY basis.

JSW ENERGY - Most of their Renewable energy plants are to be made operational by the end of 2025 or first quarter of 2026, So I expect they will start to generate Revenue from 2nd or 3rd Quarter of 2026.

REC Limited - They basically finance Power Sector, Almost 100% of their income comes from interests. I also read that they are expanding their business in Infrastructure Financing too, and at current PE of 6 it’s so worthy to add this in your portfolio.

BLUESTARCO - This company makes AC, Refrigerator, Coolers and few others. The rising global temperatures make this stock interesting and also the rising Data centers and Offices also gives this stock a great potential. Comparing with UAE which is 100% Airconditioned, our country is so far behind. Has potential due to its revenue and sales growth too.

KPITTECH - They provide Software solutions for Automobile companies mainly in Europe. I think they might benefit from Rising demand in EV. 

RELIANCE - No need to mention, It’s clearly visible they are slowly shifting towards Retail and Telecom. They are also planning an IPO for Jio this year. I trust Ambani and his big brains. 


CAMS - Just like CDSL but not stocks, they  manage Mutual funds transactions and also has 70% Market share. Just like cdsl this also moves based on Indias growth and mutual funds participation. 


** Please note this is not Fixed Deposit, All these are my Analysis and the 20-25% CAGR is what I’m expecting will happen by 2030.

This is not a stock recommendation, Take this as an education post and do your analysis on top of it. Thank you!",2025-04-09 01:11:22,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1jutt8k/best_indian_stocks_to_buy_for_longterm_at_current/,IndianStockMarket

IT stocks are in demand today as the Nifty IT index hit a record high, driven by optimistic growth projections for the sector, with HSBC forecasting a 6-7% growth in FY26.

**Let's analyze the sector using RRG**

Leading Quadrant: LTIM, Wipro, Persistent Systems, and Mphasis are in the leading quadrant. However, LTIM and Mphasis both are losing strength and are moving towards the weakening quadrant.

Weakening Quadrant: Coforge and TCS are in the weakening quadrant, with TCS appearing weaker than Coforge.

Lagging Quadrant: LTTS, HCL Tech, and Tech Mahindra are in the lagging quadrant. Among them, HCL Tech is gaining strength and moving toward the improving quadrant.

Improving Quadrant: Infosys has just entered the improving quadrant and could regain strength moving forward.

Despite a sharp selloff in the Indian stock market on Monday, the IT sector took the biggest hit, falling by 2.71%. LTIM saw the steepest decline, dropping more than 4%, followed by LTTS, Wipro, HCL Tech, and others.

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1h6g1sx,Need progress review after 10 months. ,topshot14," The first picture depicts the condition of my portfolio 10 months ago. I had just booked profits of 25k and reinvested those in the market.

The next three pictures are my current stocks 

Long term stocks (will prolly hold for 5-10 years)- Tejas networks, infy, HDFC Bank, Zomato(maybe not more than 2-3 years more). Bharat forge and Olectra grrentech- all these have amazing products/services and are backed by great entrepreneurs.

Even Poonawala fincorp is a good one for the next 5 years (I KNOW IT IS DOWN RIGHT NOW) but it's an NBFC backed by Aadar Poonawala.

Mid term - TARC and Idea (I am kinda hoping for an Idea turnaround)

Short term YOLO stocks - Suzlon and rudra evocation

post,1ght9c5,How to add a stock that you want to buy when it's price is going up?,Primary-Editor-9288,"The way I invest is to to buy a stock bit by bit so that if it falls i can average it out. If I want to buy 50k worth of a stock i would deploy 5k-10k at a time. What this has caused me is to miss out on stocks which rallied. For example I wanted to buy Zomato around 190/ share levels, so I first bought 5k worth of it, and was waiting for it to either hold the level or go slightly up or down to add more. it suddenly jumped to 210-220 levels, and I was waiting for it to correct a bit, but then i just to the 280 levels.

post,1fvwipv,"what site or desktop app you'd recommend that has news, heatmaps and various information put together in a single view",jackiethesage,"Basically I am looking for one site where I can just land and watch my entire expectations in single window. A diverse layout where I can have top gainers, losers, sectorial heatmaps, thematic heatmaps, selected portfolio watchlists, and news together. 

Found a similar view in SMC but its not upto the mark. Is there a site you'd recommend that has all the details?

Yesterday, I bought an Infosys call option because a significant portion of its revenue comes from North America, and I was expecting a Trump victory, which I believed would benefit the Indian tech industry. However, I'm a bit concerned now because I anticipated that a Trump win would lead FIIs to return and buy in large quantities, but they sold today instead. I didn't exit the trade today as I'm still expecting it to rally another 5-6%. Hoping FIIs buy tomorrow!",2024-11-06 13:21:13,1.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gkyc9n/bought_infosys_call_yesterday/,IndianStockMarket

post,1jyjczn,Just open-sourced a financial LLM trained on 10 years of Indian stock data — outputs SQL you can run on Db,Cod_277killsshipment,"Hey folks,

Wanted to share something I’ve been building over the past few weeks — a small open-source project that’s been a grind to get right.

I fine-tuned a transformer model (TinyLLaMA-1.1B) on structured Indian stock market data — fundamentals, OHLCV, and index data — across 10+ years. The model outputs SQL queries in response to natural language questions like:

- “What was the net_profit of INFY on 2021-03-31?”
- “What’s the 30-day moving average of TCS close price on 2023-02-01?”
- “Show me YoY growth of EPS for RELIANCE.”

It’s 100% offline — no APIs, no cloud calls — and ships with a DuckDB file preloaded with the dataset. You can paste the model’s SQL output into DuckDB and get results instantly. You can even add your own data without changing the schema.

Built this as a proof of concept for how useful small LLMs can be if you ground them in actual structured datasets.

It’s live on Hugging Face here:  
**https://huggingface.co/StudentOne/Nifty50GPT-Final**

post,1jjf7ig,Why Has INFOSYS' Price Target Been Slashed by 15%?,The_Market_Maven,"Infosys, once the darling of IT stocks, has been going through a rough patch lately. Jefferies just cut its price target for the company by a hefty 15%, bringing it down to ₹1,835 from ₹2,150. Why? Concerns about a slowdown in the US economy. Infosys is trading at 23.93x its forward earnings, making it cheaper than Tata Consultancy Services (26.96x) and HCL Tech (25.50x). So, does that mean it’s undervalued? Some experts think so, but not everyone agrees. However the consensus remains optimistic.

post,1h11xhy,Nifty IT is making new high. Let's get an insight from Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) ,ZestycloseJudgment89,"**Leading Quadrant:** Currently, there are no stocks positioned in the leading quadrant.

**Improving Quadrant:** LTIMindtree (LTIM) and LTTS are gaining strength and have the potential to move into the leading quadrant soon. However, Infosys (INFY) appears to be losing momentum, which may delay its transition to the leading quadrant.

**Weakening Quadrant:** Coforge is in the weakening quadrant, but its rising relative momentum could propel it into the leading quadrant. Similarly, Persistent Systems has been gaining relative momentum recently. On the other hand, Wipro and TCS are showing signs of losing momentum, although both are still maintaining positions above key benchmarks.

**Lagging Quadrant:** Mphasis, currently in the lagging quadrant, is demonstrating strong momentum and may soon transition to the improving quadrant. Tech Mahindra (Tech M) some uptick in momentum but can underperform the benchmark in the near-term.  HCL Tech is underperforming the benchmark and it losing momentum Within IT basket, HCL Tech remains the weakest stock in terms of momentum and relative strength.

As many say,

What’s the issue in holding sectoral ETF/MF and also direct stocks?

Example: I heavily invest in ITBees and also have high amount of shares in TCS, Infy, HCL, Wipro, so what’s the issue? 

I see peoples say if you are buying all IT stocks, rather invest in ITBees itself? I personally don’t get it!

Although I invest in ITBees (for safer reasons), I know all the 4 individual stocks are of high quality - why can’t i invest in them for stock price appreciation + (dividends/bonus/split), remember Wipro just gave 1:1 Bonus, these are just icing on the cake to get such benefits and multiply your wealth in the longer run (ETF/Index funds don’t give them rather it’s a safer bet thingy as mentioned above)

Same goes for Pharmabees + (I invest in DrReddy and Natcopharma)

and 

BankBees + (I invest in HDFC, SouthIndian, IDFC, Planning to start IndusInd as well)

I have heavily invested in Niftybees, ITBees, BankBees and Pharmabees. Today when I was checking the analytics section in my stock broker (Zerodha), all these ETF's are categorized as ""Debt"". Should I be worried about it?

I know individual stocks like HDFCBank, INFY, TCS etc... are all taxed at 12.5% (LTCG). Is the same applies for NiftyBees, ITBees and Pharmabees as well?

T stocks are in demand today as the Nifty IT index hit a record high, driven by optimistic growth projections for the sector, with HSBC forecasting a 6-7% growth in FY26.

**Let's analyze the sector using RRG.**

Leading Quadrant: LTIM, Wipro, Persistent Systems, and Mphasis are in the leading quadrant. However, LTIM and Mphasis both are losing strength and are moving towards the weakening quadrant.

Weakening Quadrant: Coforge and TCS are in the weakening quadrant, with TCS appearing weaker than Coforge.

Lagging Quadrant: LTTS, HCL Tech, and Tech Mahindra are in the lagging quadrant. Among them, HCL Tech is gaining strength and moving toward the improving quadrant.

If I see interest in these lists, I’ll post high momentum stocks from small- and mid-caps as well. I have a couple of smallcases as well (freely available) that are also based on momentum tracking. These have given 79% and 20% returns in the past 14 months and 4 months, respectively.

post,1eg1yeu,"Do you know RBI bans you to buy World's most Liquid S&P500 index fund? But allows you to buy junk international mutual funds, because Ambani is going to enter it. A timeline.",minimized_comment,"
We refuse to give money to rent seekers, non innovative doing, exploiting, wage compressing, pf blocking, insurance denying, companies like Infy, RIL, etc..



Here is how The RBI has been screwing with people like me since 2020.



1 - They banned Indmoney,  SBM bank. 

https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/23/india-central-bank-orders-sbm-local-unit-to-stop-outward-remittance-transactions/




The reason they give is that the RBI can only print rupees, not dollars, which they consider junk currency. How dare a common person refuse to become a bagholder of non-innovative Indian companies!



2 -

They barred mutual funds from investing in overseas markets. Most of the gains made by PPFS mutual funds are due to IEX, CDSL, Google, and rupee depreciation.

https://m.economictimes.com/mf/mf-news/ppfas-mutual-fund-stops-fresh-inflows-in-flexi-cap-fund/articleshow/89223892.cms


Reason : 

How will the sons-in-law of Sitaraman and Gadkari get dollars for their weddings? Who will pay for the foreign trips, sabbaticals, and study tours of worthless government officers, judges, and consultants?.




3 -

They removed indexation from debt mutual funds in March 2023. This means all mutual funds investing in companies that don't pay bribes to government officials, MPs, and MLAs will be taxed at 33%.

https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-removes-long-term-tax-benefits-debt-mutual-funds-source-2023-03-24/



Reason: 

How will the sons, daughters, and cousins of tax-concealing, bribe-seeking, bribe-giving traders do MBA abroad? The shop owner is paying zero taxes, employing 14-year-old children on the shop floor, claiming all deductions, and underreporting profits.


4 -

They banned a very specific type of mutual fund in March 2024, which invests in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq via cheap ETFs like VOO, VTI, QQQ, and QQQM.

https://www.businesstoday.in/mutual-funds/story/sebi-asks-amfi-to-stop-accepting-fresh-inflows-in-overseas-etfs-from-april-1-422416-2024-03-21



This was the *cheapest* way to invest in U.S.  markets for normal people like you and me.




But they have not banned mutual funds that don't buy cheap ETFs but buy stocks and have *VERY HIGH EXPENSE* ratios.

But they are banning you from following the most common advice given by Warren Buffett: keep buying VOO or VTI forever and you'll outperform almost everyone else.

Think about it.

BlackRock is coming and is going to launch a mutual fund for foreign markets. How dare the citizens of India access the U.S. market via a cheap mutual fund investing in cheap Vanguard VOO?

Do they care about you when you invest in crypto? Hell no. They want the dollars to send their children abroad.

That's why they put a 20% TCS on every dollar conversion you do. If you buy $100 of Tesla stock per month, you need to earn $175 per month (around $50 for income taxes, $25 for TCS).

If you even dare to ask for a return in income tax, they reject any claims by opening reassessments of previous years. This means for every $100 SIP in Tesla or Amazon, they will keep taking $70 forever, every month, always.

The RBI is directing all this. Their sons and daughters want to be a better class of Indians abroad. They don't want 'cattle class' Indians doing MS and MBA abroad. That's why they are gatekeeping by depreciating the rupee and blocking every access of the common man to dollar-based companies.

Remember, they want investment from Tesla in India so the land bank they grabbed from farmers using insider information can be overvalued, but they will behead anyone who invests in Tesla by using the Black Money Act.",2024-07-30 19:15:24,442.0,116.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1eg1yeu/do_you_know_rbi_bans_you_to_buy_worlds_most/,IndianStreetBets

post,1kn53h0,"Nifty jumped 500 points today, is this just an expiry play?",Niftymonk,"Just watched Nifty shoot up nearly 500 points from the morning low to the close, and honestly… I can’t find any solid reason for it. No big news, no global trigger, nothing major on Twitter either.

Was it just expiry day madness? Some big short covering? Or maybe option writers got trapped and had to scramble?

The move in the second half especially felt too clean, like someone knew what was coming. Anyone else felt this rally was kind of weird?

Would love to hear your take if you noticed anything.

So guys, today I have taken this well calculated decision of selling all my stocks, harvesting loss and closing my Kite Account.

More or less this is going to be forever. I realize, that I have made some silly mistakes of trading Intra. Which has cost me most of my losses.

I always thought of PayTM Money as an inferior app. It is, but because of its slow and complicated interface which discourages you from taking up Intraday trades, I almost never traded Intra on it. 

As an amateur I made more than 50k profits through PayTM money, while with all the experience I lost a lot with Kite.

However, it has taught me valuable lessons on the usage of stop loss, and knowing the loss appetite. Which is going to always help me.

I am not going out of the market, but I will only be buying Delivery stocks, Mutual Funds, and IPOs. No F&O no Intra,",2024-11-26 18:53:52,101.0,33.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1h0jjuv/one_step_away_from_permanently_closing_my_kite/,IndianStreetBets

post,1jqdyek,Indian IT stocks CRASH! Here's all you need to know!,The_Market_Maven,"The Nifty IT index dropped 4.05%, with Infosys, TCS, and HCL Tech leading the fall after Trump imposed a 26% tariff on Indian imports.

But the bigger worry? Over 50% of Indian IT revenue comes from the US. If the US economy slows, companies may cut Tech budgets, hurting Indian IT firms.

Add AI automation and inflation fears, the road ahead looks uncertain.

Here's a quick breakdown:

* Trump's new tariffs are raising concerns about trade barriers and cost pressures.
* Higher U.S. inflation risks leading to tighter corporate budgets and reduced Tech spending.
* The drop in U.S. Tech stocks is impacting sentiment and demand for Indian IT services.
* The weakening dollar is affecting revenue from U.S. clients.
* AI & automation risks reducing reliance on traditional outsourcing.",2025-04-03 09:29:17,14.0,15.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1jqdyek/indian_it_stocks_crash_heres_all_you_need_to_know/,IndianStreetBets

comment,1fw7fie,,,,,,,lqdl157,None,"Retailers aren't exactly the last to the party but their impact is the highest when the party is about to end, this is a very interesting phenomenon I recently learned about and let me blow your mind.

10,000 stocks being bought by retailers pushes the price higher than a single institution buying 10,000 stocks in a single order, this sounds bizarre I know.

Look up price impact models, this is a market microstructure thing, if a single entity buying 10,000 stocks  once pushes the price up by 1 rupee, 100 people buying 100 stocks each pushes it up by 4-5 Rupees(don't recall the exact scaling factor). So same volume produces a higher price impact when the volume is coming from retailers, so the only parameter to discern retail activity from institutional is velocity of price movement(volatility) per unit volume

Whenever there is upward movement which is 'fast'(volatility>2 standard deviations) it's usually due to retail.

Markets crashing upwards: Blame retail

Markets crashing downwards: Blame institutions

Although I partly agree with you, we're not in an upwards crash frenzy like we were in late 2007 or even 2000 pre dot com bubble crash, for now it's majorly institutional interest.

We're yet to get there and it will be the retail activity blowing up towards the top.",2024-10-04 23:04:14,4.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1fw7fie/where_the_swing_traders_at/,IndianStreetBets

&#x200B;

If your question is ""I have $10,000, what do I do?"" or other ""advice for my personal situation"" questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:

&#x200B;

\* How old are you? What country do you live in?  

\* Are you employed/making income? How much?  

\* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  

\* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  

\* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  

\* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)  

\* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?  

\* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.  .  

Be aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research.
