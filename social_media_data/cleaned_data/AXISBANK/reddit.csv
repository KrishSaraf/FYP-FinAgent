post,1gtiern,Portfolio review please,dreamer0910,"Background: Till about 1 year ago, I would have referred to myself as a super-diversified hardcore value conscious defensive investor. Still would call myself that but have taken positions in some not-large-cap companies in the last 1 year.

I have 75 stocks in my portfolio but have include 42 in the screenshot below with a sizeable position > 75k

Rationale for the top holdings

1. HDFC Bank: Biggest private sector bank with a focus on retail and growing in Tier-2/3 cities. We are 1 stock market crash away from HDFC Bank rallying. Irony?
2. Angel One: Growing the second fastest in brokers. Fairly valued as compared to Groww but overvalued as compare to Zerodha.

3. INFY/HCL/Wipro: Most of my positions are more than 2 years old. Now, you can call it Betting on Trump
4. IRFC: Got lucky. Bought at a decent valuation when the stock was 25. Sold 1/3 position at 125 and still hold the remaining 2/3 of the position. Will let it play out because if India needs to move at scale, railways need to be better and more common. Railways get their funding from IRFC.
5. Amara Raja: Betting on a reputed battery company with the most reliable battery brand (Amron). Bought it at decent valuations around 2 years back
6. Divis/Dr. Reddy/NH/Lal Pathlabs: Consumer companies in an economy where focus on healthcare is expected to grow

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

Axis Bank has been in an uptrend since July 2022, consistently trading above the 40-week EMA. However, it has recently closed below the 40-week EMA, breaking a significant support level and a key trendline.

The RMI (Rohit Momentum Indicator) on the daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes is signaling a sell. Open Interest (OI) analysis reveals a notable shift: OI has reached its peak and continues to rise as prices decline. Initially, from June 2024 to August 2024, increasing OI was accompanied by rising prices, indicating a long buildup. However, since August 2024, OI has been increasing while prices have been dropping, signaling long unwinding.

From September 2024 onward, OI has remained at its peak and continues to increase as prices fall, clearly indicating the formation of a short buildup.

Given these signals, could this suggest a further downside for Axis Bank? What is your own view?",2024-12-23 13:21:15,1.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hknmdy/axis_bank_signs_of_a_trend_reversal_is_a_deeper/,IndianStockMarket

post,1hare3k,AXIS BANK - 10/12/2024,Kooky-Effort-6854,"**On daily chart,** the price recently formed a bearish engulfing pattern when the price was near a resistance zone.

As the price is in downtrend and as the recent trip to resistance was rejected by the seller, the price will form another bearish candle to continue the downtrend.

This is not volume delta. Volume delta columns are different from it. This is something else that i could not find. 

Is it volume indicator or something else. Do you know? Please tell if you know.

I do not have paid subscription of this website. I took this screenshot from YouTube video.

post,1exq03o,Confused about profit booking vs hold for my stocks,curious_investr,"I have few stocks, where I have decent unrealized profit but they are still away from my target. I am confused about profit booking or should i hold till target. I dont want to reduce overall CAGR to achieve my target.

I invested in these stocks mainly because of their solid history, potential to grow. These stocks are already big names but I found these having potential to grow because of their sectors.

|Stock|Buy price|current price|my set target|holding period|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|5paisa|340|517|1000|2.5 years|
|astral|1537|1890|2500|2 years|

|balkrisind|2083|2845|4000|1.5 years|
|indigopnts|1300|1470|3000|1.5 years|
|tatasteel|106|152|250|2 years|

What would be the right strategy to exit from these stocks. If i continue to wait for target, I may reduce my overall CAGR.",2024-08-21 13:43:45,3.0,10.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1exq03o/confused_about_profit_booking_vs_hold_for_my/,IndianStockMarket

Intraday I mostly trade as per the trending sectors, and then selecting the stocks which have moved less compared to the other stocks and enter those.

Capital used for today’s trades is approx 1.2L, was planning not to deploy more than 1L but market was trending so deployed slightly more.

Have been reading a lot of posts here everyday which describe how it’s almost impossible to make money trading. Just want to let everybody know, that it’s not impossible, but the learning curve is VERY steep. And by the time most people reach the end of this curve, they’ve blown up multiple accounts, and also end up destroying the other MOST important thing, which is their mindset.

So please remember, always start small. Take more swings and wait patiently for your setups to form. Risk very little in intraday as market doesn’t trend everyday, atleast not all the sectors. Some will trend daily but you need to get the flow right, which again takes a lot of time. Risking and making less intraday is crucial, which lets you ride your swings fully. 5-6 days like today and I can make a 6 figure income, which I’d say at my level is extremely good

And also, having a source of income alongside trading gives you a peace of mind. Not forcing you to take the substandard setups/trades. 

If you be disciplined, less greedy and fully focused on what you do, the money eventually comes. Stop focusing on daily/weekly results and be fully in sync with the process. There is indeed light at the end of this tunnel, provided you don’t stray from the correct path :) ",2025-02-11 15:16:25,3.0,9.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1in0vov/growth_in_my_trading_journey_happy_to_go_slow_and/,StockMarketIndia

post,1k1ahgp,Trades breakdown✌️,nafi_najeeb,"I took an overnight position on BHARTIARTL yesterday because it has broke its all time high, daybefore yesterday and sustanined above that level for a day. Also there was quite a nice move to the upside near 3 pm yesterday. So i expected a break out move today and my risk was only 500 in this case.

As i expected it brokeout from that level.
Today market opening was lil confusing and tricky till afternoon soo i booked 650 profit.


And also in the case of AXISBANK. I had bullish view but i noticed some serious selling in axis bank at the beginning of market open so i book a small loss. But afternoon it moved upside 

And another trade was in BRIGADE ENT. I noticed some big buying in that stock and with my setup i took a trade. It moved in my favour(1.5x r/r) but i didnt booked profit expecting it to rally because market was in fire mode!! But end of the day also i noticed another big buying at the same level.and the move didnt happened yet. Expecting it to happen on monday. I will wait for my set up. Letsee

Anyway my netloss for today after tax and brockerage is -17

On December 23, 2024, I shared my analysis of Axis Bank, highlighting several bearish signals that pointed towards a potential downside. As discussed, the short buildup occurred, and the market responded accordingly. Since my analysis, Axis Bank has seen a significant **13% drop**, aligning perfectly with the bearish scenario I outlined.  
The **short buildup is still ongoing**, as Open Interest (OI) continues to rise while the price declines, further dragging the stock down.  
This result once again highlights the importance of thorough technical and market analysis.

post,1k1agwz,Trades breakdown✌️,nafi_najeeb,"I took an overnight position on BHARTIARTL yesterday because it has broke its all time high, daybefore yesterday and sustanined above that level for a day. Also there was quite a nice move to the upside near 3 pm yesterday. So i expected a break out move today and my risk was only 500 in this case.

As i expected it brokeout from that level.
Today market opening was lil confusing and tricky till afternoon soo i booked 650 profit.


And also in the case of AXISBANK. I had bullish view but i noticed some serious selling in axis bank at the beginning of market open so i book a small loss. But afternoon it moved upside 

And another trade was in BRIGADE ENT. I noticed some big buying in that stock and with my setup i took a trade. It moved in my favour(1.5x r/r) but i didnt booked profit expecting it to rally because market was in fire mode!! But end of the day also i noticed another big buying at the same level.and the move didnt happened yet. Expecting it to happen on monday. I will wait for my set up. Letsee

Anyway my netloss for today after tax and brockerage is -17

",ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/ou26rli7nl8e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5521fa383d74e27eb9ebd6d0a54d12350be6fc28

Axis Bank has been in an uptrend since July 2022, consistently trading above the 40-week EMA. However, it has recently closed below the 40-week EMA, breaking a significant support level and a key trendline.

The RMI (Rohit Momentum Indicator) on the daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes is signaling a sell. Open Interest (OI) analysis reveals a notable shift: OI has reached its peak and continues to rise as prices decline. Initially, from June 2024 to August 2024, increasing OI was accompanied by rising prices, indicating a long buildup. However, since August 2024, OI has been increasing while prices have been dropping, signaling long unwinding.

From September 2024 onward, OI has remained at its peak and continues to increase as prices fall, clearly indicating the formation of a short buildup.

Given these signals, could this suggest a further downside for Axis Bank?",2024-12-23 13:22:55,2.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1hknnft/axis_bank_signs_of_a_trend_reversal_is_a_deeper/,IndianStreetBets
