post,1inm3uc,"Why OMC Companies Like HPCL, IOC, and BPCL Are a Bargain Buy",Full_Employment_9502,"

The share prices of OMCs have fallen significantly from their all-time highs, making their valuations very attractive.
These stocks are trading at lower P/E ratios compared to their historical averages and other high-growth sectors.
Crude Oil Outlook Favors OMCs

With Trump in power and his push to boost U.S. crude oil production, global oil prices are unlikely to surge.
A stable crude price range of $65-$75 will help OMCs maintain refining margins and reduce earnings volatility.
Under-Recoveries & Government Support

OMCs are currently facing under-recoveries on LPG sales, estimated at ₹30,000 crore.
The government has already provided ₹12,000 crore in subsidies, and additional support is expected, which will directly improve their financials.
Government Backing & Policy Support

The government holds a majority stake in all three OMCs, ensuring long-term stability and financial backing.
Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has been praising the financial performance of OMCs, signaling continued government confidence in the sector.
The disinvestment of BPCL was scrapped, indicating that the government sees growth potential in oil marketing companies.
High Dividend Yield – A Major Advantage

OMCs offer strong dividend yields of 6-9%, which are comparable to fixed deposit (FD) returns.
This makes them an attractive investment for long-term investors looking for stable returns along with potential capital appreciation.
Better Value Compared to Overvalued Stocks

Instead of chasing high P/E stocks like Zomato, Dixon, and Trent, investors should focus on OMCs, which offer a much better risk-reward ratio.
These stocks provide gradual wealth generation along with yearly dividends, making them a solid choice for long-term portfolios.",2025-02-12 08:04:24,29.0,28.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1inm3uc/why_omc_companies_like_hpcl_ioc_and_bpcl_are_a/,IndianStockMarket

post,1jaygwq,Any dividend investors here?,Solitary_Iceberg,"I have observed that dividend investing is almost considered a dirty word in this sub. The reasons are fair enough, with dividend being taxed as income from additional sources, making it less efficient than capital gains.

That being said, I'm one of the few old fashioned investors who like a steady cashflow over time, and eventually plan to retire and live off my dividends.

Given market upswings and downturns, dividend investing can give one some degree of mental peace. Investing in dividend value generators, especially during market downturns, can lead to situations down the line where your dividend income per share is greater than the price of the stock (Eg: CPCL).

This sub comprises of people chasing high growth, exciting stocks at extremely high PEs, often in triple digits. I want to know how many of you invest in unglamorous and low PE stocks like PFC, seeking steady dividend growth over time rather than high risk, high reward trades.",2025-03-14 07:36:33,88.0,118.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1jaygwq/any_dividend_investors_here/,IndianStockMarket

comment,1ks2yyx,,,,,,,mtilck2,Electronic_Usual7945,"

Different websites use different methods to calculate dividend yield.


The basic formula is:
Dividend Yield (%) = (Dividend / Share Price) × 100


For example, if the recent dividend is 3 and the stock price at the time of the dividend announcement was 138 for IOCL, the yield would be about 2.2%, which is accurate.


However, other scenarios exist:


If no dividend has been paid recently, some screeners use the current stock price combined with the most recent dividend amount to estimate the dividend yield.- Screener

post,1j6b4g7,Lumpsum investment- Dividend stocks or MF?,Shre7777,"Hi community, wanted help on an issue. 
I (37 M) have recently resigned from my company and joining a new company. Will be getting Gratuity + Full & Final settlement of ₹6.8 lakhs. 
I have seen one of my friends who had bought 15,000 shares of IOCL some years back and enjoying the dividend payout every year. He gets ₹1.5-2 lakhs a year from IOCL alone and all his monthly bills & expenses are covered by dividends from IOCL & ITC. I want to follow in the same way and invest lumpsum now and then keep investing every month to accumulate and get a healthy dividend payout every year. Planning on IOCL.
My wife does not agree with this and wants me to invest in a stable large cap MF. 
Wanted the community’s views on this. What should be done? 

TLDR- Getting Gratuity and can’t decide to invest in dividend stocks or MF.

post,1g4uwd2,Indian PSU Stocks – % Fall from Highs and Potential for Recovery,altinvestindia,"Saw this table showing the performance of some well-known Indian PSU (Public Sector Undertaking) and related stocks, specifically highlighting how far they’ve fallen from their 52-week highs and how much they would need to rise to retest those highs.

Some Highlights :

* **Cochin Shipyard (COCHINSHIP)**: Down 43% from its high of ₹2912, it would need a 75% gain to retest that high.
* **MRPL**: Has seen a 40% decline and would need a 68% recovery to hit its previous high.
* **GRSE, HUDCO, ITI**: All showing falls of over 30%, with significant room for potential recovery (50-70%).

On the lower end:

* **NTPC, GAIL, BPCL**: These stocks are only down 4-6% and need relatively smaller recoveries (6-8%) to retest their highs

How many of you are stuck in these stocks and invested due to the hype and hoopla during the first half of the year.

* In India, **retail fuel prices (petrol/diesel)** often don’t drop when global crude prices fall.
* That means oil marketing companies (OMCs) might **enjoy higher margins** — they’re buying cheaper but selling at the same old price.",2025-04-18 04:47:57,0.0,10.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1k1wr4k/oil_prices_have_hit_a_3year_low_is_this_a_smart/,IndianStockMarket

post,1ixlgvp,"Jio finance being added to nifty 50, still a mystery?",1xaonc,"Jio Financial Services Limited (JFSL) was listed in August 2023 after being demerged from Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) to unlock the value of RIL’s financial services business.

JFSL formed a joint venture with BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management company. Both parties committed to investing $300 million (₹2,500 crore) each as an initial investment to build a “digital-first asset management business.”

All of this seems promising, but what exactly is Jio Finance trying to become? As of now, only ₹117 crore has been invested in JFSL, with more to come over the next several years. It is currently expanding into multiple sectors:

1. Asset & Wealth Management.

		SEBI has approved JFSL to launch its first mutual fund in 2025.

2. Lending & Credit Services.

		Plans to offer consumer loans, SME financing, and secured loans.

3. Insurance.

		Exploring potential entry into life, health, and general insurance with a digital-first approach.

4. Payments & Banking. 

	    Jio Payments Bank, a joint venture with SBI, is already operational, offering UPI and banking services.

5. Stock Broking & Advisory.

	      Launched Jio BlackRock Broking Private Limited to offer stock trading and advisory services.

6. NBFC.

		JFSL has NBFC status, allowing it to lend directly without being a bank.
		Expected to enter housing finance, auto loans, and SME loans.

Here's where the real uncertainty comes. JFSL is in every sector and no doubt might disrupt this too being a conglomerate but a company like jio which is barely operational is replacing Bharat Petroleum a well established company

While JFSL is expanding aggressively, its business strategy lacks clear direction.

JFSL holds a 6.1% stake in Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). With RIL’s current market cap at ₹17.4 lakh crore, JFSL’s stake alone is worth nearly ₹1.4 lakh crore.

However, JFSL’s own market cap was initially just ₹20,000 crore, which means that its valuation was massively inflated due to its RIL stake, rather than its core financial services business.

JFSL is trying to enter every financial sector at once, asset management, broking, lending, payments, insurance, NBFC, and fintech instead of focusing on one vertical and expanding from there

Even its Jio BlackRock AMC got SEBI approval, yet the mutual fund is still not operational, and its revenues, profits, and assets remain uncertain and nothing is sure about the company's balance sheet yet about what's happening.


Added to Nifty 50 But Does It Deserve It?

Despite its lack of execution, JFSL will be added to the Nifty 50 on March 28, 2025, replacing BPCL.

Zomato will replace Britannia in the same reshuffle, might make a post on it later.

JFSL’s inclusion is primarily based on its free-float market capitalization, not its financial performance.

It recently corrected due to overvaluation. Despite holding only 6.1% of RIL, it was given an inflated market cap and is now being added to Nifty 50.


Jio Financial Services just seems to me like a reliance backed company without any plans in the near future just going into every sector possible but at this point the company just seems too new to be added to the nifty 50, what are your thoughts?",2025-02-25 03:29:13,53.0,8.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ixlgvp/jio_finance_being_added_to_nifty_50_still_a/,IndianStockMarket

post,1knw38w,Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited VS Reliance Power Limited,no1vv,"A. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited  
B. Reliance Power Limited

For each, the following eight metrics are provided:

• CSS (Composite Score Sentiment)  
 – Scale: 1–10  
 – Significance: Reflects overall investor sentiment, with a higher score indicating a more positive outlook.

• EMI (Earnings and Market Influence)  
 – Scale: 0–100  
 – Significance: Measures earnings impact on market influence. A higher value implies strong market traction.

• VARS (Volatility Adjusted Return Score)  
 – Scale: 0–100  
 – Significance: Accounts for risk-adjusted returns in volatile markets, with higher values pointing to efficient performance under risk.

• CSI (Catalyst Strength Index)  
 – Scale: 0–100  
 – Significance: Gauges the strength and consistency of market catalysts driving performance.

• LQI (Liquidity Quality Indicator)  
 – Scale: 0–100  
 – Significance: Assesses asset liquidity and ease of execution in the market.

• STOI (Short-Term Outlook Indicator)  
 – Scale: 1–10  
 – Significance: Forecasts near-term performance prospects. Improvements here signal quick recovery or growth.

• MTOI (Medium-Term Outlook Indicator)  
 – Scale: 1–10  
 – Significance: Offers a view on intermediate performance expectations.

• LTSS (Long-Term Stability Score)  
 – Scale: 1–10  
 – Significance: Reflects long-term stability and resilience, with higher values indicating greater sustained performance confidence.

A. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited  
 CSS: 8  
 EMI: 75  
 VARS: 70  
 CSI: 80  
 LQI: 85  
 STOI: 8  
 MTOI: 8  
 LTSS: 9

B. Reliance Power Limited  
 CSS: 8  
 EMI: 65  
 VARS: 75  
 CSI: 85  
 LQI: 90  
 STOI: 7  
 MTOI: 8  
 LTSS: 7

Each metric is in line with the narrative focus of the reports, confirming a consistent relationship between data and qualitative insights.

**Aggregated Quantitative Comparison**

A. Calculation of Total Scores

• Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited:  
 Total = 8 + 75 + 70 + 80 + 85 + 8 + 8 + 9 = 343

• Reliance Power Limited:  
 Total = 8 + 65 + 75 + 85 + 90 + 7 + 8 + 7 = 345

The aggregate scores show that Reliance Power Limited edges out slightly with an overall score of 345 versus 343 for Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited—an approximate 0.58% improvement.

B. Metric-Specific Comparison and Percentage Improvements

1. EMI (Earnings and Market Influence)  • Hindustan: 75  • Reliance: 65  • Difference = +10 points in favor of Hindustan  • Percentage improvement (relative to Reliance): (10/65) × 100 ≈ 15.38%
2. VARS (Volatility Adjusted Return Score)  • Hindustan: 70  • Reliance: 75  • Difference = +5 points in favor of Reliance  • Percentage improvement (relative to Hindustan): (5/70) × 100 ≈ 7.14%
3. CSI (Catalyst Strength Index)  • Hindustan: 80  • Reliance: 85  • Difference = +5 points in favor of Reliance  • Percentage improvement (relative to Hindustan): (5/80) × 100 ≈ 6.25%
4. LQI (Liquidity Quality Indicator)  • Hindustan: 85  • Reliance: 90  • Difference = +5 points in favor of Reliance  • Percentage improvement (relative to Hindustan): (5/85) × 100 ≈ 5.88%
5. STOI (Short-Term Outlook Indicator)  • Hindustan: 8  • Reliance: 7  • Difference = +1 point in favor of Hindustan  • Percentage improvement (relative to Reliance): (1/7) × 100 ≈ 14.29%
6. LTSS (Long-Term Stability Score)  • Hindustan: 9  • Reliance: 7  • Difference = +2 points in favor of Hindustan  • Percentage improvement (relative to Reliance): (2/7) × 100 ≈ 28.57%

• CSS and MTOI are identical for both reports (score of 8), suggesting equal investment sentiment and medium-term outlook.

High-Level Qualitative Insights and Rationale

• Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited demonstrates strong performance in earnings influence (EMI), a promising short-term outlook (STOI), and superior long-term stability (LTSS).  
 – The EMI advantage (15.38% higher) underscores the company's robust market traction.  
 – An enhanced STOI (14.29% better) indicates a more promising near-term trajectory.  
 – The LTSS result is noticeably higher (28.57% improvement) which is critical for investors prioritizing sustained resilience.

• Reliance Power Limited leads in risk-adjusted returns (VARS), catalyst strength (CSI), and liquidity (LQI).  
 – A higher VARS (7.14% improvement) signifies more effective performance amid market volatility  —a key factor for risk management.  
 – Its CSI and LQI scores (6.25% and 5.88% improvements, respectively) indicate that the asset benefits from stronger driving forces and better trade execution conditions.

The qualitative narratives in both reports corroborate these quantitative advantages. Reliance Power’s higher liquidity and catalyst scores may appeal to investors seeking assets that can adapt quickly under changing market conditions. In contrast, Hindustan Petroleum’s superior EMI, STOI, and LTSS suggest it may provide a more stable investment for those with a long-term, risk-averse perspective.

# Conclusion

Reliance Power Limited stands out based on liquidity, catalyst strength, and risk-adjusted performance improvements. This data-driven recommendation is supported by a balanced integration of quantitative metrics and qualitative insights, ultimately framing Reliance Power Limited as the more strategically attractive investment under current market conditions.

What's your take on it?,sandymartin07,"Recently, Kotak Institutional Equities suggested a 'Sell' rating on oil & gas stocks like IOC, BPCL, HPCL, GAIL, Oil India, and Petronet LNG, citing diminishing prospects of future growth beyond a limit. What do you make of it? I myself have fair exposure to some of these stocks and believe the energy & power sector isn't going to die out soon. Recently, they also had similar verdicts about Titan and Lupin, and the shares saw substantial movement the next day.

Companies like IOCL, BPCL, HPCL etc are downstream oil companies. They buy crude oil from upstream companies, either domestic or foreign, refine it within their refineries, then transport the oil from their refineries to fuel stations all across the country.

Regarding the petrol/diesel price staying stable, that's by design.

post,1gte06v,Where are NIFTY50 stocks headed? What can be the next course of action?,Ok_Set_6991,"With the Q2 results season being dull and FIIs selling off daily, the DIIs and the government would prefer to prevent the NIFTY50 index from falling much so that retail investors do not lose hope and stop the SIPs.

That being said, more interesting developments are going on such as Zomato and JioFin being poised to replace BPCL and Eicher Motors in the NIFTY50 index during its rebalancing in March 24.

This obviously means more funds will go into Zomato and JioFin as a part of NIFTY50 SIPs. Will this be the perfect time to start buying Zomato and JioFin shares?

Also, Asian Paints is facing hard times due to the competition from Grasim and a similar story for many NIFTY50 companies that have reported a decline in revenue/profits. Which companies from NIFTY50 (top 5, top 10, etc) are considered best to invest in right now considering the recent and previous quarters' earnings, growth potential, and other similar factors?

post,1g6mbtz,Are Dividends Really Good?,Smooth-Exchange5814,"Do you invest in high dividend yield companies?   
  
I see a lot of investors buying stocks, which have high dividend yields, with the argument that dividend would be as good as investing in fixed deposit and capital appreciation would be a bonus.  
  
Well I feel there's a problem with companies giving high dividends in India due to our tax structure, we pay double taxes on dividends.  
  
So just suppose, your company has a profit before tax of 100 rupees, with a corporate tax rate of 25% (Yes individuals pay more taxes than corporate), company's PAT(Profit after tax) would be 75 rupees and if you get this 75 rupees as dividend you will pay again 30% taxes(UHNIs would be paying even higher taxes) the money received by you finally would be \~52.5 rupees. So out of the 100 rupees pre-tax, government keeps \~47.5 rupees. This may be okay for the companies where government owns majority of the stake(because the tax is also going to government ). But for a private company giving \~INR 48 to \~INR 50 to government is only possible if company doesn't see any growth opportunity.  
  
So don't buy the stocks just because the dividend yield is high, the company's paying high dividend only making the government rich.",2024-10-18 16:28:35,7.0,9.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g6mbtz/are_dividends_really_good/,IndianStockMarket

post,1eqm9rf,Top 10 Dividend paying stocks ,FlatwormOptimal5521,"  
 

# Top 10 Dividend paying stocks 

Dividend-paying stocks are shares of companies that distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders at regular intervals, typically quarterly. 

These dividends can provide a reliable source of income, making them attractive to investors seeking steady returns, such as retirees or those looking for stability.

Dividends are paid out of a company’s earnings and are usually expressed as a cash amount per share or additional shares of stock. 



||
||
|**S.No.**|**Highest Dividend Paying Stocks in India 2024**|**Annual Dividend per Share**|
|1.|Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)  |₹45|
|2.|Hindustan Zinc Limited  |₹33|
|3.|Coal India  |₹21|
|4.|Vedanta Limited|₹16|
|5.|Power Finance Corporation Limited|₹14|
|6.|BPCL  |₹13|
|7.|ITC  |₹12|
|8.|Indian Oil Corporation (IOC)  |₹11|
|9.|NTPC ltd.  |₹10|
|10.|Power Grid Corporation of India Limited  |₹7.75|



The dividend yield, calculated as the annual dividend divided by the stock’s current price, helps investors assess the income potential relative to the stock’s value.

Investing in dividend-paying stocks can also offer benefits beyond immediate income, including potential for capital appreciation and compounding returns through reinvested dividends. 

Companies that consistently pay and grow their dividends often reflect financial stability and operational success. 

However, it’s crucial to evaluate the sustainability of dividends alongside the company's overall financial health.

We have developed some algorithms using AI models to help us avoid bad investments.*

Hi,

Our motto is to help Retail Investors including ourselves: **#avoidbadinvestments**

There is nothing wrong in your pick. Only thing that happened was due to US elections, FIIs sold almost 10-12 billion dollars and were still doing it until last week. It was just a basic wrong time to enter into stocks.

What we did was we ran our AI algorithms on the stocks you have mentioned above. And this is what it thinks based on the businesses historical performances and recent quarters.

* *RVNL: Its ROCE improved to 19%. Based on recent data Target is 1075 INR.*
* *BAJAJ HOUSING FINANCE: Its operating margin improved significantly.* 
* *BPCL : Business is doing great in recent quarters. Hold patience. Target 358 INR*
* *TATA MOTORS : It can take time to get back to ATH. It will fluctuate for a while.*
* *TATA POWER : India will focus more on power sector. Based on recent data 904 INR.*

We have provided more details here: [https://youtube.com/shorts/tohqpPTSUps](https://youtube.com/shorts/tohqpPTSUps?feature=share)

**Hope this helps. Let us know.**

We also track **big bulls investment** and run the AI model on those.

Here is the complete list of big bulls investment this week and the high trading and delivery stocks .

The falling knife thing does not apply to tata motors because the PE hasnt changed much the management is good and the ev space will see growth eventually its not a small or mid cap so its chill.
Beyond that market as a whole is red overall. 
tata motors are going through a demerger i think the date is next year December so the stock is likely to consolidate or fall due to demerger pains and then we will see what happens depending on if auto sector recovers and/or nirmala tai gets her shit together. So your one year plan may not work, if you dont like that idea you should sell and cut losses or stay and be patient.

comment,1hrqodi,,,,,,,m5234oc,SuperbPercentage8050,"INDIA MART THE BUSINESS MODEL IS AMAZING you just purchased at wrong valuations and overpay, its a compounding machine if you hold for long term.

Alkyl amines is a commodity company and lacks pricing power so get rid of it because its still trading at 54 PE and Saurabh Mukherjee marketed this company at ridiculous valuations.

Yes bank just sell, if you want banking then stock with Kotak and HDFC Bank. they are high quality available at decent valuations

SBI you can expect anything between 10-12% returns based on their moat and growth rates.The negative tailwind is psi management and the past bank rally euphoria is over.

Arctic long term is good but you overpaid on this one again. You dont make money for 2-4 years if you pay high multiples of 60-70 even if earnings are compounding at decent pace because of mean reversion and pe compression. Arctic fundamentals are growing but the pe is compressing.

Cochin just get rid of it because the growth of next 5 years is already factored in the stock and a compression on multiple can drag it down 20-40%

asian paints long term is fine, but dont average it before the multiples reaches on 30-35 range, its still expensive given the slowdown in consumption and the pace at which its growing.

JIO 100 PE, you wont make  money on such multiples, and margin of safety is zero, one bad execution or news and you can see the stock crashing.,

Sail Is shit company just get out of it and allocate to high quality compounders.

Sharda motors is growing earnings and the valuations are not expensive so you can hold that one. 

Adani Wilmar, well the revenue have remain stagnant for past 4 years and increase in profit was due to financial act of increasing the other income.Its not a high quality company plus there margin profile is weak. Move to better companies who's management you can trust, plus always look at margin profile.

  
If you want any further help you can DM. 

Always screen your stocks through a high quality checklist before investing and never overpay.

One basic issue with your portfolio is that you overpaid for growth and purchased most of stock at 60-80PE, you must have probably came during covid and don't have basic understanding about how markets will behave in long term and how mean reversion destroys wealth.",2025-01-02 19:42:11,4.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hrqodi/should_i_exit_or_increase_holding_if_exit_how_to/,StockMarketIndia
comment,1hrqodi,,,,,,,m524j5o,SuperbPercentage8050,"Well the business is good and eps is growing, you overpaid at 60-80 PE. If you will overpay and buy stocks at such valuations you will have to see negative returns and waiting period of 3-5 years. 

India mart is also going through same stages, 

since 2021 EPS has almost moved up 100%, but because the PE compressed from 100 to 30 you are seeing negative returns.

long term its a compounding high quality business, but 100PE any stock cannot sustain for long and they will revert to mean. same happened with asian paints and will happen with all the stocks trading at ridiculous valuations and growing earnings at 10-15%.

Alkyl Amines is a commodity business and lack pricing power, Saurabh mukhaejea marketed it and people went for it at 100-120 PE. 

so its a learning lesson.

Grab any 2-3 sectors Like FMCG IT AND AUTOMOBILE 
Then choose 2 companies for fmcg 2 for it and 2 for automobile 
Like this
But for as your funds are new so get only 1-2 sectors
Jaise m&m is on boom while tatamotors is consolidating so if you got both it will help

post,1iesv96,Would like some knowledge and criticism,Debyte404,"
I would like some tips and criticism as m new to individual stocks, I mainly do mutual funds (almost 60k) The stocks at the lower end I bought either randomly or because a friend told to, I was very new The top stocks are ones I chose by researching a bit Would appreciate your opinions Also is tata motors a good stock?, is there some stock i should sell off like ease my trip? Zomato? I mean Zomato sounded promising but then about the quarterly results plus the PE is sky high, would it make sense to still keep it I m looking for long term cuz ik it would take years to get some reasonable experience. Would appreciate everyone's piece of knowledge 

I have attached my mf portfolio and I checked the overlap, didn't find much
And all the money was just my freelanced income(developer), I kept some for myself in bank

I also invest in crypto but that's just about 69$ , not planning on adding more to crypto (it's more of a gamble than an investment lol but I invest in good coins like solana and bitcoin and Ethereum + some meme coins like doge + ai coins like act)

Plan on adding to stocks and mf every month/week depending on how much I earn via freelancing (18.9 years age)

*Is tata motors something I should keep my eye on*

My main goal is to be smart and add on to this portfolio via increasing my income by upskilling myself and studying, all the while freelancing without hinderencing my academics much

1. In the MF space, continue SIPs in the Parag Parikh Fund but revisit the rationale behind selecting the other two funds.
2. Your stock portfolio is concentrated in high-risk, cyclical, and speculative stocks. Stocks make up \~10.5% of your portfolio, while mutual funds account for \~89.5%. 
3. Add some defensive stocks to balance risk.
4. Make sure you have an emergency fund and adequate insurance before allocating more to risky assets.",2025-02-01 05:21:51,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1iesv96/would_like_some_knowledge_and_criticism/,StockMarketIndia

2.thanks I didn't knew that it is high risk , I thought I had enough large cap but today after budget I bought tata motors and suzlon (I was in loss in suzlon so averaged it out)
3. What stocks would u suggest for balancing the risk? Relience? Kpit? Motilal fin?
4. I m a student but still kept a decent chunk in bank for peace of mind, idk about insurance, I think I have health insurance but it was made by my parents, and I plan on diversifying to other assets as well like gold and ppfas stuff and fd because as u said need some amount with safety , but after I have enough capital that it's worth diversifying so much

After a prolonged bull run, NTPC is now exhibiting signs of weakness and potential reversal. The stock has broken its support level and closed below it, signaling a bearish sentiment. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.

Additionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance.",2024-12-27 12:19:32,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hndpnu/should_i_exit_my_long_position_in_ntpc_bearish/,StockMarketIndia

I’ve been doing this for a decade. Separately, of course, I have a personal equity portfolio as well — in that, I have been investing ~40% of my capital based on momentum factor for the past couple of years and that has beat the broader market indices by a decent margin. 

Beginning today, in this thread, I’ll post top 10 stocks from Nifty50 which are currently experiencing high momentum. I’ll update this list on a weekly basis. 

If I see interest in these lists, I’ll post high momentum stocks from small- and mid-caps as well. I have a couple of smallcases as well (freely available) that are also based on momentum tracking. These have given 79% and 20% returns in the past 14 months and 4 months, respectively.

post,1k1wrs2,Oil prices have hit a 3-year low – is this a smart time to buy Indian oil companies?,The_wise_guy108,"I noticed that global crude oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in nearly three years. Naturally, that made me wonder — **could this be a good time to invest in Indian oil companies like HPCL, BPCL, or IOCL?**

post,1j3tzci,Crude oil looks to tank with rsi below 30,TechnoFundaAnalysis,"Multi-Tested Support Zone Weakening: Crude oil is testing a key support level multiple times, a zone that’s losing strength with each revisit, increasing the odds of a breakdown in INR terms.

Imminent Breakdown Risk: A drop below this critical support could trigger a sharp decline, aligning with global bearish cues and India’s sensitivity to oil price volatility.


RSI Signals Persistent Weakness: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is stuck at dismal levels, reflecting poor momentum and little hope for a sustained rebound in the near term.


Bounce Unlikely to Hold: With crude as long as its below $70 any uptick may lack conviction, facing resistance and keeping prices subdued.


Boost for Indian OMCs: A crude oil slump would lower import costs for companies like BPCL, HPCL, and IOC, potentially stabilizing retail fuel prices and improving refining margins.

Aviation Stocks Set to Soar: Falling oil prices could ease jet fuel costs for Indian carriers like IndiGo and SpiceJet, enhancing profitability amid high domestic demand.",2025-03-05 03:36:51,3.0,8.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1j3tzci/crude_oil_looks_to_tank_with_rsi_below_30/,IndianStreetBets

""company-name - your comments""

I have started analyzing bunch of companies from Dec 2024 and categorized them. The list of stocks below are categorized as ""Looks Good"" meaning they are baggers but has hope of really going up. 

This time, i have kept my analysis very simple, as everyone is concerned on Warren's Reserves(CASH) which is above $200b at the moment. So i have looked at these companies Sales, Profits and Reserves. For analysis, i have used [screener.in](http://screener.in/) as [moneycontrol.com](http://moneycontrol.com/) had too many ads.

post,1gkv991,TRUMP's WIN: A Double-Edged Sword?,kzarraja,"**Here's the good news!**

1. Increased tariffs on products coming in from the People’s Republic of China would increase the Market for Goods made in India.
2. Trump's Pro-Fossil Fuel Policies may result in a decline in International crude oil prices benefitting Indian Oil Companies such as BPCL, IOC, and HPCL.
3. The development of US industries may also lead to the emergence of more business opportunities in the US and India for some companies like ABB, Siemens, and Cummins.
4. A more stable global environment under Trump could streamline supply chains, benefiting Indian companies like HAL and Bharat Dynamics.
5. Business friendly measures especially cuts on taxes, lowering funding regulations and other policies to promote investment are some of the factors that induced the upward trend of the Indian equity market.

**That's not it, We've some Bad News too!**

1. An increase in interest rates in the US as well as reduced availability of cheap materials from the US supply base may cause inflation in India.
2. A rise in the dollar may weaken several emerging market currencies, the Indian rupee included.
3. Trump’s unpredictable policies might promote some level of instability in the market which may result in losses for Indian investors.
4. Already carried out restrictions on the issuance of H-1B visas restricted the growth of Indian IT companies and more of such policies can be anticipated in the future.
5. Trump’s comments on trade border measures by India may lead to aggravation of the current trade war with threats of even harsher measures.

post,1g4ux20,"Indian PSU Stocks – % Fall from Highs and Potential for Recovery
",altinvestindia,"Saw this table showing the performance of some well-known Indian PSU (Public Sector Undertaking) and related stocks, specifically highlighting how far they’ve fallen from their 52-week highs and how much they would need to rise to retest those highs.

Some Highlights :

* **Cochin Shipyard (COCHINSHIP)**: Down 43% from its high of ₹2912, it would need a 75% gain to retest that high.
* **MRPL**: Has seen a 40% decline and would need a 68% recovery to hit its previous high.
* **GRSE, HUDCO, ITI**: All showing falls of over 30%, with significant room for potential recovery (50-70%).

On the lower end:

* **NTPC, GAIL, BPCL**: These stocks are only down 4-6% and need relatively smaller recoveries (6-8%) to retest their highs

How many of you are stuck in these stocks and invested due to the hype and hoopla during the first half of the year.

You can have huge interest come into a sector “psu” and die for the sector to never reach the highs again. 

You are stating recovery goals with no bases on why it would be in that bracket or if the stock is undervalued - hence ending with a recovery to fair value.

post,1djeo4o,"Modi 3.0: Betting on political stability, policy continuity",Frosty-Rip3625,"
Summary: 

•	Most pre-election polls suggest a comfortable victory for the incumbent BJP government, maintaining its single party majority in the Lok Sabha for the third time in a row.

•	The incumbent government’s reforms have already started fructifying, as reflected in high GDP growth along with fiscal discipline and efficient capital allocation versus populist measures.

•	On the flipside, the worst-possible scenario could be the BJP not achieving a single party majority, wherein sentiments could take a beating on political stability and some knee-jerk reaction could be seen.

•	Modi 3.0 expect New Reform Rush: We expect a major structural reform rush in Modi 3.0, though the magnitude of the same would depend on numbers of seats won. In setting a roadmap for Viksit Bharat 2047, we anticipate major policy reforms for Ease of Doing Business to attract FDI investments and sovereign rating upgrades, driving higher flows into government bonds given t",2024-06-19 09:06:43,3.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1djeo4o/modi_30_betting_on_political_stability_policy/,IndianStreetBets
