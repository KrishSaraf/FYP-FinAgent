post,1jmgw56,Large-Cap Stocks (Nifty50): Technical Insights as We Wrap Up FY 2024-25,priteshpalan,"As we approach the end of the financial year, I took a look at the charts of some large-cap stocks (Nifty50). Sharing my observations below—not as calls to buy or sell, but as insights based on price action. Even after 20+ years of studying charts, I still consider myself a learner, and I believe the market always has something new to teach.

# Stock Observations:

🔹 **TATAMOTORS** – Weak unless it crosses & closes above **725**. Sell on rise otherwise.

🔹 **TCS** – Broken previous weekly low; break below 3457 with volume it could fall to **2744**.

🔹 **KOTAKBANK** – Broke out above **1980-2000**; any dip and re-test to this level may offer a **long-term buying opportunity**.

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

After a prolonged bull run, NTPC is now exhibiting signs of weakness and potential reversal. The stock has broken its support level and closed below it, signaling a bearish sentiment. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.

Additionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance.

post,1gkzbl2,Portfolio Review ,Correct_Fuel_942,"Hello, can someone please review my stock review?

1)ITC (10 Shares)-> I was interested in ITC for a long time and finally had some funds that I could invest for at least 3 years and forget about it.The price was also within my bearable range and I like their products. I also like dividends.I am also hoping to get the ITC Hotel share(1 share for every 10 ITC Stocks)

2)COALINDIA(4 shares) -> I was interested in a stock that paid steady dividends and want to hold this until I can recover my capital.I bought this before November 5(so will get the dividend that is going to paid out).This stock also had a somewhat okayish price for me and so I bought this.

3)IDFCFIRSTB(4 shares in total -> 1 purchased 3 more today) : I am related to some people who works in banks (not in IDFCFIRSTB or CANARA )and they suggested this and CANARA BANK. I am also somewhat hopeful in their CEO . I plan to buy 1 share of this bank weekly till 2025 June or till the stock price increases to 100 Rs whichever is sooner.

4)CANARA BANK(30 shares in total) : I was recommended this and the stock did pay good dividends.

5) Soon to be included -> plan to buy 100 shares of Federal Bank when the price cools down as I think someday the price will go lower and I do not have much funds now.

I also have a mutual fund where 500 rupees is deposited every month.

# I intend to not be an active investor and am interested in dividends.

1.  **Canara Bank (NSE: CANBK):** Stellar Q4 results! Net profit soared 33.19%, and the bank announced a 200% dividend (₹4/share). This indicates strong financial health.

If you see that BSR of the company is good, overall growth score is good and intrinsic value is higher than current market price than we decide hold or sell.

Additionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength.

5. Lastly if you are investing for longer periods then treat like that. Don't open and watch your portfolio everyday.

post,1f0bp58,Zerodha showing stocks pledged,lite_huskarl,"Hello everyone,

I noticed that both my parents zerodha account shows stocks pledged in holdings and this has not been done by them. Moreover, pledged quantity is more than what they hold. Interestingly, my zerodha account shows no such thing so it cannot be a glitch. None of us do intr day or future/options, only delivery based equity.

I remember some 15 years back India infoline did something similar to this when they pledged shares without explicit information and made some trades and lost money from my father's account. We had to take them to SEBI for partial recovery. I am worried zerodha is on same path. I am attaching the screenshot below. Pls help me make sense out of this. Have raised a ticket but there is trust deficit there given the past.

post,1kia0ze,Top 10 Market-Moving News for Indian Stocks (2025-05-09),ecofaille,"Here's a quick rundown of the top news that could impact Indian stock performance today:

1.  **Canara Bank (NSE: CANBK):** Stellar Q4 results! Net profit soared 33.19%, and the bank announced a 200% dividend (₹4/share). This indicates strong financial health.

3.  **Escorts Kubota (NSE: ESKUB):** FY25 standalone profit jumps 15.7%. The board recommended a final dividend of ₹18.0 per share. Positive outlook.

4.  **Kalyan Jewellers (NSE: KALYAN):** Strong FY25 results with 35% revenue growth. Exceeded ₹25,000 crore in revenue. Positive trend.

5.  **Lupin (NSE: LUPIN):** USFDA approval for generic Raltegravir tablets with 180-day exclusivity. This will help Lupin secure a good share of this market in the short term.

6.  **Coal India (NSE: COALINDIA):** Supplying 4500 MW renewable energy to AM Green in a landmark deal. A major step into renewable energy.

7.  **HCLTech (NSE: HCLTECH):** Partnering with Taylor Wimpey to modernize IT infrastructure, focusing on AI and digital transformation. This will positively impact the revenue of the company.
