post,1k7c5de,Frustrated with stock picking,SeekerFinder4,"I have been investing by picking stocks, doing research and holding them too since 2020. over the years invested about 20L. But i lately feeling frustrated with the amount of return I could see. its merely 35%.

I see ppl here posting about Mutual funds doubling their amount and I feel what is wrong am I doing. I know the market is still facing headwinds but I'm losing my faith and patience. I am thinking to exit scrips on 2x and invest in MF instead.

post,1fqdl1b,"Rev/iew my port/folio please, 28 , No background of investment, Self Made so far, Goal - 1cr before 30 ",rohit9967,"Hi Reddit Family,

A bit of context about myself:

I come from a humble background, without any financial inheritance or prior knowledge of investing. I’ve worked hard to support my family and am currently responsible for my parents and others close to me. At 28, Single and working full-time, I started investing around 2-3 years ago with no prior experience, learning through Reddit, YouTube, and books.

My focus is on long-term growth, with a goal of reaching 1cr before I turn 30. Achieving this would provide me with a sense of financial security and peace of mind.

Treat me someone who is eager to learn but lacking good network or friends to guide me through these decisions. Your advice would mean a lot to me.

Current status of my monthly investment :

* Nifty 50 SIP - Monthly (20k) 
* Nifty next 50 SIP - Monthly (20k) 
* Additional stocks investment - (10k)

Specifically, I would appreciate your thou/ghts on the following:

1. How do you eval/uate my current port/folio, and what improvements could I make?
2. What actions or strategies should I focus on to potentially reach 1cr before 30? Additionally, how much more investment would be necessary to achieve that goal, currently investing around \~50/month?
3. I will be receiving a bonus of approximately 8L next month, what would be the best strategy to invest it wisely?

Thank you for your time and expertise. Happy to hear your thou/ghts on how I can improve my approach and avoid common mistakes :)",2024-09-27 02:30:06,56.0,30.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fqdl1b/review_my_portfolio_please_28_no_background_of/,IndianStockMarket

I suggest you avoid chasing higher returns by taking unnecessary risks, like investing in penny stocks or derivatives for short-term gains. These can lead to significant losses over time. Instead, focus on consistently growing your capital. Regular investments in mutual funds, combined with a little exposure to stocks (if you understand them), can be a more sustainable way to create wealth. Aim for a 15-16% CAGR as your target rather than running after speculative returns.",2024-09-27 05:27:42,6.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fqdl1b/review_my_portfolio_please_28_no_background_of/,IndianStockMarket
