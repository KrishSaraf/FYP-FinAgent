post,1inm3uc,"Why OMC Companies Like HPCL, IOC, and BPCL Are a Bargain Buy",Full_Employment_9502,"

The share prices of OMCs have fallen significantly from their all-time highs, making their valuations very attractive.
These stocks are trading at lower P/E ratios compared to their historical averages and other high-growth sectors.
Crude Oil Outlook Favors OMCs

With Trump in power and his push to boost U.S. crude oil production, global oil prices are unlikely to surge.
A stable crude price range of $65-$75 will help OMCs maintain refining margins and reduce earnings volatility.
Under-Recoveries & Government Support

OMCs are currently facing under-recoveries on LPG sales, estimated at ₹30,000 crore.
The government has already provided ₹12,000 crore in subsidies, and additional support is expected, which will directly improve their financials.
Government Backing & Policy Support

The government holds a majority stake in all three OMCs, ensuring long-term stability and financial backing.
Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has been praising the financial performance of OMCs, signaling continued government confidence in the sector.
The disinvestment of BPCL was scrapped, indicating that the government sees growth potential in oil marketing companies.
High Dividend Yield – A Major Advantage

OMCs offer strong dividend yields of 6-9%, which are comparable to fixed deposit (FD) returns.
This makes them an attractive investment for long-term investors looking for stable returns along with potential capital appreciation.
Better Value Compared to Overvalued Stocks

Instead of chasing high P/E stocks like Zomato, Dixon, and Trent, investors should focus on OMCs, which offer a much better risk-reward ratio.
These stocks provide gradual wealth generation along with yearly dividends, making them a solid choice for long-term portfolios.",2025-02-12 08:04:24,28.0,28.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1inm3uc/why_omc_companies_like_hpcl_ioc_and_bpcl_are_a/,IndianStockMarket

post,1ip2vxn,US will announce list of tariffs on 1st April (countrywise) - Good news for short sellers,curioussharma-007,"https://preview.redd.it/dpq0dze8b1je1.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=8699538a109a1127c6749197786a0b44fb3e8d1e

  
Hey,,  
If you are into short selling like me (and making money in last 2 months), the good news is that US has announced reciprocal tariffs and it will share details on 1st April (country wise), India is already knows as 'Tariff king' as said by Trump.

As a short seller who use AI a lot, here's my research for possible shorting oppurtunity:

# Which Indian Sectors Are at Risk for Tariffs?

Given Trump's trade policies and focus on protecting American industries, these sectors are the most likely targets for tariffs:

# 1. Pharmaceuticals (Exports: $7.55 billion) – High Risk

* The U.S. imports a massive amount of **generic drugs** from India.
* Trump has pushed for **onshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing** in the U.S.
* **Likely action**: Higher tariffs on **generic medicines** from India to protect U.S. pharma firms.

# 2. Precious Metals & Stones (Exports: $10.17 billion) – Moderate-High Risk

* India is one of the biggest exporters of **cut and polished diamonds** to the U.S.
* Trump previously **increased tariffs on Chinese jewelry**; he may do the same to India.
* **Likely action**: Tariffs on **diamonds and jewelry** to promote local manufacturing.

# 3. Electrical & Electronic Equipment (Exports: $9.89 billion) – Moderate-High Risk

* Includes **Motherson Sumi, ABB India, and Exide Industries**.
* India exports **electronic components and auto electronics**, competing with U.S. firms.
* **Trump previously targeted China with tech-related tariffs.**
* **Likely action**: Import duties on **Indian auto electronics, semiconductors, and batteries**.

# 4. Automotive & Auto Parts (Exports: $2.58 billion) – Moderate Risk

* **Hero MotoCorp** and **Motherson Sumi** export motorcycles and auto components.
* Trump previously **imposed tariffs on European & Chinese auto imports**.
* **Likely action**: Tariffs on **Indian two-wheelers and auto components** to support U.S. manufacturers.

# 5. Textiles & Apparel (Exports: $2.64 billion) – Moderate Risk

* India is a **top textile and apparel exporter** to the U.S.
* Trump **previously imposed tariffs on China’s textile exports**.
* **Likely action**: Higher duties on **Indian garments** to boost U.S. production.

# 6. Oil & Petrochemicals (Exports: $6.52 billion) – Low-Moderate Risk

* **Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and ONGC** export refined petroleum to the U.S.
* The U.S. wants **energy independence**, so **tariffs on Indian oil** could be possible.
* **Likely action**: A tariff on **Indian refined oil products**, but impact may be low.

# 7. IT & Software Services (Not in the export goods list, but a huge sector) – Low Risk

* India dominates **IT services and outsourcing** for American companies.
* Instead of tariffs, Trump might **tighten visa rules (H-1B restrictions)**.

However, this is just one parameter, rest you can check in weekly which stocks are already going down and on daily check if they are over bought, this given oppurtunity to enter the market>

I am not against Indian market, I am just a trader who makes money on both sides and right now for this year I am highly bearish.

comment,1j1rnkw,,,,,,,mfmxduh,SubstantialRest7116,"### Portfolio Overview
You’ve invested in 14 assets: 12 individual stocks, 1 sectoral ETF (Nifty SBI ETF), and 1 gold ETF (Gold Bees). Total allocation sums to 100%, so I assume this is your full portfolio. Here’s the breakdown by sector/type based on your holdings:

- **Energy/PSUs**: NTPC (6.64%), NTPC Green (9.28%), ONGC (6.97%), IOC (4.81%), IRFC (5.56%) – **33.26%**
- **Finance**: SBI (7.66%), Manappuram (6.13%), Bajaj Housing Finance (2.55%) – **16.34%**
- **Pharma**: Dr. Reddy’s (5.82%), Natco Pharma (6.96%) – **12.78%**
- **Auto**: Tata Motors (9.41%) – **9.41%**
- **IT**: Wipro (7.23%) – **7.23%**
- **FMCG**: ITC (4.87%) – **4.87%**
- **ETFs**: Nifty SBI ETF (6.02%), Gold Bees (9.96%) – **15.98%**

**Key Observations**:
- Heavy PSU exposure (33.26%), especially energy-related (NTPC, ONGC, IOC, IRFC).
- Diversified across sectors, but concentrated in a few stocks (e.g., NTPC Green, Tata Motors, Gold Bees each ~9-10%).
- Current ETF allocation (Nifty SBI + Gold Bees) is ~16%, with intent to increase it.

### Performance Context: Down 20% Since July 2024
You started investing in July 2024, and as of March 2, 2025 (8 months later), you’re down 20%. Let’s contextualize this:
- **Market Trends (July 2024–March 2025)**: The Nifty 50, a broad market benchmark, grew ~5-7% in this period (based on historical trends and assuming no major crash by March 2025). However, midcaps, smallcaps, and PSUs (where you’re heavily invested) saw volatility—some PSU stocks corrected 15-25% after a 2023-early 2024 rally.
- **Your Portfolio**: A 20% loss suggests your picks underperformed the broader market, likely due to sector-specific declines or stock selection.

**Is This Normal?**: For a beginner starting mid-2024:
- Yes, it’s possible. Markets don’t always go up, and 2024 saw profit booking in PSU and midcap stocks after a multi-year bull run.
- No, it’s not ideal. A 20% drop against a flat-to-up broader market indicates some stock-specific or allocation issues.

**Red Flags**:
- **Wipro**: IT sector faced headwinds in 2024 (US slowdown, fewer contracts). Fundamentally weaker than peers.
- **PSU Overweight (IRFC, NTPC, ONGC, IOC)**: 2024 saw PSU profit-taking after a 2023 boom—your timing might’ve coincided with this.
- No glaring “wrong” stocks, but high exposure to volatile PSUs and midcaps likely amplified your loss.


- **Current Volatility**: 
  - PSU-heavy (33%) and midcaps (e.g., Manappuram, Natco) are volatile—20% drop reflects this.
  - Gold Bees (10%) and Nifty SBI ETF (6%) are stabilizers, but 16% isn’t enough to offset stock-specific risk.
- **Plan to Increase Nifty ETF & Gold**:
  - **Nifty ETF**: Tracks Nifty 50, low volatility (~15-20% annualized), diversified across sectors. Increasing this (e.g., to 15-20%) balances your PSU tilt.
  - **Gold**: Low correlation to stocks, hedges inflation. Boosting to 15% (from 10%) makes sense—gold’s uptrend in 2024 supports this.
- **Suggestion**: Trim high-risk stocks (e.g., NTPC Green, Tata Motors—your 9%+ bets) to fund ETFs. Aim for 20% Nifty ETF + 15% Gold (35% low-volatility assets).

### My View on Your Portfolio
- **Strengths**: Decent diversification (energy, finance, pharma, etc.), some defensive picks (ITC, Gold), PSU exposure taps government growth themes.
- **Weaknesses**: 
  - Overweight PSUs (33%) at a volatile time—your 20% loss likely stems from this correction.
  - High single-stock bets (9-10% in Tata Motors, NTPC Green) amplify risk for a beginner.
  - Wipro’s underperformance is a weak link.
- **Is Something Wrong?**: Not fundamentally—your stocks aren’t “bad” picks. The issue is timing (bought at peaks?) and allocation (too much in volatile segments).
- **Normalcy**: A 20% drop in 8 months isn’t rare for a stock-heavy portfolio in a corrective phase, but it’s steeper than the market—adjustments can help.


### Recommendations
1. **Rebalance**:
   - Reduce NTPC Green, Tata Motors to 5-6% each.
   - Exit or trim Wipro (swap for a stronger IT stock like Infosys if you want IT).
   - Boost Nifty ETF to 15-20% and Gold Bees to 15%.
2. **Hold Steady**: ITC, Dr. Reddy’s, SBI, ONGC are solid—don’t panic-sell losses.
3. **Learn Timing**: Use SIPs for ETFs to avoid buying at peaks.
4. **Review**: Check your cost price vs. March 2025 levels—share specifics if you want deeper analysis.",2025-03-02 17:32:07,9.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1j1rnkw/would_love_to_hear_your_views_on_my_portfolio/,IndianStockMarket

post,1iwujjv,"So market did what we discussed on Friday (gap down and on trajectory), moving on...",curioussharma-007,"Hey traders,

As discussed in this post:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ivcquh/worst\_fall\_of\_2025\_friday\_in\_us\_market\_and\_whats/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ivcquh/worst_fall_of_2025_friday_in_us_market_and_whats/)

Market did as expected in terms of 700 points fall in US DOW on Friday, making it biggest single day fall of 2025 in US market and we discussed how this will impact Indian stock exchange and how as a trader we can monetize it in short terms via buying put or shorting futures.

As of 10:48 morning, NIFTY50 is 1% down and my positions are:

Point of showing this kind of screenshot is to motivate traders who have lost money in last 4-5 months to understand the process of shorting. I am not some kind of seller rather a fellow trader who want to build a community who can make money on both sides of trade instead getting emotionally attached to bull/bear side.

Shorting is 'smaller' event in trading and next potential shorting event is 2nd April.

post,1dw2kvl,Kotak predicts a bleak future for Oil & Gas stocks. What's your take on it?,sandymartin07,"Recently, Kotak Institutional Equities suggested a 'Sell' rating on oil & gas stocks like IOC, BPCL, HPCL, GAIL, Oil India, and Petronet LNG, citing diminishing prospects of future growth beyond a limit. What do you make of it? I myself have fair exposure to some of these stocks and believe the energy & power sector isn't going to die out soon. Recently, they also had similar verdicts about Titan and Lupin, and the shares saw substantial movement the next day.

What is your opinion? Doesn't it look like these firms try to influence the market in some way?

Companies like IOCL, BPCL, HPCL etc are downstream oil companies. They buy crude oil from upstream companies, either domestic or foreign, refine it within their refineries, then transport the oil from their refineries to fuel stations all across the country.

Regarding the petrol/diesel price staying stable, that's by design.

Should I sell off the 4 mentioned stocks and book profits since they have given a decent return. PVR has given 20% in like 1.5 months.

post,1g9nizu,Planning to take 10L loan for long term( Oct - Dec time investment),rohit9967,"Hi Reddit family,

With the market trending down, I'm considering some promising stocks such as Tata Motors, CDSL, Bajaj Housing Finance, Castrol, TCS, ONGC, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Steel, UltraTech Cement, Reliance, Tata Tech, Tata Consumer Products, Britannia, Titan, IEX, Coal India, BEL, IOC, and Nifty ETFs.

These are potential stocks and indices I’m looking at, but I plan to narrow it down to just 10 for investment (mostly focusing on Tata stocks).

I’ve been investing for the long term over the past few years and am not in a rush to withdraw the invested money, as it’s meant solely for investment (longer than 5+ years) Additionally, I can manage to pay off my loan in a few months (maximum 4-5 months).

I would appreciate your guidance on whether this is a good decision and any advice or suggestions you might have. 

I’m planning to invest between October and December, and I intend to hold some investments until the U.S. election period and results. What are your thoughts on this? Kindly guide me.

After a prolonged bull run, NTPC is now exhibiting signs of weakness and potential reversal. The stock has broken its support level and closed below it, signaling a bearish sentiment. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.

Additionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance.

post,1eqm9rf,Top 10 Dividend paying stocks ,FlatwormOptimal5521,"  
 

# Top 10 Dividend paying stocks 

Dividend-paying stocks are shares of companies that distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders at regular intervals, typically quarterly. 

These dividends can provide a reliable source of income, making them attractive to investors seeking steady returns, such as retirees or those looking for stability.

Dividends are paid out of a company’s earnings and are usually expressed as a cash amount per share or additional shares of stock.

This did work for some time until now. 

Now he wants me to invest according to his will in one particular stock every month. I dont mind it as the stock is good. 

But i want to do it according to me and my stocks have my stocks have good returns but idk why he doesn’t trust me. I need help convincing him for the same.

Take this as goal of over the period of 3-4 months. Just focus on your increasing your  knowledge parallely about stock markets and investing and try to have as many conversations with your dad as possible. Calmly talk to him what he has to say, lot of times they just want their kids to listen to them and show that how much knowledge they have and also some validations. In between with the time make some smart points about the stocks and all as per your knowledge, as will follow this for some time, they will definitely notice that you are also having some knowledge around it and its okay to let you handle some things. And let me tell you, they also don’t want to handle all of this by themselves, after all we have enough of stress to manage from other things in life. And most importantly, take a deep breath and try to keep yourself positive in these situations, the more good you will feel, the better you will be able to communicate. And at first try to make it like a collaboration first and then slowly build your presence in front of your father and eventually dominance with time.

It has increased significantly in last 2 years hence, Value is much higher because big players already bought ling time ago.
It's not among top 5 in the industry yet, so no on that side too.
It gives dividend.... yield is 2%.
By checking roce roe and all from above I would say it's a good buy around 42 and then best is at 32.
for value investing, dividend yield will also be good.

It may go up from here but it's not that attractive.

If I check in the industry, PNB seems much better choice than this... that too around 80-90 price..... best price to enter for long term is 48.... at this point of time... however it may change in future when it reaches at that price.

After a prolonged bull run, NTPC is now exhibiting signs of weakness and potential reversal. The stock has broken its support level and closed below it, signaling a bearish sentiment. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.

Additionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance.",2024-12-27 12:19:32,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hndpnu/should_i_exit_my_long_position_in_ntpc_bearish/,StockMarketIndia

Started in July 2024, That time I have no knowledge of stocks, bought IRFC and SAIL on friends recommendation and then Bajaj Housing due to Hype !

Now, I have done some research and have some knowledge,

Added Kfin Tech, Ashoka Buildcon, Wipro and IOC(mainly for dividend).

Thinking of selling SAIL and IRFC, will book my loss just waiting for them to go up to minimize my loss.

post,1j3tzci,Crude oil looks to tank with rsi below 30,TechnoFundaAnalysis,"Multi-Tested Support Zone Weakening: Crude oil is testing a key support level multiple times, a zone that’s losing strength with each revisit, increasing the odds of a breakdown in INR terms.

Imminent Breakdown Risk: A drop below this critical support could trigger a sharp decline, aligning with global bearish cues and India’s sensitivity to oil price volatility.


RSI Signals Persistent Weakness: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is stuck at dismal levels, reflecting poor momentum and little hope for a sustained rebound in the near term.


Bounce Unlikely to Hold: With crude as long as its below $70 any uptick may lack conviction, facing resistance and keeping prices subdued.


Boost for Indian OMCs: A crude oil slump would lower import costs for companies like BPCL, HPCL, and IOC, potentially stabilizing retail fuel prices and improving refining margins.

Aviation Stocks Set to Soar: Falling oil prices could ease jet fuel costs for Indian carriers like IndiGo and SpiceJet, enhancing profitability amid high domestic demand.",2025-03-05 03:36:51,3.0,8.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1j3tzci/crude_oil_looks_to_tank_with_rsi_below_30/,IndianStreetBets

post,1g9nmbk,Planning to take 10L loan for long term( Oct - Dec time investment),rohit9967,"Hi Reddit family,

With the market trending down, I'm considering some promising stocks such as Tata Motors, CDSL, Bajaj Housing Finance, Castrol, TCS, ONGC, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Steel, UltraTech Cement, Reliance, Tata Tech, Tata Consumer Products, Britannia, Titan, IEX, Coal India, BEL, IOC, and Nifty ETFs.

These are potential stocks and indices I’m looking at, but I plan to narrow it down to just 10 for investment (mostly focusing on Tata stocks).

I’ve been investing for the long term over the past few years and am not in a rush to withdraw the invested money, as it’s meant solely for investment. Additionally, I can manage to pay off my loan in a few months (maximum 4-5 months).

I would appreciate your guidance on whether this is a good decision and any advice or suggestions you might have. 


I’m planning to invest between October and December, and I intend to hold some investments until the U.S. election period and results. What are your thoughts on this? Kindly guide me.

post,1gkv991,TRUMP's WIN: A Double-Edged Sword?,kzarraja,"**Here's the good news!**

1. Increased tariffs on products coming in from the People’s Republic of China would increase the Market for Goods made in India.
2. Trump's Pro-Fossil Fuel Policies may result in a decline in International crude oil prices benefitting Indian Oil Companies such as BPCL, IOC, and HPCL.
3. The development of US industries may also lead to the emergence of more business opportunities in the US and India for some companies like ABB, Siemens, and Cummins.
4. A more stable global environment under Trump could streamline supply chains, benefiting Indian companies like HAL and Bharat Dynamics.
5. Business friendly measures especially cuts on taxes, lowering funding regulations and other policies to promote investment are some of the factors that induced the upward trend of the Indian equity market.

**That's not it, We've some Bad News too!**

1. An increase in interest rates in the US as well as reduced availability of cheap materials from the US supply base may cause inflation in India.
2. A rise in the dollar may weaken several emerging market currencies, the Indian rupee included.
3. Trump’s unpredictable policies might promote some level of instability in the market which may result in losses for Indian investors.
4. Already carried out restrictions on the issuance of H-1B visas restricted the growth of Indian IT companies and more of such policies can be anticipated in the future.
5. Trump’s comments on trade border measures by India may lead to aggravation of the current trade war with threats of even harsher measures.
