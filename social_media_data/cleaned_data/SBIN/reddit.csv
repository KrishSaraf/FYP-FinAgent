post,1gtiern,Portfolio review please,dreamer0910,"Background: Till about 1 year ago, I would have referred to myself as a super-diversified hardcore value conscious defensive investor. Still would call myself that but have taken positions in some not-large-cap companies in the last 1 year.

I have 75 stocks in my portfolio but have include 42 in the screenshot below with a sizeable position > 75k

https://preview.redd.it/xgaatvhmth1e1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=35045a22f776a0cac3c1bff5137565b6fdd7a356

Rationale for the top holdings

1. HDFC Bank: Biggest private sector bank with a focus on retail and growing in Tier-2/3 cities. We are 1 stock market crash away from HDFC Bank rallying. Irony?
2. Angel One: Growing the second fastest in brokers. Fairly valued as compared to Groww but overvalued as compare to Zerodha. Reference Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gb1r0m/want\_to\_go\_yolo\_on\_angel\_one/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gb1r0m/want_to_go_yolo_on_angel_one/)
3. INFY/HCL/Wipro: Most of my positions are more than 2 years old. Now, you can call it Betting on Trump
4. IRFC: Got lucky. Bought at a decent valuation when the stock was 25. Sold 1/3 position at 125 and still hold the remaining 2/3 of the position. Will let it play out because if India needs to move at scale, railways need to be better and more common. Railways get their funding from IRFC.
5. Amara Raja: Betting on a reputed battery company with the most reliable battery brand (Amron). Bought it at decent valuations around 2 years back
6. Divis/Dr. Reddy/NH/Lal Pathlabs: Consumer companies in an economy where focus on healthcare is expected to grow

Also can you please suggest which stocks in my portfolio could be adjusted?

I am contemplating about HUL and Nestle as they seem to be fairly priced now at the same time renewable energy and EV sectors will be next big things in India in coming future.

However you’ll have to build a database to store all of that data. And also build your own back testing algorithm from scratch. Really not worth it trust me.

post,1foy8g9,Buy multiple stocks but low quantity or single stock but higher quantity ? ,Username6ixty9ine,"Hi all, I have been investing in stock market as a student since 2021. 3 months ago, I got a job and now I am investing around 40k every month. I know people talk about diversifying your portfolio, and also it's best to buy a significant quantity of a stock for optimal gains. Should I buy multiple stocks lets say 3 stocks for 15k each or should I buy maybe a single one for 30k and maybe something else for 15k. 

I have tata motors, ongc, sbin, and bandhan bank in my portfolio. But the portfolio itself is just 1.2 lakhs as of now. Bought tata motors at 960, bandhan bank at 202, ONGC at 290 and SBIN at 785. Portfolio is in profit but I wonder, if I would be adding more into these stocks in the future or invest in new ones. 

It would be great help if anyone could share some advice. ",2024-09-25 06:48:13,12.0,20.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1foy8g9/buy_multiple_stocks_but_low_quantity_or_single/,IndianStockMarket

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

This is not volume delta. Volume delta columns are different from it. This is something else that i could not find. 

Is it volume indicator or something else. Do you know? Please tell if you know.

I do not have paid subscription of this website. I took this screenshot from YouTube video.

post,1fyv6r2,Intraday Strategy - Inputs requested.,DirtNecessary8065,"Hello fellow traders,

I'm new to intraday trading and have developed a strategy using EMAs (5, 10), as shown in the Pine Script code below. I would appreciate your feedback on it. When I test the strategy in TradingView's Strategy Tester, it delivers exceptional results for certain stocks (e.g., SBIN, as shown below). However, I'm unsure about the long-term viability of the strategy. Could I be interpreting something incorrectly? I would greatly appreciate your insights.

post,1dlx8pc,Portfolio Review and Investment Advice for the Future for a Newbie Investor,esem29,"(Warning: Long Post)

I'm 22 M, graduated college recently, and I've recently started to learn about the Stock Market and Mutual Funds. I learned Fundamental Analysis using Zerodha Varsity, and I'm also constantly reading up on investment basics, strategies, considerations, etc.

My parents are financially very strong, and gave me 12L to put in mutual funds (I will eventually pay the 12L back). After discussing with a friend of theirs who works at Nuvama Investments, I have invested this amount in a mixture of large, mid, and Flexicap funds and some debt funds. I'm expecting good returns from them in the next 3-5 years.

Now, I had around 2.4 L left from a mixture of my internship savings and the money left in my account for my college expenses). My parents encouraged me to start investing in stocks, given I had already done a bit of research. 

I used Screener to filter out some stocks for the long term using some metrics, then did some research on the company to find out the current market and investor sentiment before finally investing in it. I have also identified the major sectors that are going to grow in the next 5 years: Infra, PSU Banks, Defence, Railways, and Oil and Gas. Based on all this,  this is my portfolio right now:

https://preview.redd.it/6ma5z40ix48d1.png?width=1267&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f9ef46d6151deee483f35aa62529ad8153323ae

HAL, BEL, and other Defense stocks seemed to be on a bullish run, and the sentiment about Defense stocks was that they were going to increase a lot. But HAL and BEL dropped a lot these past two days, and what doesn't help is that I've been seeing a lot of news recently about the markets being at an all-time high and some impending corrections coming soon. I was planning to invest in other Defense stocks as well (MAZDOCK, Cochin shipyard, and Paras Defense) but I'm not sure whether right now is a good time to enter these. 

I would love to hear some advice about my portfolio in general. I plan to hold most of them for the long term (3-5 years). I think I have bought too much SBI, I plan to sell half of it at a profit and invest in some other stocks. Some stocks on my watchlist are Railway (IRFC, IRCON, and RVNL), Sun Pharma (Very Strong Financials for the Long Term), and Tata Motors (I've seen People Recommend this stock a lot).

I would love to hear your thoughts on these. Also, I'll start earning soon (around \~1.4L per month post taxes) and I plan to also invest a bit in small-cap MFs, some Debt Instruments, and FDs. I live at home and have negligible monthly expenses, so I'm planning to invest most of my monthly income.

Now, I have some doubts regarding my portfolio:

1. **Is my MF portfolio good?**

I started with 5 SIPs based on my research but kept adding more whenever I found something interesting. Recently, friends advised that having too many MF SIPs can be problematic. They mentioned that the investment amount shouldn't change, but the number of MFs should be fewer. I didn't fully understand this. Are they right? If so, why? Also, if I need to reduce the number of MFs, which SIPs should I keep and which should I let go?

2. **Should I invest less in SIPs and more in stocks?**

I'm 29, and my friends say my risk appetite is higher. However, I prefer long-term investments and don't have the time or expertise to buy/sell stocks regularly. Am I making a mistake by focusing more on SIPs? Should I allocate more to stocks?

3. **Should I consider an SWP?**

4. I have 10 lacs to invest now. Any suggestions on how to allocate this based on my current portfolio?

Sorry for the many questions, but I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!",2024-06-27 05:22:34,3.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1dpjl0b/seeking_advice_on_my_investment_portfolio/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1dpjl0b,,,,,,,lahef35,Individual_Zombie_85,"1. Yeah I think you have way too many MF's. You can reduce it to 4-5 funds max. Please check the overlap between the different funds. I don't think multiple ELSS Tax Saver funds are required. Just keep 1 from each category. The reason for not keeping multiple MF's is, different expense ratios can keep eating into your profits.
2. If you don't have time to analyse and buy/sell stocks, you can continue with your SIP, no problem in that. You mentioned that you are picking stocks based on your friend's suggestions, and that can go horribly wrong. It's your life and your financial goals, so you can take the call about which way you want to go. Nothing wrong with either.",2024-06-27 05:54:28,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1dpjl0b/seeking_advice_on_my_investment_portfolio/,IndianStockMarket

Hey folks,

Just spotted a compelling setup on State Bank of India (NSE: SBIN) that I wanted to share. 📈


---

📊 Chart Snapshot

Current Price: ₹797.45

Breakout Level: ~₹780

Target: ₹880

Stop‑Loss: ₹766



🔍 Why I’m Bullish

1. Multi‑month Resistance: SBIN has been grinding under the ₹780–₹785 zone since February, forming a clear horizontal ceiling.


2. Volume Confirmation: The recent uptick on the breakout candle suggests strong buyer participation.


3. Risk/Reward: Riding from entry (~₹785–790) up to ₹880 offers ~12% upside vs. ~2.5% risk if stopped out at ₹766.




---

⚙️ Trade Plan

Entry: Any close above ₹780–785

Stop‑Loss: ₹766 (just below recent swing lows)

Target: ₹880 (projected measured move from breakout height)



---

❓ Thoughts & Feedback?

Do you see any overhead hurdles around ₹820–830?

Is my SL placement too tight for your taste?

Alternative targets or adjustments you’d consider?


Would love to hear your take before pulling the trigger. Let’s discuss! 👇

comment,1ij1j95,,,,,,,mba66vk,ZestycloseJudgment89,"SBIN stock appears weak from a technical perspective. It is trading below trendline support and the 40-day EMA. After breaking the support, the stock has been consolidating and forming a flag-and-pole-like pattern on the daily chart, which is a trend continuation pattern. If it breaks the support of this pattern, further downside is likely. The RMI has not yet given a sell signal, but it is on the verge of a bearish crossover. Looking at the open interest (OI) buildup, market sentiment also appears negative. Since December 2024, the market has been driven down by heavy short positions. Now, with OI increasing again alongside a decline in price, fresh short buildup is evident. If SBIN's Q3 results are negative, it would align with the price action and could push the stock even lower.

comment,1hrqodi,,,,,,,m5234oc,SuperbPercentage8050,"INDIA MART THE BUSINESS MODEL IS AMAZING you just purchased at wrong valuations and overpay, its a compounding machine if you hold for long term.

Alkyl amines is a commodity company and lacks pricing power so get rid of it because its still trading at 54 PE and Saurabh Mukherjee marketed this company at ridiculous valuations.

Yes bank just sell, if you want banking then stock with Kotak and HDFC Bank. they are high quality available at decent valuations

SBI you can expect anything between 10-12% returns based on their moat and growth rates.The negative tailwind is psi management and the past bank rally euphoria is over.

Arctic long term is good but you overpaid on this one again. You dont make money for 2-4 years if you pay high multiples of 60-70 even if earnings are compounding at decent pace because of mean reversion and pe compression. Arctic fundamentals are growing but the pe is compressing.

Cochin just get rid of it because the growth of next 5 years is already factored in the stock and a compression on multiple can drag it down 20-40%

asian paints long term is fine, but dont average it before the multiples reaches on 30-35 range, its still expensive given the slowdown in consumption and the pace at which its growing.

JIO 100 PE, you wont make  money on such multiples, and margin of safety is zero, one bad execution or news and you can see the stock crashing.,

Sail Is shit company just get out of it and allocate to high quality compounders.

Sharda motors is growing earnings and the valuations are not expensive so you can hold that one. 

Adani Wilmar, well the revenue have remain stagnant for past 4 years and increase in profit was due to financial act of increasing the other income.Its not a high quality company plus there margin profile is weak. Move to better companies who's management you can trust, plus always look at margin profile.

  
If you want any further help you can DM. 

Always screen your stocks through a high quality checklist before investing and never overpay.

One basic issue with your portfolio is that you overpaid for growth and purchased most of stock at 60-80PE, you must have probably came during covid and don't have basic understanding about how markets will behave in long term and how mean reversion destroys wealth.",2025-01-02 19:42:11,6.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hrqodi/should_i_exit_or_increase_holding_if_exit_how_to/,StockMarketIndia
comment,1hrqodi,,,,,,,m524j5o,SuperbPercentage8050,"Well the business is good and eps is growing, you overpaid at 60-80 PE. If you will overpay and buy stocks at such valuations you will have to see negative returns and waiting period of 3-5 years. 

India mart is also going through same stages, 

since 2021 EPS has almost moved up 100%, but because the PE compressed from 100 to 30 you are seeing negative returns.

long term its a compounding high quality business, but 100PE any stock cannot sustain for long and they will revert to mean. same happened with asian paints and will happen with all the stocks trading at ridiculous valuations and growing earnings at 10-15%.

Alkyl Amines is a commodity business and lack pricing power, Saurabh mukhaejea marketed it and people went for it at 100-120 PE. 

so its a learning lesson.

comment,1g15abi,,,,,,,lrdwkmy,HungrySwitch3524,"1. I have never actually liked companies having a business module as that of Zomato because they are always going to be a loss making company. So in terms of value investing, not a good bet as the debt will only increase if they wish to sustain. Anyway, you might be having your own philosophy, so good luck with that.

2. SBI is a good and safe bet. It'll fetch u dividend and safe returns to just beat inflation. You however will have to keep your expectations low from SBI in terms of returns.

3. No idea about SEPC but seems to create a good balance as one should have a small cap/mid cap in order to create a fortune. How big the companies in which you get early get decides the fortune you'll make hence have midcap/smallcaps from relevant sectors.

post,1fyv7p6,Intraday Strategy - Inputs requested.,DirtNecessary8065,"Hello fellow traders,

I'm new to intraday trading and have developed a strategy using EMAs (5, 10), as shown in the Pine Script code below. I would appreciate your feedback on it. When I test the strategy in TradingView's Strategy Tester, it delivers exceptional results for certain stocks (e.g., SBIN, as shown below). However, I'm unsure about the long-term viability of the strategy. Could I be interpreting something incorrectly? I would greatly appreciate your insights.

post,1keqcn4,"SBIN's Q4 results! 10% profit dip but solid dividend. What about SBIN's opening tomorrow: Gap up, down, or sideways?",The_Market_Maven,"Net profit dropped 10% in the Jan-March quarter (₹18,643 crore vs ₹20,698 crore last year). Consolidated profit also down 8% to ₹19,600 crore.

Here's the good part:  
1. Income jumped to ₹1.43 lakh crore (standalone) and ₹1.79 lakh crore (consolidated).  
2. They're giving a dividend of ₹15.90/ share.  
3. Full year profit up 16% to ₹70,901 crore (that's the big picture).  
4. Bad loans (NPAs) down significantly: gross NPAs at 1.82% (from 2.24%) and net NPAs at 0.47%

So what does this mean? SBI had one slightly weaker quarter but their yearly performance is strong. The asset quality improvement is a BIG deal, the bank is getting healthier.

Here is what I think. 

Daily chart has Inverse H&S pattern. Price moved above the neckline indicating the breakout of pattern. 

I am expecting to reach 840 as first target where it faces resistance. If we can break that trendline and hold, then we can see it going towards 860 where it faces another resistance(looking at left on chart shows you candles rejecting this level). If we can sustain above 860 then 900 we go. 

Trade plan needs to be revised based on stock reaction at those levels.",2025-04-18 13:23:53,1.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1k1juyb/whats_your_opinion_on_this_analysis_what_can_be/,IndianStreetBets

comment,1ij1lwz,,,,,,,mba6s45,ZestycloseJudgment89,"SBIN stock appears weak from a technical perspective. It is trading below trendline support and the 40-day EMA. After breaking the support, the stock has been consolidating and forming a flag-and-pole-like pattern on the daily chart, which is a trend continuation pattern. If it breaks the support of this pattern, further downside is likely. The RMI has not yet given a sell signal, but it is on the verge of a bearish crossover. Looking at the open interest (OI) buildup, market sentiment also appears negative. Since December 2024, the market has been driven down by heavy short positions. Now, with OI increasing again alongside a decline in price, fresh short buildup is evident. If SBIN's Q3 results are negative, it would align with the price action and could push the stock even lower.

Include reasons why you chose this trade so that new traders can learn. **If the reason for the trade is not mentioned your post will be removed**. Your reason can be as simple as: 'Went long on XYZ FUT because it was near support and had good volumes'. Not sure which flair to use?

post,1fre4dr,Where do we go now?,aman2992,"Portfolio update: Invested barely 60k over last 5 months vs an average investment run rate of 40k per month over last ~7 years. Portfolio value grew by almost 10L nonetheless. Basis experience so far in the markets, can't find value anywhere currently. Holding 2.5L in cash for any correction.

Right move at this point seems to diversify away from equities. However, overall debt portfolio also is sizeable and it doesn't seem wise to add to it considering taxes and inflation. Hence have zeroed down on land or real estate as the next investment vehicle. However, ticket size is huge, which is why I feel I am caught in a long waiting game.

Medium term strategy for equities is to keep building the cash position waiting for prices to cool down (US elections, interest rate move maybe) and to build a safety shell around equity portfolio so that it needn't be touched and can keep growing at whatever rate.
