Why I am saying that Tata motor will be good stock to buy is because TM have very stable financials with stable ownership, 3 year Sales growth & Profit growth is 20.58% & 64.4% Respectively. 

3 year ROE & ROCE is also around 10%. 

You can analyse all this company by yourself so that you can get a good idea about all this companies. I Personally use Finology TICKER for all my research work it is very useful for research work and very simple & easy to use. I would highly suggest you to give a try once.

post,1fqdl1b,"Rev/iew my port/folio please, 28 , No background of investment, Self Made so far, Goal - 1cr before 30 ",rohit9967,"Hi Reddit Family,

A bit of context about myself:

I come from a humble background, without any financial inheritance or prior knowledge of investing. I’ve worked hard to support my family and am currently responsible for my parents and others close to me. At 28, Single and working full-time, I started investing around 2-3 years ago with no prior experience, learning through Reddit, YouTube, and books.

My focus is on long-term growth, with a goal of reaching 1cr before I turn 30. Achieving this would provide me with a sense of financial security and peace of mind.

Treat me someone who is eager to learn but lacking good network or friends to guide me through these decisions. Your advice would mean a lot to me.

Current status of my monthly investment :

* Nifty 50 SIP - Monthly (20k) 
* Nifty next 50 SIP - Monthly (20k) 
* Additional stocks investment - (10k)

Specifically, I would appreciate your thou/ghts on the following:

https://preview.redd.it/e16bz91ij9rd1.png?width=2396&format=png&auto=webp&s=4334e3b3534e987a3f6dfd43a79276fe249d52dd

1. How do you eval/uate my current port/folio, and what improvements could I make?
2. What actions or strategies should I focus on to potentially reach 1cr before 30? Additionally, how much more investment would be necessary to achieve that goal, currently investing around \~50/month?
3. I will be receiving a bonus of approximately 8L next month, what would be the best strategy to invest it wisely?

Thank you for your time and expertise. Happy to hear your thou/ghts on how I can improve my approach and avoid common mistakes :)",2024-09-27 02:30:06,52.0,30.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fqdl1b/review_my_portfolio_please_28_no_background_of/,IndianStockMarket

I suggest you avoid chasing higher returns by taking unnecessary risks, like investing in penny stocks or derivatives for short-term gains. These can lead to significant losses over time. Instead, focus on consistently growing your capital. Regular investments in mutual funds, combined with a little exposure to stocks (if you understand them), can be a more sustainable way to create wealth. Aim for a 15-16% CAGR as your target rather than running after speculative returns.",2024-09-27 05:27:42,6.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fqdl1b/review_my_portfolio_please_28_no_background_of/,IndianStockMarket

post,1hif71i,"i know it's over diversified and the portfolio is shit, but i need suggestions",mannoshot,"[This portfolio has a story better than Pushpa 2 lol. So half of the stocks were suggested by a random dude on instagram and idk how but 99&#37; of the time, his suggestions were spot on. Apparently he was part of a trading company. I made crazy gains thru him, but I deleted my instagram account out of some personal reasons. After that I decided to start my own research and few of the stocks are result of my research. My first bet was Zomato which went really really well. So instead of consolidating the existing companies, I started buying new shares. I agree this was a dumb decision. Then I got busy in my exams and didn't have much time to research. So I bought shares just on the company's name. Some of these shares are Mahindra Logistics, Paras, Exide Industries, TVS Supply Chain and others. As you can see, most of them did decently well. Then I applied for Hyundai IPO with literally zero research. I thought since it's a big IPO of a big company, it'll eventually go up. I know, again a dumb decision, but here we are. Now the problem is, I can't figure out which ones to hold and which one to sell. As of now, I don't have time to research all of them. I will start studying finance & stock market soon, as it is included in my syllabus, but it'll start after 4-5 months. Until then I wanted a starting point regarding my portfolio. Those who have experience, what are the immediate red flags you've noticed? What suggestions do you have for me?\(other than to learn stock market lol\) Also, this is just 66&#37; of my total portfolio. The rest 34&#37; is in mutual funds with XIRR of 20.40&#37;.

Been in market for a year now and lately adding more funds.

no complaints with the results till now, with returns around 20%. But Ig there is lot more I can improve. not looking to sell anything anytime soon,

Reasoning behind these picks

Brought hdfc during dip ntg much to it.

NCC is cus m very bullish on Roads, National Highways, bridges and other infra as govt is focusing on this sector more than before.

HCLTech was my first big bet, ik tcs was a great option as well but I believe opportunity in hcl is much better. A year ago Infosys Wipro were not in my probables. now I see Infosys doing fine but I would still like to stick to HCLTech.

Tata Steel is my alltime favorite, I see it at 400+ range is 5 years or soo.

I'm debating between ambuja and ultratech cement now sure of wt to choose as well.

would like to know your views. any suggestions are welcomed.😇",2024-08-31 19:26:39,22.0,23.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1f5vbsm/completed_a_year_in_market_suggestions_are/,IndianStockMarket

comment,1f5vbsm,,,,,,,ll00sw1,None,"Hi man, good you have invested and made returns too. Here are some suggestions from my side, don't be disheartened or offended. I am giving these in your best interest only and since I've gone through this phase i can probably give more sensible advice  
1- Ncc- it's a okay share. ROE on lower side, but main thing is what theme are you betting on. You mentioned you are bullish on infra. From past experiences it is seen that during bull markets infra, real estate shares make highs and do well but during bear markets everyone forget such shares. This theme has never fascinated my personally, and I do not fall for this theory that ""India ko develop hona hai toh infra toh badhega hi"" that is a hollow statement and many imp stats are ignored while saying this. Still if you have studied the theme enough and bullish on it then keep up with it. Other financial ratios seem to be fine in this share.   
2- HCLTech - Large cap IT. In IT space I can divide it like two categories. Extremely large cap big companies and some emerging small cap or mid cap IT space. Personally if I am coming to markets i want to make more than usual returns. Large cap ITs have grown significantly and I do not see them growing 16-18 percent, although i would want more than 20% growth returns. So I always look for mid cap ITs not even small cap because that makes it more risky. So general suggestion, until unless you are too hinged on hcltech you can look for mid cap, see where their operations are what are their services? do this before rate cuts starts because that will give boost to the company's financials in the coming quarters. 

3- Tata steel - You might not like my opinion but reaching 400 in five years is not a big achievement (& is not even guaranteed). Thing is it is highly cyclical stock. Even tata steel mgmt doesn't know what steel prices they would be addressing in next quarter because a lot of volatility is there in such sectors due to geopolitical reasons and much more. Tata mgmt is amazing but business essentially is not good and once the downtrend starts then you will be stuck at one price for long and even the mgmt can't do much if external forces are not in their favor. So in long run you are minimizing your returns if you keep ur money in this stock. All my answers are in assumption of you should be making at least 18-20% returns every year (not just one year)

4-Ambuja Cement- why are you so hinged on infra and building materials? If you see you are keeping such low ROE businesses that automatically will reduce your returns. ROE is an important ratio, ideally it should be above 18% and if cash light business is there like IT then above 25%   


5- Bought the best banking stock. You got it at right levels so cant say much. Not a bad investment and can make good returns 

  
6-  Sula - Ideally not a good sector to invest, and even if you are then you should keep sectoral leaders. These sectors are not something which will observe huge demands all of sudden, understand this. Buying small cap shares makes sense when the sector is in huge demand. UB was much better choice. And if you asked me I would say you should invest in proper consumption stock rather than this. 

7- IRFC - another low ROE business. Seems like you got it by hearing its name in news or x. I mean you can invest but again from long term if you are here to make good returns then focus should be on right sectors, high roe business. 

8- Goldbees - I do not invest in bees personally and I have a neutral view on it. 

Overall your returns are less not just from one year view but I can see your future pf trajectory. I know you are not open to make changes but you should make changes at this level to improve your pf for the future.

General advice

1- Do not be in love with any share/company. We do have our favourites where we think we are gonna make money, company is good. But we cannot be fixated. We are here to make money and not keep the loving company even if we are losing money. 

2- Always be in search for better ideas/themes. I think your pf is more towards low roe business, more infra related and if infra theme fails then this pf will give less returns. Try to think of other themes. I urge you to research on consumption stocks because in long run consumption shares can give 20-25% returns. Technology shares and financial shares can do the same. 

I hope I did not offend you but I gave an honest view as if you were my younger brother. Keep growing and learning and happy investing.

comment,1gk40bk,,,,,,,lvjetlk,One-Suggestion-5366,"It basically takes average:

168 and 150
Which is near to 159

so it's not possible that u sold a share which you bought at 150 and kept the 168 one


also if you buy only 1 share for testing please check out the brokerage and charges before selling 

only selling 1 share will also liable to pay almost 20-25 as charges like dp charges and other charges 

So if u sold only 1 share actually u will incur a loss because  for example 

if u sold a share at 170

Which u bought at 160 

So u think there is profit of 10

But after charges u will nearly receive 145 in ur bank account

post,1icrfhv,Tata Steel becomes India's first to develop hydrogen transport pipes.,ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/9p2z5x1e1xfe1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a9498ebf7eda699dcf92e51fa00f55270069c99

Tata Steel has achieved a groundbreaking milestone by becoming India’s first company to develop hydrogen transport pipes, a significant leap in the clean energy sector. This innovation positions Tata Steel as a key player in India’s green energy transition and could have long-term positive implications for the company’s growth and market positioning.

From a technical perspective, Tata Steel’s stock is currently in a downtrend, trading below its support trendline and the 40-week EMA. However, it is now resting on a critical Fibonacci golden zone, a level often associated with potential reversals. This zone also coincides with the 40-month EMA, adding further significance to this support level. Historically, such confluence zones have acted as strong areas for price reversals or consolidation.

The news of Tata Steel’s hydrogen transport pipes could serve as a fundamental catalyst to complement this technical setup. If market sentiment turns positive on this development, it could potentially reignite buying interest and help the stock resume an uptrend. However, investors should remain cautious and monitor price action closely, as broader market conditions and sectoral trends will also play a role in determining the stock’s direction.",2025-01-29 11:10:26,21.0,5.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1icrfhv/tata_steel_becomes_indias_first_to_develop/,IndianStockMarket

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1i6e6z7,Bearish Setup in Tata Steel: Is the Downtrend Resuming?,ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/5h16jn496bee1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1af1a05614d78510a69a3fbd88ca0a98107192f1

The primary trend of Tata Steel is in a downtrend, as indicated by the Dow Trend Scanner. Both the monthly and weekly trends are bearish. However, the secondary trend, which reflects the movement on smaller timeframes, is currently positive, suggesting that the stock is experiencing a pullback.  
On the hourly chart, the stock has broken down below its support trendline, accompanied by an RMI sell signal. This indicates that the pullback might be over and the stock could resume its downtrend.  
Additionally, the 40-hour EMA and the 20-hour SMA of the Bollinger Bands are positioned near the breakdown area. If the stock closes below both the 40-hour EMA at level of 129.5 and the 20-hour SMA of the Bollinger Bands at level 130, it would further confirm the continuation of the downtrend.",2025-01-21 08:34:10,3.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1i6e6z7/bearish_setup_in_tata_steel_is_the_downtrend/,IndianStockMarket

I invested in these stocks mainly because of their solid history, potential to grow. These stocks are already big names but I found these having potential to grow because of their sectors.

post,1f42qsb,Portfolio Review : Suggest buy/sell/hold,TravellinCoder,"I have created this portfolio over the period of last 4 years, barring 1-2 stocks. Over the time, with suggestions from friends, and other advice, the stock count has grown considerably. Total of 87 scripts.

* Some came from smallcase (invested in 1 about 3 yrs back, didn't add more)
* Other reasons to add - own analysis, sectoral growth, blue chip big name etc.

  
You will also see some smaller investments in this, as and when with whatever amount I could manage. Thankfully, they have turned out well, but can't brag about these returns as investment was very small ! And then there are some troubled ones, I dunno if I should average them.

I am looking to clean up this list considerably, and infuse fresh money.

post,1dk36nr,Portfolio and Strategy Review,Low-Musician-163,"Hello everyone, I am a university student and have been investing in the market since last 3 years. I have attached my portfolio below. I usually wait for my stocks to hit a certain price before I take out the principal amount and the profit remains invested in the stock itself. I try to choose stocks with good fundamentals and have not consistently invested in a stock because I may not have the patience for it right now and also my capital is limited. I know no. of stocks are greater compared to the capital invested but some of my bets take more time to give returns and some are impulse decisions that I intend to cut down.

after that something happened, i won't say what. even till 2025 the Loss, the dues isn't over, parents Life savings and retirement money, post office certificates, bank FDs, PF, pension gone to fill the hole and arrest, at one point of time mother's mangal sutra was kept to get 10,000 at 36 percent interest, plus still dues payable. his salaries went to repay, PF withdrew, still dues payable. brokers, banks, nbfc, credit cards, financiers ring doorbell at afternoon, sleep time, holidays, weekends and stand outside of door for long time, asking neighbors where are we, who's inside, when someone came and Left. he changed phone number telling at home his handset was lost. no house, broken family, my education money was gone, education stopped. crying parents and no future. drinking, smoking, tobacco, huge weight loss, bad habits causing termination from job - lies, 

steals money from home, gets up in morning goes to drink, comes home afternoon eats 1 spoon food goes out to drink, constantly in sleep, falls in mysterious places, mysterious injuries, dogs bark at him, he beat dog/s with a stick, society warned father for it, returns home full stomach of alcohol so can't eat dinner goes to sleep, wakes up around 2am 3am and argues with parents, smashing things in rage. threatening to beat them, mother told father that he has punched her but i can't confirm because i didn't see by own eyes, mother and father chose to keep watching you tube day and night as an escape, shouting, yelling, screaming, cussing, self slaps and punches. no hunger, can't digest, number 1 and 2 in pants, no bath, no brushing, entire room smells, man just waiting for death. doesn't go to doctors, doesn't do checkups. liver is probably destroyed and gets heart palpitations, breathing issues. he basically was dead the day market reversed in 2008. now we just wait for the body to die.

comment,1jwkg3v,,,,,,,mmj6unp,Puzzleheaded-Bug2425,"Interest is Charged Daily

Most brokers charge ~18%–24% annual interest on the borrowed amount.

Even if your stock goes up, that interest eats into your profit.

Broker Can Sell Your Stock (Margin Call)

If the stock drops a lot or your margin falls below required levels, the broker may auto-sell your shares.

It’s Not Free Money

This is leverage — profits can go up fast, but losses hurt more too.

You need to settle it later. You can’t hold MTF forever. 


You need to either:

Sell the stock and repay the borrowed money.

Add more margin to hold it longer.

Or convert it into delivery (pay full amount and take ownership).",2025-04-11 08:54:48,4.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1jwkg3v/what_have_i_gotten_myself_into/,StockMarketIndia

Secondly, you have got some good stock picks there, but try to pick stocks based on your own knowledge and analysis. Don't pay attention to social media hype or tips and recommendations. And as the amount is small dont over diversify stocks, selling those 1 quantity stocks will result in charges and brokerges fees more.

Last but not least, i think you are quiet young, dont invest anymore in individual stock picks now m start a mutual fund instead, like a  Index fund. Keep investing there and, side by side, study how the stock market works more thoroughly.

post,1kyb0lv,Started sharing my stock portfolio after 2 years – here are 11 stocks I am watching,singhethics,"Hello everyone,

Today is 29 May 2025, and after 2 years I am finally starting to share my stock picks publicly. Some of these stocks I bought a few days back, and some just yesterday.

I personally feel these stocks can perform well in the coming weeks.  
But I am clearly saying – do your own research before taking any trade.  
This post is just to boost my own morale, not for giving tips or recommendations.

Here is my current list of stocks that I am tracking or holding:

1. **COMSYN** \#COMSYN
2. **RATNAVEER** \#RATNAVEER
3. **NELCAST** \#NELCAST
4. **PRSMJOHNSN** \#PRSMJOHNSN
5. **TATASTEEL** \#TATASTEEL
6. **NAHARINDUS** \#NAHARINDUS
7. **LYKALABS** \#LYKALABS
8. **NIVABUPA** \#NIVABUPA
9. **SHREERAMA** \#SHREERAMA
10. **DELTACORP** \#DELTACORP
11. **NAVKARCORP** \#NAVKARCORP

If you are tracking any of these, or planning to add them to watchlist, feel free to comment.  
Also, if these stocks go up or down, do share your updates below – it will help all of us learn together.

**Once again – this is not a tip, just a retail trader sharing his personal picks with the community.**

Thanks and all the best to everyone.  
Let us grow together in the market.",2025-05-29 13:38:00,2.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1kyb0lv/started_sharing_my_stock_portfolio_after_2_years/,StockMarketIndia

post,1icr9h1,Tata Steel becomes India's first to develop hydrogen transport pipes.,ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/zfe9kvqjwwfe1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d25fe72ca7b143cd44e485a4fc546f02ccd71960



Tata Steel has achieved a groundbreaking milestone by becoming India’s first company to develop hydrogen transport pipes, a significant leap in the clean energy sector. This innovation positions Tata Steel as a key player in India’s green energy transition and could have long-term positive implications for the company’s growth and market positioning.

From a technical perspective, Tata Steel’s stock is currently in a downtrend, trading below its support trendline and the 40-week EMA. However, it is now resting on a critical Fibonacci golden zone, a level often associated with potential reversals. This zone also coincides with the 40-month EMA, adding further significance to this support level. Historically, such confluence zones have acted as strong areas for price reversals or consolidation.

The news of Tata Steel’s hydrogen transport pipes could serve as a fundamental catalyst to complement this technical setup. If market sentiment turns positive on this development, it could potentially reignite buying interest and help the stock resume an uptrend. However, investors should remain cautious and monitor price action closely, as broader market conditions and sectoral trends will also play a role in determining the stock’s direction.",2025-01-29 10:59:34,19.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1icr9h1/tata_steel_becomes_indias_first_to_develop/,StockMarketIndia

post,1i6e5vi,Bearish Setup in Tata Steel: Is the Downtrend Resuming?,ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/ztewcjar5bee1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75d402469999db77f4bde0c9bb06a86854666b4b

The primary trend of Tata Steel is in a downtrend, as indicated by the Dow Trend Scanner. Both the monthly and weekly trends are bearish. However, the secondary trend, which reflects the movement on smaller timeframes, is currently positive, suggesting that the stock is experiencing a pullback.  
On the hourly chart, the stock has broken down below its support trendline, accompanied by an RMI sell signal. This indicates that the pullback might be over and the stock could resume its downtrend.  
Additionally, the 40-hour EMA and the 20-hour SMA of the Bollinger Bands are positioned near the breakdown area. If the stock closes below both the 40-hour EMA at level of 129.5 and the 20-hour SMA of the Bollinger Bands at level 130, it would further confirm the continuation of the downtrend.",2025-01-21 08:31:45,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1i6e5vi/bearish_setup_in_tata_steel_is_the_downtrend/,StockMarketIndia

post,1icripq,Tata Steel becomes India's first to develop hydrogen transport pipes.,ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/wzth1tpj2xfe1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e99d205462a2ea9bc6f3cee0e900f7560d2bca8a

Tata Steel has achieved a groundbreaking milestone by becoming India’s first company to develop hydrogen transport pipes, a significant leap in the clean energy sector. This innovation positions Tata Steel as a key player in India’s green energy transition and could have long-term positive implications for the company’s growth and market positioning.

From a technical perspective, Tata Steel’s stock is currently in a downtrend, trading below its support trendline and the 40-week EMA. However, it is now resting on a critical Fibonacci golden zone, a level often associated with potential reversals. This zone also coincides with the 40-month EMA, adding further significance to this support level. Historically, such confluence zones have acted as strong areas for price reversals or consolidation.

The news of Tata Steel’s hydrogen transport pipes could serve as a fundamental catalyst to complement this technical setup. If market sentiment turns positive on this development, it could potentially reignite buying interest and help the stock resume an uptrend. However, investors should remain cautious and monitor price action closely, as broader market conditions and sectoral trends will also play a role in determining the stock’s direction.",2025-01-29 11:16:42,8.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1icripq/tata_steel_becomes_indias_first_to_develop/,IndianStreetBets

The primary trend of Tata Steel is in a downtrend, as indicated by the Dow Trend Scanner. Both the monthly and weekly trends are bearish. However, the secondary trend, which reflects the movement on smaller timeframes, is currently positive, suggesting that the stock is experiencing a pullback.  
On the hourly chart, the stock has broken down below its support trendline, accompanied by an RMI sell signal. This indicates that the pullback might be over and the stock could resume its downtrend.  
Additionally, the 40-hour EMA and the 20-hour SMA of the Bollinger Bands are positioned near the breakdown area. If the stock closes below both the 40-hour EMA at level of 129.5 and the 20-hour SMA of the Bollinger Bands at level 130, it would further confirm the continuation of the downtrend.",2025-01-21 08:35:29,2.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1i6e7m8/bearish_setup_in_tata_steel_is_the_downtrend/,IndianStreetBets

post,1edbltp,110% since Russia - Ukraine war.,Jarhem,"Invested in early 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine and the market went down. Planning to book some profits but unsure if I should keep on holding or not.

For more context - When this portfolio reached 60% mark I shifted to Zerodha on my friends suggestion. 
Now I have some 1.5 lac invested there with 20% return. Is it worth to keep juggling between both app knowing that I will only invest in one of these apps i.e Zehroda in this case. 
Novice here, who was at a look out for market getting a hit before I invest back in 2022. Fortunately, the opportunity came with the war.
Now looking at this, portfolio, I understand that it’s not an easy money and requires patience and commitment. There was an initial period where even these tanked to -20% but I never panic sold any one.
