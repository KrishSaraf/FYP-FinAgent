post,1j03cqb,"Nifty IT Crashes 4%: TCS Hits 52-Week Low, TechM Sinks 6% – What’s Behind the Sell-Off?",ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/8izlcm2ofule1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c69e1deaadbd8e28403c9a75e5990eba98b9b656

On February 28, 2025, the Indian stock market experienced a significant downturn, with the Nifty IT index plummeting over 4%. This decline was led by major IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which reached a 52-week low, and Tech Mahindra (TechM), which fell by approximately 6%. Persistent Systems also faced substantial losses, with its stock dropping around 6%. This sell-off was largely influenced by global market trends, particularly the disappointing earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia, which triggered a ripple effect across international markets, including India.

The broader market sentiment was also negative, with the Sensex falling over 1,000 points and the Nifty dropping below the 22,300 mark. This broad-based sell-off affected multiple sectors, including auto, metals, and banking. Factors contributing to the decline include global economic uncertainty, profit booking across markets, and the impact of Nvidia's earnings report. Despite these challenges, the IT sector remains a crucial component of India's economy, though ongoing global uncertainties pose significant risks.",2025-02-28 08:49:46,3.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1j03cqb/nifty_it_crashes_4_tcs_hits_52week_low_techm/,IndianStockMarket

Despite a sharp selloff in the Indian stock market on Monday, the IT sector took the biggest hit, falling by 2.71%. LTIM saw the steepest decline, dropping more than 4%, followed by LTTS, Wipro, HCL Tech, and others.

# Why Did IT Stocks Decline Today?

The IT sector was the worst performer as the US market suffered a steep decline in the previous session due to rising inflation concerns and the impact of Trump-era tariffs. On Friday, US markets closed significantly lower, triggering a negative sentiment in Indian IT stocks.",2025-02-24 13:31:24,18.0,3.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ix22v6/market_selloff_hits_it_stocks_today/,IndianStockMarket

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

This is not volume delta. Volume delta columns are different from it. This is something else that i could not find. 

Is it volume indicator or something else. Do you know? Please tell if you know.

Hello fellow investors,

I would like your suggestions on my IT portfolio. I feel it is over diversified and I think I need to balance a bit. I started investing in it through SIP basis over 4 years now. the returns are okay for now, as I am a conservative investor I am heavy into large caps. I also have ITBEES worth 50K rupees in this account which I don't want to sell but add more when there is a huge drop in IT index.

I am thinking to have one large cap, two(or 1) midcaps running in this portfolio. Let me know if my below selection makes any sense.

I want to sell Infy and TCS and move those funds to HCLTech as the recent reports suggested that they are focused more on AI compared to the large cap competition and also HCL pays really good dividend. I think I won't go wrong in choosing 1 out of three as all are heavy weights.

on the other stocks I want to hold only KPIT and NewGen as again there is more room to grow for these stocks compared to the other two. I don't have a solid reason as all of these stocks are on the same boat more or less have the same ratios as well. I know they did run a lot in the recent bullrun but I think IT is a safe bet if the investment horizon is long term.

I was so furious that I didn't SIP regularly in NEWGEN but I did in other stocks.

P.S. I also had Wipro and TechM which I sold a year back and moved the funds to ITBEES.

Please help me with your valuable suggestions....roast me if needed.",2024-10-19 11:04:16,2.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g76h8p/it_portfolio_changes_suggestions/,IndianStockMarket

post,1j03bqc,"Nifty IT Crashes 4%: TCS Hits 52-Week Low, TechM Sinks 6% – What’s Behind the Sell-Off?",ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/0s01nq48fule1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b70295bb3522d1529a8b8f1de77cb7f308398844

On February 28, 2025, the Indian stock market experienced a significant downturn, with the Nifty IT index plummeting over 4%. This decline was led by major IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which reached a 52-week low, and Tech Mahindra (TechM), which fell by approximately 6%. Persistent Systems also faced substantial losses, with its stock dropping around 6%. This sell-off was largely influenced by global market trends, particularly the disappointing earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia, which triggered a ripple effect across international markets, including India.

The broader market sentiment was also negative, with the Sensex falling over 1,000 points and the Nifty dropping below the 22,300 mark. This broad-based sell-off affected multiple sectors, including auto, metals, and banking. Factors contributing to the decline include global economic uncertainty, profit booking across markets, and the impact of Nvidia's earnings report. Despite these challenges, the IT sector remains a crucial component of India's economy, though ongoing global uncertainties pose significant risks.",2025-02-28 08:47:44,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1j03bqc/nifty_it_crashes_4_tcs_hits_52week_low_techm/,StockMarketIndia

T stocks are in demand today as the Nifty IT index hit a record high, driven by optimistic growth projections for the sector, with HSBC forecasting a 6-7% growth in FY26.

**Let's analyze the sector using RRG.**

Leading Quadrant: LTIM, Wipro, Persistent Systems, and Mphasis are in the leading quadrant. However, LTIM and Mphasis both are losing strength and are moving towards the weakening quadrant.

Weakening Quadrant: Coforge and TCS are in the weakening quadrant, with TCS appearing weaker than Coforge.

Lagging Quadrant: LTTS, HCL Tech, and Tech Mahindra are in the lagging quadrant. Among them, HCL Tech is gaining strength and moving toward the improving quadrant.

Improving Quadrant: Infosys has just entered the improving quadrant and could regain strength moving forward.",2024-12-12 08:02:20,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hcgbp7/why_are_it_stocks_in_demand_today_as_nifty_it/,StockMarketIndia

post,1j03dew,"Nifty IT Crashes 4%: TCS Hits 52-Week Low, TechM Sinks 6% – What’s Behind the Sell-Off?",ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/kuuchxhyfule1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3231aff0a768f8a66742812a530273d3cabfc7c

On February 28, 2025, the Indian stock market experienced a significant downturn, with the Nifty IT index plummeting over 4%. This decline was led by major IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which reached a 52-week low, and Tech Mahindra (TechM), which fell by approximately 6%. Persistent Systems also faced substantial losses, with its stock dropping around 6%. This sell-off was largely influenced by global market trends, particularly the disappointing earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia, which triggered a ripple effect across international markets, including India.

The broader market sentiment was also negative, with the Sensex falling over 1,000 points and the Nifty dropping below the 22,300 mark. This broad-based sell-off affected multiple sectors, including auto, metals, and banking. Factors contributing to the decline include global economic uncertainty, profit booking across markets, and the impact of Nvidia's earnings report. Despite these challenges, the IT sector remains a crucial component of India's economy, though ongoing global uncertainties pose significant risks.",2025-02-28 08:51:16,3.0,3.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1j03dew/nifty_it_crashes_4_tcs_hits_52week_low_techm/,IndianStreetBets

post,1jqdyek,Indian IT stocks CRASH! Here's all you need to know!,The_Market_Maven,"The Nifty IT index dropped 4.05%, with Infosys, TCS, and HCL Tech leading the fall after Trump imposed a 26% tariff on Indian imports.

But the bigger worry? Over 50% of Indian IT revenue comes from the US. If the US economy slows, companies may cut Tech budgets, hurting Indian IT firms.

Add AI automation and inflation fears, the road ahead looks uncertain.

Here's a quick breakdown:

* Trump's new tariffs are raising concerns about trade barriers and cost pressures.
