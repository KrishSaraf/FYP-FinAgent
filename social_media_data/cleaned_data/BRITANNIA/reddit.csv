post,1ixlgvp,"Jio finance being added to nifty 50, still a mystery?",1xaonc,"Jio Financial Services Limited (JFSL) was listed in August 2023 after being demerged from Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) to unlock the value of RIL’s financial services business.

JFSL formed a joint venture with BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management company. Both parties committed to investing $300 million (₹2,500 crore) each as an initial investment to build a “digital-first asset management business.”

All of this seems promising, but what exactly is Jio Finance trying to become? As of now, only ₹117 crore has been invested in JFSL, with more to come over the next several years. It is currently expanding into multiple sectors:

1. Asset & Wealth Management.

		SEBI has approved JFSL to launch its first mutual fund in 2025.

2. Lending & Credit Services.

		Plans to offer consumer loans, SME financing, and secured loans.

3. Insurance.

		Exploring potential entry into life, health, and general insurance with a digital-first approach.

4. Payments & Banking. 

	    Jio Payments Bank, a joint venture with SBI, is already operational, offering UPI and banking services.

5. Stock Broking & Advisory.

	      Launched Jio BlackRock Broking Private Limited to offer stock trading and advisory services.

6. NBFC.

		JFSL has NBFC status, allowing it to lend directly without being a bank.
		Expected to enter housing finance, auto loans, and SME loans.

Here's where the real uncertainty comes. JFSL is in every sector and no doubt might disrupt this too being a conglomerate but a company like jio which is barely operational is replacing Bharat Petroleum a well established company

While JFSL is expanding aggressively, its business strategy lacks clear direction.

JFSL holds a 6.1% stake in Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). With RIL’s current market cap at ₹17.4 lakh crore, JFSL’s stake alone is worth nearly ₹1.4 lakh crore.

However, JFSL’s own market cap was initially just ₹20,000 crore, which means that its valuation was massively inflated due to its RIL stake, rather than its core financial services business.

JFSL is trying to enter every financial sector at once, asset management, broking, lending, payments, insurance, NBFC, and fintech instead of focusing on one vertical and expanding from there

Even its Jio BlackRock AMC got SEBI approval, yet the mutual fund is still not operational, and its revenues, profits, and assets remain uncertain and nothing is sure about the company's balance sheet yet about what's happening.


Added to Nifty 50 But Does It Deserve It?

Despite its lack of execution, JFSL will be added to the Nifty 50 on March 28, 2025, replacing BPCL.

Zomato will replace Britannia in the same reshuffle, might make a post on it later.

JFSL’s inclusion is primarily based on its free-float market capitalization, not its financial performance.

It recently corrected due to overvaluation. Despite holding only 6.1% of RIL, it was given an inflated market cap and is now being added to Nifty 50.


Jio Financial Services just seems to me like a reliance backed company without any plans in the near future just going into every sector possible but at this point the company just seems too new to be added to the nifty 50, what are your thoughts?",2025-02-25 03:29:13,53.0,8.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ixlgvp/jio_finance_being_added_to_nifty_50_still_a/,IndianStockMarket

post,1gpcbar,"My first experience with FnO. Made 30k, lost 40k. But gained valuable learnings.",manku_d_virus,"I was always cautious of FnO, but decided to try it out of fomo.
I was trying to do result based trading.
It worked out well when the prediction was correct for ambuja cement and I was heavily bullish, which gave me a good starting point.

From then on, it's been a series of losses.

1. I stopped taking very strong positions. I took 3 lot of options and equity for Asian paints, lost a lot of money.

Now I take 1 lot of future OR options OR equity.

2. I tried to do 'in the money' trade, took put for Asian paints when it went down heavily.
I made some money back that way, but ended up losing all that money and more.

I also learnt that FnO aren't as liquid as equity. Even if I was putting in the same value as the market price, order was taking too long to execute.
So no more unnecessary risk.

3. I was in a good position with a Britannia future, it was going upto some 19k profit.
I had to present in an office meeting and got 5 minutes delayed after the result, it started plummeting.

I tried to sell a couple of times but no buyers. Finally sold it for a measly profit of 1.5k.
Damn near broke my heart.

This teaches me to prioritise result announcement time over anything else.

Bad trades come and go but Hopefully I'll be more careful and not lose anymore money out of stupidity.

Ever since they removed margin for F&O (a few years ago) volume on stock F&O dried up. Commodities, same result. Actually the crude oil contract in MCX used to be so liquid that foreign traders used to trade on it. But of course SEBI did not like that. Also, RBI outright banned the currency market in April. You can check the volume on that now. It is a ghost town.

After Nov 20 it will get so much worse. The common theme is that SEBI does not like F&O and they are slowly killing it in India.

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1iwtzxh,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund",Broad-Research5220,"**The Good**:



* In 12 out of 14 years, the fund delivered positive returns, with standout years like **2009 (91.19%)** and **2014 (41.10%)**.
* Sectors like Banking (24.2%) and IT (10.3%) dominate, but it’s not overly concentrated.
* At \~20–30%, the turnover ratio is fine.



**The Bad**:

Between 2015–2022, it often lagged the Nifty 100 TRI during rolling 5-year periods. So, it might struggle in certain market cycles.

**The Ugly**:

A high R-squared (96.64%) means it moves closely with the market, offering little diversification benefit during crashes.

post,1fneror,Review my low risk appetite portfolio (investments over past ~6 years),HawkNo1373,"Hi all

I have been in the markets for the past 6 years and have invested with an extremely low appetite. Of course I have churned my portfolio over the years, booked a lot of profits and reinvested the gains. I have a cash position of \~7L which is my ""opportunity fund"". The percentage in the ""unrealised gains"" column is actually XIRR (so you get an idea of how old the investment is).

My investments over the past 1 year I have marked with a red ""X"". Should I take more risks and allocate a bigger share of my portfolio to small caps?

I mean whatever growth you are looking, I think you can get a lot more by other fmcg shares rather than nestle and tata consumer. LT foods is nice bet which if goes well can make you good returns but still one strong fundamental that I would look for is itc. I know very controversial and many don't like it but the demerger will improve their balance sheet. Their current return on assets will improve too, since the current balance sheet contains huge capex of their hotel business too so we can evaluate better once the demerger happens. 

Tata consumer isn't bad stock either but at current levels or recent levels it is over valued and not sure how much returns expected from here. VBL is amazing buy!   
And Asian paints, margins will suffer for sure moving ahead and even I was holding it at good levels but I moved out from it and invested same amount in some other stock which is growing at faster rate. 

My main focus is on stock should not be that large that growth is minimal, I know risk should be managed too but still. That is just my perspective, everyone have their own style and I respect each one of the view as long as it has rationale behind it.

post,1g9nizu,Planning to take 10L loan for long term( Oct - Dec time investment),rohit9967,"Hi Reddit family,

With the market trending down, I'm considering some promising stocks such as Tata Motors, CDSL, Bajaj Housing Finance, Castrol, TCS, ONGC, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Steel, UltraTech Cement, Reliance, Tata Tech, Tata Consumer Products, Britannia, Titan, IEX, Coal India, BEL, IOC, and Nifty ETFs.

These are potential stocks and indices I’m looking at, but I plan to narrow it down to just 10 for investment (mostly focusing on Tata stocks).

I’ve been investing for the long term over the past few years and am not in a rush to withdraw the invested money, as it’s meant solely for investment (longer than 5+ years) Additionally, I can manage to pay off my loan in a few months (maximum 4-5 months).

I would appreciate your guidance on whether this is a good decision and any advice or suggestions you might have. 

I’m planning to invest between October and December, and I intend to hold some investments until the U.S. election period and results. What are your thoughts on this? Kindly guide me.


Personal context : I am 28, No loan in my name, been investing for 5 years so far, credit score is good (781+) and not doing any trading or other stuff.",2024-10-22 17:16:39,0.0,8.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g9nizu/planning_to_take_10l_loan_for_long_term_oct_dec/,IndianStockMarket

post,1j08pjs,Britannia Industries ( Stable FMCG player available at a lucrative discount ),Ok_Art8419,The presence of this company is in nearly every household across India .At a price of approx 4600 Rupees per share it is available at the discount of rougly 28 percent .This sector typically indicates the state of a country's economy which doesn't look quite good as of making this post . But cycles do change and when it does the stock will be a beneficiary of the INDIAN CONSUMPTION STORY .The support lines are drawn in blue (for ease ).Even if it reaches its all the high in let's say in 2 years that's still a 18 percent CAGR .Suitable for investors who have atleast a 1.5 year horizon and want to take minimal risk .

If I made a lumpsum investment in NIFTY 50 mutual fund on 1994 then I have received ""fractions of each shares "" present in Nifty 50 at 1994.

Now when i sell the same in 2024, 75% of the 1994 stocks have already lost the shine. So i would be getting good profit from ""fractions of stocks"" like Unilever/SBI/Reliance who have survived this 20 year ride.  , so ultimately i would be receiving very less profit when i redeem in 2024 as valuations of All other stocks has reduced too much

post,1i5qqn4,why xomato is about that bullsh!t as on 20-jan-25,Ig1M,"being in main index, that is made up of our country's biggest giant companies, which is laughable.
it is possible it was done to support the stock price, or bring other people's money in, via passive flows, so existing biggies could dump.
if xomato is in sensex, it is 33rd in rank by mcap today. and it was 1/6th just 2 years ago. for how Long it has been in top 30? if it's a mega giant Largecap,it should behave Like it, not Like a b!tch.

its market cap is higher than real companies Like:
Asian Paints/ Siemens/ Nestle India - Britannia/ DLF - Lodha/ VBL/ Tata Steel/ Divis lab - Cipla - mankind Pharma - Dr Reddy - Lupin/ indigo/ Grasim/ SBI Life - HDFC Life/ Hyundai Motor/ Pidilite/ Hindalco/ Ambuja/ Baroda Bank - PNB - IOB/ Polycab - Havells

xomato isn't better than LTIMINDTREE, Tech Mahindra, Coforge, LTTS, Sonata soft, Birlasoft, Cyient, Zensar, Mphasis, TATA Elxsi, KPIT Tech, Honeywell, Tata Tech, Delhivery, BDL, indigo - they fly aeroplane in the air for gods sake, ABB, Persistent, Bosch, OFSS, GMR Airports, BSE the damn exchange, vodafone idea the entire company, BlueDart, etc. thats nuts. 

infact xomato's mcap is more than entire Polycab & Havells combined together, that did 5,498+4,889= 10,387 crores sales in 3 months, whereas xomato sales 5,405: half of above.
half sales, double mcap?

PE of 351 means its equal to 

buying india's highest PAT earning bank SBI share at 28,143 

or buying india's highest PAT earning company Reliance share at 17,946

or buying 1 MRF share at 16 Lakh 11 Thousand, assholess!

after doing every exploitation under the sun, it is a 3% OPM business, and they rely on other income for profit. can't fund own expansion, needs fundraising and someone keeps buying a 4cr sports car each time.

since jan 2024, more and more retail has entered the stock, taking the price from 133 to 302. preferential shares and QIB shares have been allotted to big companies at better prices.

post,1g9nmbk,Planning to take 10L loan for long term( Oct - Dec time investment),rohit9967,"Hi Reddit family,

With the market trending down, I'm considering some promising stocks such as Tata Motors, CDSL, Bajaj Housing Finance, Castrol, TCS, ONGC, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Steel, UltraTech Cement, Reliance, Tata Tech, Tata Consumer Products, Britannia, Titan, IEX, Coal India, BEL, IOC, and Nifty ETFs.

These are potential stocks and indices I’m looking at, but I plan to narrow it down to just 10 for investment (mostly focusing on Tata stocks).

I’ve been investing for the long term over the past few years and am not in a rush to withdraw the invested money, as it’s meant solely for investment. Additionally, I can manage to pay off my loan in a few months (maximum 4-5 months).

I would appreciate your guidance on whether this is a good decision and any advice or suggestions you might have. 


I’m planning to invest between October and December, and I intend to hold some investments until the U.S. election period and results. What are your thoughts on this? Kindly guide me.

post,1i563pv,BBTC valuations ,getprshah,"BBTC indirectly holds 121,732,190 shares of Britannia Industries Ltd (through it's subsidiaries) {source : annual report of Britannia industries} 

Given BI's LTP apx 4855 AOD, then total holding value is 121,732,190 x 4855 equals 5,91,00,97,82,450

 ... which divided by the number of shares in BBTC : 69,771,900

 gives BBTC a holding value of Apx 8,470 PER SHARE... which makes it's current market price of 2,003 (LTP) less than one-fourth of its holdings in BIL alone.

Even assuming a holding company discount of the usual 40%, this seems unusual...
