comment,1gomjs8,,,,,,,lwjrz6m,UpperValleyDude,"Lots of companies make paint, Berger, Kansainer...
What's so special about Asian paints? 
The company as far as I see has no moat. 
Nothing extraordinary in their sales, distribution system or any spectacular results in their product that is different from the market. 
It's just ...like any other paint company. 
Operating profit is bad and falling
Poor sales growth. 

Buy something else if you have to. 
I lean towards speciality chemicals more and I like Pidilite it having a high PE and low ROE nevertheless, the business is good. They sell novel products, household name...fevi stock, fevikwik, dr fixit etc.  and cheaply available at ...any kiryana, stationery shop. ( Fevikwik Rs. 5/-) 

Despite the high PE, I believe it's evergreen and has many trade secrets so the business can't be copied to a very great extent and will have monopoly for a long time. 
The underlying business is good : 
Operating profit margin increasing steadily Y.O.Y. 
1000 cr sales increasing Y.O.Y. 
Debt Free 
EPS increasing Y.O.Y. 
Spending wisely on Fixed assets. 
Disposing laggard fixed assets. 
Management is initiated and responsive. 

Overall good company. Can't go wrong in long term.",2024-11-11 07:38:00,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gomjs8/anyone_buying_asianpaints/,IndianStockMarket

post,1frjxu7,ASIANPAINT Analysis - One of the safest bets in the current market!,Business_Ad_1738,"IMO, it’s a great stock for SIP, and in the short term, it could rise to ₹4600 (\~40%)

  
**Chart Analysis:**  
1. The stock has been consolidating within a range of ₹2700-₹3500 for the last three years.  
2. The PE ratio is reasonable for such a market leader.  
3. A well-defined channel has formed, presenting swing trade opportunities with a potential 25-35% return.

**Financials:**  
1. Revenue and net profit have grown significantly over the last three years.  
2. Reserves have been steadily increasing.  
3. The rise in fixed assets and CWIP indicates ongoing expansion efforts.

**News:**  
1. Expansion: The company is diversifying beyond paints into home décor, furniture, kitchens, and more.  
2. Acquisitions: They recently acquired Nanova to venture into nano-coating technology. Although it’s a small investment, it reflects the management’s innovative mindset.  
3. With crude oil prices dropping, the paint industry stands to benefit, as crude oil is a major raw material.

post,1izl5si,Reserves & Surplus are big frauds in India,gagan1985,"If Reserves get 2-3% interest while same company paying 8-9% interest on 1/3rd reserves as borrowings. That result in Net cash outflow.

why borrow so much if you have so much ""Reserves & Surplus"" that is not employed in **Good way**. Employing Reserves & Surplus in effective way makes sens,e but not at 2-3% interest rate and borrowing on 3x of that.   
I am not against borrowing, it helps in taxes. However, I am against poor allocation of capital. Or, is there a big fraud there? If yes, then that will collapse pretty soon.

  
**Can somebody tell me why am I wrong?**

Let me give you examples,

  
All amounts in Crores

|Company|Reserves  |Other Income|Borrowings|Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|RELIANCE|812,687|17,607|357,525|23,875|
|ADANI|41,782|1,646|80,427|5,694|

|TCS|101,133|4,091|9,046|795|
|Bharti Airtel|84,202|10,852|225,541|21,455|

  
Bharti Airtel is in shit load on debt but atleast earning well on reserves than borrowings.

Coming to the question, I think we may be missing out on some things, but what I know is, getting debt to fund their expansion plans and business is more easier, otherwise billionaires like Mukesh Ambani, Sunil Mittal, etc, won't be taking so much debt.

Also, just see the interest payment on those debt by these companies VS the profit they earn annually. I think that maybe making some sense also in paying debt rather than using reserves.

Started post-Covid. But a substantial sum out of this has been invested in the last 3-4 months.

Point is to review the portfolio / allocation etc. as it stands today - for the future. That is why I have provided current value of holdings (though invested sum can be calculated pretty easily). Past gains (especially %ages) are indicative of pretty much nothing as I have been irregular in buying and accumulating over the said period.

Would love everyone's views and opinions. 

PS - discerning folks on here will be able to see Saurabh Mukherjea's influence but even more discerning (and sympathethic) folks will be able to see I am reducing the said influence now 😄

LATE (AND LONG) EDIT - As rightly said in some replies, MF portfolio has some unnecessary over-complication. I'm slowly moving my inv from Axis ELSS to PP ELSS (as and when 3 year limit ends), so count one less fund. The two PP funds again I count as basically one big Flexi fund, so that's again one less fund. Small caps I don't feel comfortable with just one fund, and the universe is large enough to accommodate two funds. 
So basically-
•one Largecap (Niftybees) 
•one Flexicap (2 PPs + whatever's left of Axis)
•one Large & Mid
•one Midcap
•two Smallcaps
•one USA (where in fact if someone can suggest which should I actually invest in, anyway PP Flexi can't invest more in the US stocks).

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1fi2695,Confusion regarding divesting direct equities into a Nifty 50 Index !? ,bharti18,"Need some advice fam !!

Had invested in these 6 stocks in Jan 2021, should I continue to hold them as they have only yielded 8.5% average annually in last 3.5 years, if you see until now, which is much lower than the average return of a nifty 50 index also…which has been about 14% annually in last 3 years..

I am confused if I should sell of these and take a 12.5% LTCG tax  hit which will bring my average return to 7% something and then start from scratch with this 6 Lac about remains capital by starting a Nifty 50 or should I hold them forget about them for the long term of let say 10/15 years, which I can do actually. LTCG is coming around 18,000 INR as of now.

comment,1kmbv8q,,,,,,,ms8wvc7,mohityadavv,"I started my analysis with Reliance Industries’ announcement that it is selling its 4.9% stake in Asian Paints, a stake it has held for 17 years since buying it in January 2008 for ₹500 crore, as reported by Economic Times (May 2025). This stake is now worth ₹11,141 crore, based on Asian Paints’ closing price of ₹2,323 on May 13, 2025. This means Reliance is making a 24 times return on its original investment. The sale is being managed by Bank of America and is part of Reliance’s broader plan to focus more on its core businesses, especially Jio (its telecom arm) and its green energy ventures. The decision also comes at a time when competition in the paints industry is rising.

I looked into the financial journey of this stake over the years. The ₹500 crore investment grew significantly due to Asian Paints’ strong stock performance over time. But recently, the stock has seen a sharp decline. In the past year alone, it has dropped 19.3% from its 52-week high of ₹3,394, which was recorded on September 16, 2024. This fall has wiped off about ₹51,000 crore from Asian Paints’ market value, which reflects the broader stress in the market.

I explored the competitive environment that’s affecting Asian Paints. I found that its market share has dropped from 59% in FY24 to 52% in FY25. A major reason is the entry of Grasim Industries’ new paint brand, Birla Opus, which quickly gained 3–4% market share in just the third quarter of FY25. Birla Opus is growing fast by using aggressive pricing, heavy advertising, and offering cashback incentives to painters. Industry insiders believe Birla Opus is aiming to reach ₹10,000 crore in revenue within the next three years, which could shake up the market even more. On top of that, Asian Paints is also facing margin pressures due to rising crude oil prices, which affect the cost of raw materials. Reports suggest that if Grasim continues to grow at this pace and reaches a high single-digit market share, Asian Paints’ share among the top nine paint companies might slip further to 50% by the end of FY25. This would make Birla Opus the fourth-largest player in the sector.

I also looked at Asian Paints’ performance during this challenging time. In Q2 of FY25, the company reported a 31.3% increase in net profit compared to the same quarter last year, reaching ₹780 crore. Revenue also grew by 19% to ₹8,460 crore. This shows that the company is still growing, but its stock performance has been weak because of pressure across the industry. Other major players like Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac have also seen big declines of around 24% in 2022. Even though Asian Paints has faced recent setbacks, its total market cap remains strong at ₹222,975 crore. However, it is currently trading at 11.5 times its book value, and its sales growth over the last five years has been a modest 10.9%. Its promoter holding stands at 52.6%, which suggests that those running the company still have faith in its future.

To understand the company’s long-term outlook, I looked at its strengths. Despite the recent dip in stock price and growing competition, Asian Paints still has strong fundamentals. It has a wide distribution network and is known for constantly bringing innovation to its products. These strengths could help the company recover and grow in the long run. The paint sector as a whole is currently facing pricing pressure and slow volume growth, especially in the decorative segment where new players like Grasim are disrupting the market. But many industry experts believe that Asian Paints, with its experience and ability to adapt, could eventually regain lost ground through better products and stronger value offerings.

In summary, Reliance Industries is selling its 4.9% stake in Asian Paints for ₹11,141 crore, which was originally bought for ₹500 crore in 2008, marking a 24-fold gain. The sale is part of Reliance’s move to focus more on telecom and green energy. Meanwhile, Asian Paints is facing growing competition from new players like Birla Opus, which has caused its market share to drop from 59% to 52%. Its stock is also down 19.3% in the last year, leading to a ₹51,000 crore fall in market value. Despite these issues, Asian Paints posted strong profit and revenue growth in Q2 FY25 and still has a solid foundation for future growth.

Now when i sell the same in 2024, 75% of the 1994 stocks have already lost the shine.

Alkyl amines is a commodity company and lacks pricing power so get rid of it because its still trading at 54 PE and Saurabh Mukherjee marketed this company at ridiculous valuations.

Yes bank just sell, if you want banking then stock with Kotak and HDFC Bank. they are high quality available at decent valuations

SBI you can expect anything between 10-12% returns based on their moat and growth rates.The negative tailwind is psi management and the past bank rally euphoria is over.

Arctic long term is good but you overpaid on this one again. You dont make money for 2-4 years if you pay high multiples of 60-70 even if earnings are compounding at decent pace because of mean reversion and pe compression. Arctic fundamentals are growing but the pe is compressing.

Cochin just get rid of it because the growth of next 5 years is already factored in the stock and a compression on multiple can drag it down 20-40%

asian paints long term is fine, but dont average it before the multiples reaches on 30-35 range, its still expensive given the slowdown in consumption and the pace at which its growing.

JIO 100 PE, you wont make  money on such multiples, and margin of safety is zero, one bad execution or news and you can see the stock crashing.,

Sail Is shit company just get out of it and allocate to high quality compounders.

Sharda motors is growing earnings and the valuations are not expensive so you can hold that one. 

Adani Wilmar, well the revenue have remain stagnant for past 4 years and increase in profit was due to financial act of increasing the other income.Its not a high quality company plus there margin profile is weak. Move to better companies who's management you can trust, plus always look at margin profile.

  
If you want any further help you can DM. 

Always screen your stocks through a high quality checklist before investing and never overpay.

One basic issue with your portfolio is that you overpaid for growth and purchased most of stock at 60-80PE, you must have probably came during covid and don't have basic understanding about how markets will behave in long term and how mean reversion destroys wealth.",2025-01-02 19:42:11,6.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hrqodi/should_i_exit_or_increase_holding_if_exit_how_to/,StockMarketIndia
comment,1hrqodi,,,,,,,m524j5o,SuperbPercentage8050,"Well the business is good and eps is growing, you overpaid at 60-80 PE. If you will overpay and buy stocks at such valuations you will have to see negative returns and waiting period of 3-5 years. 

India mart is also going through same stages, 

since 2021 EPS has almost moved up 100%, but because the PE compressed from 100 to 30 you are seeing negative returns.

long term its a compounding high quality business, but 100PE any stock cannot sustain for long and they will revert to mean. same happened with asian paints and will happen with all the stocks trading at ridiculous valuations and growing earnings at 10-15%.

Alkyl Amines is a commodity business and lack pricing power, Saurabh mukhaejea marketed it and people went for it at 100-120 PE. 

so its a learning lesson.

comment,1ihhjcx,,,,,,,max1zfm,ZestycloseJudgment89,"Asian Paints’ stock has fallen 35% from its peak, but despite weak Q3 results, signs of a potential pullback are emerging. The weekly and daily RMI indicators are in buy mode, and the daily chart shows RSI divergence. A breakout could lead to a short-term rebound toward the 20-week SMA or 40-week EMA.

However, the company’s Q3 FY25 results, announced on February 4, showed a 23.3% YoY decline in profit and a 6% drop in revenue, missing market estimates. Can this reversal hold, or will the weak results push the stock lower?",2025-02-04 13:24:35,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1ihhjcx/what_are_your_thoughts_on_asian_paints_q3_results/,StockMarketIndia

comment,1ib0o72,,,,,,,m9emrur,curioussharma-007,"# Trading in a Bear Market: Key Strategies

1. **Trade on Both Sides**
   * As a trader, you can take positions on both sides of the market: **long** (bullish) and **short** (bearish).
   * This is a bear market where prices are falling consistently. Instead of waiting for recovery, utilize basic short-selling strategies.
2. **Short Selling Strategy for Futures**
   * Identify stocks that are trending **down** on a weekly timeframe.
   * On the daily timeframe, look for stocks where the **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** is above 70, indicating they are overbought.
   * Enter a short position in futures, as the bias aligns with the downward trend.
3. **Intraday Short Selling Strategy**
   * Use the **ADX (Average Directional Index)** to confirm trends.
   * Look for stocks trending **down** on the daily chart, but with **RSI above 70** (overbought) on the hourly chart.
   * Enter short positions with even lots, set a desired stop-loss amount, and manage your position as follows:
      * Once the trade turns profitable, sell half the quantity equivalent to your stop-loss amount.
      * Let the remaining trade ride until the end of the day.
4. **Why Focus on Shorting in a Bear Market?**
   * This is an ideal bear market where **FIIs (Foreign Institutional Investors)** are consistently shorting.
   * There are **no strong reasons** to expect a market recovery anytime soon.",2025-01-27 05:19:21,1.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1ib0o72/its_a_beautiful_market_start_thinking_reverse/,StockMarketIndia

post,1gomh7h,"AsianPaints Marks Lowest Level Since 2021, Here's why i think!
",kzarraja,"The Q2 results showed that the net profit fell by 42.4%. The profit was ₹6.95 billion, which is lower than the street's expectation of ₹10.19 billion.

Asian Paints has been an underperformer, with a 26.2% drop compared to the Nifty's 11% rise YTD.

\- Sideways since Sep'21

\- Broken below the 200WEMA and range low of 2560

\- If 2510 holds on weekly basis, consolidation within the broad range might continue.

\- Next support is pegged at 2412.

post,1derz3u,Reached 1L profit in 1 year ,lifeofabaul,"I've been investing in stocks seriously since the past June. Had started with investing approx 25K in Adani enterprises as a bet for 2024 elections, but sold it in just one month with 500 rupees profit (could not handle the volatility), but by that time I had started getting interested in the basics of fundamental and technical analysis. I am not from a finance background but I am still trying my best to understand the concepts of finance (ROE, ROCE, ROA, cash flow statement, debt to equity etc.) mostly from YouTube channels (Basant Maheshwari, Invest in Bharat, etc). These are my stock picks in past 1 year. I would love to hear your views on my portfolio. The stocks did not perform well for the most of the year, and I was afraid that I won't even beat FD returns, however after election results things are changing for the better. My goal is to slowly concentrate the portfolio by reducing the companies to 9-10 in the next 3 years and keep investing for long term gains.

post,1golrqt,Asian Paints shares plunge 9% as brokerages sound the alarm over underwhelming Q2 results,Twinkling_Paw,"Asian Paints shares fell over 9 percent on November 11 after several brokerages expressed disappointment over the company's underwhelming Q2FY25 performance amid a challenging demand environment and increased competition.At 9:20 AM, the stock was down over 7 percent at Rs 2,565. Year-to-date, it has lost nearly 25 percent, underperforming the Nifty 50, which has risen 10 percent in the same period.JPMorgan downgraded Asian Paints to 'Underweight', cutting its target price to Rs 2,400 from Rs 2,800 due to the company's significant operating miss. The company's profit-before-depreciation, interest, and tax (PBDIT) margin dropped to 15.5 percent in Q2FY25 from 20.3 percent the previous year. CEO Amit Syngle said, ""Operating margins were impacted by the price reductions taken last year, higher material prices and increased sales expenses.""",2024-11-11 06:18:50,73.0,39.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1golrqt/asian_paints_shares_plunge_9_as_brokerages_sound/,IndianStreetBets
