post,1g0xuvh,What is happening in the uranium sector? + Break out of uranium price starting now (2 triggers) + uranium spot and LT price just started to increase,Napalm-1,"Hi everyone,

**A summery of a couple important points**

The uranium sector is in a growing global uranium supply deficit that can't be solved in a couple of years time, while:

* recently the biggest uranium producing country of the world, Kazakhstan, made a 17% cut in the previously promised production level for 2025 and also hinting on lower production levels for 2026 and beyond than previously hoped.
* followed by additional production cuts from other uranium producers (Uranium mining is hard)
* recently Putin started the threat of soon restricting uranium deliveries to the West, meaning Russian uranium, Russian enriched uranium, uranium from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan that goes through Russia to the port of Saint Petersburg.
* followed by Kazatomprom (Kazakhstan) stating that uranium deliveries to the West has become difficult and could become even more difficult in the future (--> Putin's threat)
* Microsoft paying for 100% of electricity from the Three Mile Island reactor they asked Constellation to restart in 2028 = That's unexpected additional uranium demand for delivery in 2025.
* Uranium demand is price inelastic
* The inventory created in 2011-2017 (when uranium sector was in oversupply) that helped to solve the structural global deficit starting early 2018, is now depleted! (Confirmed by UxC)

**A couple points more in detail:**

**A.** There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.

Let me explain

a) The gas price represents \~70% of total production cost of electricity coming from a gas-fired power plant. So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!

The uranium price only represents \~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105

b) the uranium spotprice is only for supply adjustments, while the main part of the uranium supply goes through LT contracts. So when an uranium consumer needs 50k lb uranium through a spot purchase in addition to the 450k lbs they got through an existing LT contract to be able to start the nuclear fuel rods fabrication, than they will just buy those 50k lb at any price, because blocking the start of the nuclear fuel rods fabrication is not an option.

c) buying uranium (example: 50k lb) at 150 USD/lb through the spotmarket, doesn't mean they need to buy 100% of their uranium needs at 150 USD/lb (example: 100% is 500k lb)

Those are the 3 main reasons why **uranium demand is price INelastic**

**B.** The evolution from oversupply in 2011-2017 to a structural global deficit since early 2018 and growing in the future

From 2011 till end 2017 the global uranium market was in oversupply which created an uranium inventory X (explained in a detailed 30 pages long report of mine in August 2023 where I calculated the creation of inventory X and the consumption of it starting early 2018)

Since early 2018 the global uranium market is in big structural deficit and this structural deficit will continue for the coming years for different reasons which have been consuming that inventory X

But now that inventory X is mathematically depleted. In previous high season (September 2023 - March 2024) we saw the first impact of that nearing depletion with the uranium spotprice going from 56 USD/lb in August 2023 to 106 USD/lb early February 2024

A good month ago a non-US utility went semi-public by sending an email to different uranium stakeholders in the world because they couldn't find 300,000 lb of uranium for delivery in October 2024. Not a surprise because inventory X is depleted now, and there aren't enough idle uranium productions left in the world to close the supply gap. And those few idle production capacities will take years to get back online.

300,000lb is not even enough to run one 1000 Mwe reactor for 1 year! The total global operational nuclear fleet capacity today is 395,388 Mwe

So now that that inventory X is depleted, the structural global uranium deficit has to be solved with a lot of new production that is't available.

How come?

During 2011-2020 not enough was invested in exploration and development of new uranium deposits, while existing uranium mines are nearing depletion.

An example: The biggest uranium project in the world is Arrow in Canada, but that projects needs at least 4 years of construction before it can produce the first pound of uranium, and the greenlight for the construction start hasn't been given yet.

The production start of other smaller uranium projects have been postponed:

* Dasa: postponed by 1 year from early 2025 to early 2026
* Phoenix: postponed by at least 2 years from 2025 to 2027 at the earliest

While producers are producing less than hopped: the majors Cameco, Kazaktomprom, Orano, CGN, Uranium One, ... but also Paladin Energy (2.5Mlb instead of 3.2Mlb planned for 2024), UR-Energy, ...

And at the demand side, the last 3+ years a lot of uranium reactors licences have been extended by an additional 20 years and even some by an additional 40 years. But that's a lot of unexpected additional uranium demand that the uranium sector haven't prepared for.

**C.** A couple weeks ago Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond

[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/j1tmr0xvu0ud1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04b6b501fe519f07552943f59eadc5cf396c7ed4)

My previous post goes more in detail on that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fhp6h5/different\_ways\_to\_tell\_utilities\_that\_biggest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fhp6h5/different_ways_to_tell_utilities_that_biggest/)

Conclusion of previous post:

**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce**. Meaning that they will soon all together try to buy uranium through the illiquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket (Uranium One) has less uranium to sell now.

And the less uranium producers deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket themself.

There is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy a significant volume of uranium in the illiquide spotmarket during the new high season in the uranium sector.

And before that production cut announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:

[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world](https://preview.redd.it/xzo37cg5v0ud1.jpg?width=534&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33ed5d7865621bca4c84cd1d9afdb5b12494f280)

With all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last couple of weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

We are at the beginning of the high season in the uranium sector.

**D.** On Sunday: The Zuuvch uranium mine of Orano is delayed by at least 2 years!

This was an important uranium project.

That's a loss of 14Mlb! (2\*7Mlb/y)

[Source: @z\_axis\_capital on X \(twitter\)](https://preview.redd.it/uw65uo08v0ud1.jpg?width=954&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fff037629c0b813bd8f972640ecce08d9f07c187)

Orano is a major uranium producers. They have a serious problem.

They lost uranium production in Niger in 2023/2024, they lost the Imouraren uranium project in Niger in 2024, and now this delay in production start of Zuuvch uranium mine.

Orano already had to buy uranium in the spotmarket to be able to honor their supply commitements. But now they will have to buy even more in the very tight uranium spotmarket

**E. 2 triggers (=> Break out of uranium price starting now imo)**

a) On October 1st the new uranium purchase budgets of US utilities will be released.

With all latest announcements (big production cuts from Kazakhstan, uranium supply warning from Kazatomprom, Putin's threat on restricting uranium supply to the West, UxC confirming that inventory X is now depleted, additional announcements of lower uranium production from other uranium suppliers the last week, ...), those new budgets will be significantly bigger than the previous ones.

b) The last \~6 months LT contracting has been largely postponed by utilities (only \~40Mlb contracted so far) due to uncertainties they first wanted to have clarity on.

Now there is more clarity. By consequence they will now accelerate the LT contracting and uranium buying

The upward pressure on the uranium spot and LT price is about to increase significantly

On October 2nd we got the first information of a lot of RFP's being launched!

**F. LT uranium supply contracts signed today are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**

Although the uranium spotprice is the price most investors look at, in the sector most of the uranium is delivered through LT contracts using a combination of LT price escalated to inflation and spot related price at the time of delivery.

Here the evolution of the LT uranium price:

[Source: Cameco](https://preview.redd.it/bd40kybfv0ud1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1cd91e13299041d7cd7e9f6995efd1d7e670c2d)

The global uranium shortage is structural and can't be solved in a couple of years time, not even when the uranium price would significantly increase from here, because the problem is the needed time to explore, develop and build a lot of new mines!

During the low season (around March till around September) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price weakens and the uranium spot price goes a bit down to be closer to the LT uranium price.

In the high season (around September till around March) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price increases again and the uranium spot price goes back up faster than the month over month price increase of the LT uranium price

The official LT price is update once a month at the end of the month.

**LT uranium supply contracts signed today (September) are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**

=> an average of 105 USD/lb

While the uranium LT price of end August 2024 was 81 USD/lb. Today TradeTech announced a new uranium LT price of 82 USD/lb, while Cameco announces a 81.5 LT uranium price of end September 2024.

By consequence there is a high probability that not only the uranium spotprice will increase faster coming weeks with activity picking up in the sector, but also that uranium LT price is going to jump higher in coming months compared to the 81.5 USD/lb of end September 2024.

Here is a fragment of a report of Cantor Fitzgerald written before the Kazak uranium supply warning, before the uranium supply threat from Putin, and before the additional cuts in 2024 productions from other uramium suppliers:

[Source: Cantor Fitzgerald, posted by John Quakes on X \(twitter\)](https://preview.redd.it/xwr98d0kv0ud1.jpg?width=528&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=797b8d24410580d5e48d866182ccdb7cbd7af626)

**G. Russia is preparing a long list of export curbs**

After the announcement of the huge (17%) cut in the planned production for 2025 and beyond of the biggest uranium producer of the world (Kazakhstan: \~45% of world production), now Putin asked his people to look into the possibilities to restrict some commodities export to the Western countries, explicitely mentioning uranium

[https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm](https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm)

**H. The uranium spot price increase that slowely started a week ago is now accelerating (some stakeholders have been frontrunning the 2 triggers starting previous week)**

Although the uranium LT price is much more important for the sector, most investors look at the uranium spotprice.

Uranium spotprice increase on Numerco:

[Source: Numerco website](https://preview.redd.it/5bcegcumv0ud1.jpg?width=607&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f3523ec8df724119fc854b770efd02759af0317)

**The ingredients for a uraniumsqueeze in the spotmarket are present**

What happens when uranium spotbuying increases, while the pounds of uranium available for spotselling decrease?

Causes:

a) Uranium One (100% production from Kazakhstan) producing less uranium than previously hoped by many (Utilities, Intermediaries, other producers). So less primary production to sell in spot

b) Inventory X, created in 2011-2017 that solved the annual primary deficit since early 2018, is now mathematically depleted. (Confirmed by UxC)

c) Utilities and Intermediaries increasing their minimum operational inventory levels due to the growing uranium supply insecurity => With supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others

Investors underestimate the impact of Russian threat alone. The threat alone (without effectively going through with it) is sufficient for utilities to go from supply security to supply insecurity.

Utilities and Intermediaries trade uranium between each other. But with supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others

**The last commercially available lbs will become unavailable before even being sold!** => Consequence: soon potential squeeze in spot

Break out higher of the uranium price is inevitable

And if Putin goes through with his threat, than the squeeze will be very big, knowing that uranium demand is price inelastic.



**I. A couple investment possibilities**

**Yellow Cake** (YCA on London stock exchange) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). **Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.**:

* With a YCA share price of 5.87 GBP/sh we buy uranium at \~75.69 USD/lb, while the uranium spotprice is at 83.50 USD/lb and LT uranium price of 81.5 USD/lb
* a YCA share price of 7.75 GBP/sh represents uranium at 100 USD/lb
* a YCA share price of 9.30 GBP/sh represents uranium at 120 USD/lb
* a YCA share price of 11.65 GBP/sh represents uranium at 150 USD/lb

And with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:

* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in uranium sector
* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNM.L): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNP.L): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Geiger Counter Limited (GCL.L): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Betashares Global Uranium ETF (URNM on ASX): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector



A couple individual uranium companies:

**Cameco** (CCJ on NYSE / CCO on TSX)

**Paladin Energy** (PDN on ASX) is significantly cheaper than Cameco and Paladin Energy doesn't have the construction/design risk of Cameco. Once Paladin Energy will be listed in the TSX (in coming weeks), I expect Paladin Energy to catch up to the valuation of TSX and NYSE listed uranium peers like Cameco, UR-Energy, Energy Fuels, ...

The shareholders of Fission Uranium Corp that has one of the highest grades well advanced Triple R deposit in the world (Canada) approved the takeover by Paladin Energy. And yesterday, the court also approved the takeover.

Paladin Energy and Fission Uranium Corp company combined will be a beast (Cash inflows from Langer Heinrich to finance the construction of Triple R), yet Paladin Energy and Fission Uranium Corp today are significantly cheaper on a EV/lb basis than respectively CCJ and NXE today.

**Deep Yellow** (DYL on ASX) and **Bannerman Energy** (BMN on ASX) have both beautiful projects and are very cheap on a EV/lb basis compared to peers like NXE, DNN, FCU, while both DYL and BMN have a lot of cash on their bank account today.

**Boss Energy** (BOE on ASX): uranium producers 100% owner of Honeymoon uranium mine and 30% owner of Alta Mesa

I am a novice in analysing companies so I was wondering if you guys could give in your opinion on this stock.

The stock is LT Foods which is the owner of brands like dawat and 85% of its revenue comes from selling rice.

35% revenue from USA, 30% India, 20% Europe and 15% miscellaneous.

The company has a PE of 21.8 as against Industry PE of 40 (as per screener)

Sales growth is at 14% and debt is very less

The inventory days are 190 (which I think is on the high side, isn't it?)

Overall it looks like a decent company, don't you guys think? And what could be the reason behind low PE? Crop uncertainty? Or anything else?",2024-10-07 15:18:06,3.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fya69x/lt_foods_daawat_rice_a_good_buy/,IndianStockMarket

By our estimate, my father doesn't know for sure, the beginging of the pf goes back to 1990, and we have some securities since then. My father did good that he understood the potential of it, when others around him didn't. How he got started is that he used to work in bank, and folks used to come to banks to get demand draft in 90s when applying for IPO (how things have changed!!) and he along with other members of staff also used to apply to few, the only difference was that if got allotted, my fathers colleague used to sell to get listing gains, and he used to just hang on to them. And, with time he got himself more educated, we still get ""Dalal street investment Journal"" since late 90s. Though, he never invested in mutual funds, which i am still unable to understand. In my 12th grade, i supplied whole class of 25 students of commerce section with annual reports, and when i was a kid i always used to judge companies by quality of their annual reports, and colgate was the most finely printed. 



Was my father an ""educated"" investor, probably not, if you throw words like EPS, bull, bear, correction, pullback, EBIDTA, half of the word he would not understand, let alone answer them, but what he subconsciously knew was his strength which was limited activity, he has never really sold any shares because ""price was down"", if you ask me have beaten the market (TWRR or IRR), i can't answer that, but what i can answer is that we have created a sizable corpus of securities which all the people in our social group has not, and this is simple long term effect of compounding. 



Some points

-We would be what you call as active-passive investor, we have investment in every kind, Mutual funds, index funds, stocks public and private, india and outside. 



-Since time immorial we have applied to IPOs and we have some failures and some spectuacular successes. Some IPO successes are HDFC, Genus Power (no one knew of this until 2 years and we held thru all the ""dark"" days), Divis, Dmart. Recent ones are Kaynes, Zomato, and most recent in Bajaj Housing finance. And, we not sold a single one of them, they may die on us but haven't sold. 



-Some failures, one in particular comes to mind is golden forest based out of Chandigarh which later turned out to be a ponzi scheme, and then there is YesBank, some sucking IPOs are paytm and CapitalSFB. 



-We have held some stocks so long that we don't know what the purchase date is or purchase price, reliance (went thru whole emotional cycle of Dhiru dying, brothers quarrel, ADAG and Jio, and now expected division into 3 companies), Colgate, LT, Videocon, which we was high flyer and then went private (Nayara) but we have held thru it. 



-For good or bad, we have always considered this PF as something which is like family ""darohar"" something which has to be passed onto generations, and we treat it like that, something to be not messed up. 



I am not saying this is best method or the only method, I am saying this is a method which we, in my opinion have achieved success. As they say play your own game. 



I'll end with a comment my father makes when we talk about frequent downturns in stocks ""'my name"" abhi to 1st inning hai, game ka result to 5th day ko pata chalega"". We have never graduated from 1st inning. 



If you have any questions feel free.

post,1jqfuff,How do investors earn regular money?,Hot-Cookie8465,"Hi investors. My straight forward question is - if one is a pure 'vanilla' investor who invests for long term basis - how do you earn regular income (not talking about salary etc.)? Not talking about option trading etc. Is the short term trading only way of building capital and sustenance - I mean one has to earn to survive also. How do you get out of the dilemma of ST vs LT income?

comment,1jqfuff,,,,,,,ml7jynq,None,"Debt simply means you lend someone 100 Rs for 5 years at 9% interest rate. The borrower pays you 9 Rs per year for 4 years. At the end of the 5th year, he returns you your Rs 100 along with Rs 9 for that years interest. Since there is no market linkage here and the 9% is contractual and obligatory by law, debt is used for income.

For example, all public sector companies and banks regularly borrow money from public via a debt instrument called 'bond'. They take say Rs 10 lakh from you for 10 years, promise you to pay 9% interest per year for 9 years, and in the 10th year they pay you 9% interest plus return your Rs 10 lakh they had borrowed.

A fixed deposit is the simplest bond between you and the bank. You lend your money to the bank for some interest for a fixed time period, and earn interest from them.

Since in case if debt instruments the interest rate payable by borrower, the final payment date, interest payment dates are all mentioned and are enforceable by law, AND they are not linked to equity markets, they are used for generating consistent income.

post,1exf5vm,"China just approved the construction of an additional 11 reactors, only problem there isn't enough global uranium production today and in the future ",Napalm-1,"Hi everyone,

1. Yesterday, China approved the construction of an additional 11 reactors

[Source: Bloomberg ](https://preview.redd.it/exelvx50oxjd1.jpg?width=992&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15123be923844f1b19b853e1c33576dfb87fcb61)

And now you will say to me that reactors take 20 years to be build ;-)

Well, in China not! China builds domestic reactors on time (in \~6 years time) and close to budget.

[Source: IAEA](https://preview.redd.it/medlc0k1oxjd1.jpg?width=618&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eac6d79b55e2a62247608e018347efe92e37f2f5)

Here are the reactors currently under construction (""start"" = Estimated year of grid connection)

Only problem, there isn't enough global uranium production today and not enough well advanced uranium projects to sufficiently increase global uranium production in the future.

https://preview.redd.it/iludsdzaoxjd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=180c992f111b0472d089f8267d2312d5a6629eba

2) We are at the end of the annual low season in the uranium sector. Soon we will entre the high season again

Uranium spotprice is close to the long term price again, like in August 2023 (end of low season in 2023), which creates a strong bottom for the uranium price

[Source: Cameco](https://preview.redd.it/ycqkf1ldoxjd1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb70fd945565b1cb4065cc38a2431f0caffc8e4f)

[Source: Skysurfer75 on X](https://preview.redd.it/6eozl9reoxjd1.jpg?width=1355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84479c38605a2dc798facf02dbdfbdab731bd6e4)

**Why a strong bottom for uranium price?**

Because it becomes very interesting to buy uranium in spotmarket to sell through existing LT contracts instead of doing all that effort to get more production ready asap.

Each time spotprice nears or is under the long term price, much more buyers of uranium in spot will appear

And we know that the global uranium sector is in a structural global deficit that can't be solved in 12 months time...

I'm strongly bullish for the uranium price in upcoming high season

The uranium price increase in 2H 2023 was a preview of a more important upward pressure on the uranium price in 2H 2024 (because inventory X is depleted)

**Bonus for the investor:** During the low season the discount over NAV of physical uranium funds, like Yellow Cake (YCA) become bigger, while in the uranium high season those discount become much smaller and even sometimes become premiums over NAV

Here what happened in the last part of the low season in 2023 (August 2023) with Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN, another physical uranium vehicle like YCA):

https://preview.redd.it/yxw0o8sioxjd1.jpg?width=1353&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d78339aa0c1235da05f8f18ad6cde7d12659ec1

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN) today:

Note 1: I post this now (end of low season), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season

Note 2: I'm currently increasing my uranium sector exposure in preparation for the upcoming high season in the sector

post,1g9eofo,Why Market Is Down Today?,SuperbHealth5023,"https://preview.redd.it/vdq61s2g6awd1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=8191c4f34d3929d58b0a0a7cfa42d0d95a12261e

The markets experienced a significant downturn on Tuesday as Hyundai Motors' IPO opened at a 1% discount, leading to declines in Indian benchmark indices. The Sensex fell by 931 points (-1.15%), meanwhile the Nifty dropped by 311.40 points (-1.26%). With 36 of the 50 stocks in the index trading in the red, BEL and Tata Motors were notable losers, although gains in ICICI Bank, Infosys, and Reliance Industries offered some support.

  
The market decline is driven by fears of a U.S. recession, escalating geopolitical tensions, weak corporate earnings, and concerns about stock overvaluation. Investors are engaging in profit booking, while Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have been selling shares amid global uncertainty. Additionally, SEBI's new regulatory changes on derivatives trading, rising crude oil prices, and concerns over upcoming U.S. economic data are adding to market volatility. Together, these factors are contributing to the downturn, prompting a cautious approach from investors.

If you have say 20 stocks in your portfolio and when you log in to your account, what parameters or values do you check?   
  
I would want to know how much LT or ST gain have I already booked in this FY and what is my current LT/ST gain/loss if I sold all my holdings of that stock today. I would also like to know what is my net as well as annualized gain/loss to see how am I doing. Is that what you look at too?

I mean, it is hard to remember how many and what price you purchased each stock at, and how many you have already sold. Does your broker account (I use sharekhan) show all the parameters that you are interested in or do you use your own excel or something to know what you want to know?

post,1h4pzlp,Have you ever eaten Mishtann foods basmati?,EnvironmentalFox3367,"I was analyzing Mishtann Foods' shares. The company claims to post 30%+ profits annually from basmati rice trading, outperforming industry leaders like LT Foods (Dawat) and KRBL (India Gate), which struggle to reach 10% margins. However, searching for Mishtann basmati mostly brings up stock-pumping YouTube videos, with little evidence of actual rice trading. Interestingly, the company was a cement firm (HICS) until 2015, not a rice trader since 1981 as claimed. Recently, they appointed Rashmika Mandanna as their brand ambassador, as per a SEBI circular, which adds to the confusion.

The numbers look solid. On paper.

The only thing that concerns me is the cash flow. It seems it's very easy for the company to sell their products on a good margin but all their sales are getting piled up as receivables. It seems hard for them to convert it into cash. Then there's instability on shareholding and not to mention promoters have sold 5% of their stake over the last quarter. Why'd they do that? FIIs are holding 5% though but no DIIs. (not the popular FIIs)

This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

My reason for picking these stocks (not all reasons apply to all stocks - these are just a few of the criteria) : 

- sales growth (i checked last 3 qtrs) 
- High promoter holding 
- EPS growth in a few stocks 
- Debt reduced, actively paying off
- Low debtor days, low inventory days
- High OPM (at least more than 25%) 
- Fairly decent reserves 
- Dividend payout 
- Share price growth over the last year.

post,1fneror,Review my low risk appetite portfolio (investments over past ~6 years),HawkNo1373,"Hi all

I have been in the markets for the past 6 years and have invested with an extremely low appetite. Of course I have churned my portfolio over the years, booked a lot of profits and reinvested the gains. I have a cash position of \~7L which is my ""opportunity fund"". The percentage in the ""unrealised gains"" column is actually XIRR (so you get an idea of how old the investment is).

My investments over the past 1 year I have marked with a red ""X"". Should I take more risks and allocate a bigger share of my portfolio to small caps?

comment,1fneror,,,,,,,lohzwek,None,"As I am myself consider myself to be consumer specific investor, I feel nestle and tata consumer could be ignored. I mean whatever growth you are looking, I think you can get a lot more by other fmcg shares rather than nestle and tata consumer. LT foods is nice bet which if goes well can make you good returns but still one strong fundamental that I would look for is itc. I know very controversial and many don't like it but the demerger will improve their balance sheet. Their current return on assets will improve too, since the current balance sheet contains huge capex of their hotel business too so we can evaluate better once the demerger happens. 

Tata consumer isn't bad stock either but at current levels or recent levels it is over valued and not sure how much returns expected from here. VBL is amazing buy!   
And Asian paints, margins will suffer for sure moving ahead and even I was holding it at good levels but I moved out from it and invested same amount in some other stock which is growing at faster rate. 

My main focus is on stock should not be that large that growth is minimal, I know risk should be managed too but still. That is just my perspective, everyone have their own style and I respect each one of the view as long as it has rationale behind it.

post,1hba0op,Dividend question,sfire2030,"Hello there, basic question: LT Foods announced a dividend of 0.5 INR per share. Please check the screenshot.  Tax rate is 10%. I received 651 INR, which is just 52% of the dividend amount. I’m not sure what the gross dividend is and why I received a lesser amount. Am I missing something?

post,1gzmpkp,GETTING YOUR TIMING RIGHT,Effective_Tour6961,"In the last post we discussed about how buying at average price can help you to mitigate risk.

Now here we will discuss about multiple time frame analysis.

We have already discussed about what is trend and how to use a trend in your favor in our first post if have not checked it you can find it in my profile.

TYPES OF TIME FRAMES

For our easy of understanding we can say there are two-time frames one is micro and the other one which is macro trend.

In simple terms the higher the time we choose in chart the healthy the trend will be.

still confusing??

https://preview.redd.it/h47d2apzm23e1.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d3ddcdf86a05d569eae458daa915283d6dc24b6

here we have chart of TCS

here we can see that the stock is moving in a healthy upside trend, after health rise it took its 20 ema support.

https://preview.redd.it/ubkr9i67n23e1.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa1983378ee64f1a62fd6feebbfa2b84b66d4a65

now this is the same chart but with weekly time frame here we have seen a good down trend for a while where the price breached the 20 ema.

It feels confusing on one side it is bullish and on other side its bearish what can we do here.



EK BREAK THO BANTA HAI

As we already know that market moves in waves, we have discussed it in our first post what is the reason behind this wave pattern.

see market never moves without any reason and does that means that if the market does not have any reason, it will fall no.

market takes buffer time and this time zones are nothing but a kind of buffer till the next thing hits either good or bad.

HOW TO USE IT.

see major trends are the power houses of market as badhe budhe kehgaye hai market upar hi jayega.

and smaller trends or smaller time frames are the one where we try to butcher each other speculate and get our dopamine high.

now we need to check the higher trend what it is where the rates are heading and once, we are comfortable with our decision we will focus on the war the smaller time frames.

there is no playbook for time frames 1month 1week but always remember higher is better.

 I have seen people predicting higher trends with help of lower trends but it's mostly vague on the other hand it is also true that micro trends will change the bigger trend.

But the problem here is in stats you will mostly fail in chasing changing trends, so it is wise to let the trend change and then take the trade no gun jumping in speculating trends.

post,1gu1sws,GUIDE TO TECHNICAL ANALYSIS PART 4 ,Effective_Tour6961,"In the previous post we discussed about what is support and how it works now we will talk about resistance.

Resistance is nothing but a level of price where it was rejected previously.

resistance helps you to understand where the share is taking a hit and which increased the odds of falling.

https://preview.redd.it/bco5e153ym1e1.png?width=1607&format=png&auto=webp&s=39b40d7781b04543ea1f22832398098e3200f545

here we have taken the chart of tcs as example we can see the first sell of was at 4000 level this is the weekly chart of tcs and which was followed back with a rise and rejection from same level.

if we overserve the resistance was broken after several weeks which was not a direct breach as we can see it took some healthy time of 4-5 weeks usually this type of breakout are seen at results months.

now note that the prices do not fall or rise when the results are out but prior to that as we assume that the market discounts everything but market can react highly negative when the results are way more below than the street anticipation for example we have seen how did indusind bank fell the bet on result is purely speculative unless you have some great sources.

alternate way to predict results is to follow it up with its peer for example there is delay between results of two companies if one company shows that the results are good you can assume that its peers would show the same. 

  
now moving one with resistance it would not be wise for you to trade at top as I have said earlier you cannot use just one thing to trade as other factors should be calculated.

now imagine if you had brought the stock as a low price, you would be aware where the sell may occur.

NOW WHERE TO BUY HOW TO BUY

  
THERE IS A CONCEPT CALLED REGRESSION TO MEAN.

  
now this concept will require a dedicated post which i am going to post soon.

in short 'mean' means avg.

https://preview.redd.it/vz9c8y7zzm1e1.png?width=1700&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b46147f53d9a13ffd7befe747764a7ed4d35a01

this is the same chart plotted on a 20 ema which is nothing but exponential moving average.

it is said that even if you gamble it's better to gamble at mean price.

look no matter how the stock falls or rise it always comes back to its mean which is the blue line.

  
We would discuss this topic in brief in my next post if you liked this post please share and follow for more.

more insights about the same are welcome.",2024-11-18 10:30:13,3.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gu1sws/guide_to_technical_analysis_part_4/,IndianStockMarket

post,1dqnojg,"End of Q1, how did you do this quarter? Share with me!",ProfessionalHot760,"Today marks the end of Q1 of 2024-25. It was a good roller coaster ride during these two months. Honestly, I expected more from me but I think I should look at the brighter side. When I say more, I mean I was expecting more profits from me but in such high volatility, I didn't give a single rupee in losses. Of course, I did make some bad decisions like IOC and LT but overall these were positive months. 

This Q1 I made a 25.2% return on my capital. Umm, it's good, but it's lower than my past performances. I saw huge running losses this Q1 (first time) but thanks to the guidance from the universe and my knowledge so far, I escaped almost all of it and didn't have to book any. This is the highlight of this quarter.

Interesting this is, that I joined the Reddit community this quarter only and have been enjoying the fun conversations here. Another highlight of the Q.

post,1fmnmea,Looking for suggestions to trim my portfolio,shankeybalwani,"I've holdings in 46 stocks I've been investing since 2019 and as I've learnt more during the last 5~ odd years, I understand having a long list of companies with little invested amounts doesn't make sense and want to trim the number of companies under 30.

I'm looking to do so by comparing a combination of ratios, but that's still so confusing and time consuming considering each industry has its own benchmark/ historical average.

Is there a free tool/ website that can help in comparison and ease my decision making?

post,1g359kq,A detailed overview of Bannerman Energy (BMN on ASX) ,Napalm-1,"Hi everyone,

Following my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g0xuvh/what\_is\_happening\_in\_the\_uranium\_sector\_break\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g0xuvh/what_is_happening_in_the_uranium_sector_break_out/)

Here is my detailed update of an uranium company: Bannerman Energy (BMN on ASX, BNNLF on US OTC):

https://preview.redd.it/48ebhqobmmud1.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aed1d703193773ad06cc1c45f8aee9743d883bb9

Here are a couple valuations of uranium companies in February 2007, when uranium spotprice was \~75USD/lb

https://preview.redd.it/urks0gremmud1.jpg?width=712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2400780a36744d4b8a893271652fc93556e9bee

  
1.85 EV/lb (BMN share price of 3.36 AUD/sh) compared to 16.02 EV/lb (FSY in February 2007) =>16.02/1.85 = 8.66x => BMN has multi-bagger potential, even more because they have a lot of cash on their books.

A 3x for the patient investor taking advantage of the broader market uncertainties at the moment impacting all stocks is not an exaggerated potential in LT.

Some additional information:

I am new here and started investing 8-10 months ago. Thought of sharing my journey, why did I pick what I picked etc.
Would love to hear what are the mistakes I am doing and what are the right strategies that I applied (if any) 

HDFC Bank - Bought in May. Was looking for some large cap company, largely influenced by Akshat S plus confidence on HDFC influence on Banking :) 

Asian Paints - Bought in May, Was looking for large cap company. Found mention somewhere. Did some analysis, historical performance and market leader in the sector. 

Unicomm eSolution - Did analysis, business performance was good. Working in ecomm domain was able to related to their business. Management looked solid. Was lucky to get 1 lot of IPO. 

LT Foods - Bought in April and then further addition during some dip in Aug/Sep. Was exploring consumer business, found its mention. Did analysis, got to know that they own Dawat Brand. Post Aug result, got to know their plan of expansion in Europe and other countries and hence continue to add few in dips

Inox Wind - Found its mention in some channel. Explored the business. Bullish on sector for long term. Performance looked good, with Suzlon being too much in news, thought of this as a good alternate


Medi Assist - Largest 3PA in insurance. Didn’t have any other insurance domain stock. Lucky to get IPO lot


Premier Energies - Bought in Sep. Was exploring from IPO. Business looked strong, sector is growing. Didn’t get IPO but bought it 2-3 days later


IEX - Don’t remember, probably influence by some YouTuber

CDSL - Bought in Aug. Largely due to FOMO. Was getting mentioned everywhere. Also thought that with lot of people like me exploring stock marker they probably will have good potential


Dhanuka, Kaveri - Bought in July. Post budget started exploring Agri industry. Fundamentals looked strong.

ONGC - PSU and green energy

Indus Tower - Influenced by a YouTuber

ITC - Exploring consumer business, Found mention somewhere. Given their strong business was convinced that it will perform good

Tata Steel - Low P/E, good brand

Apart from this purchased and sold IREDA (Was very new in the market, got 4x gain and saw stock going down for a week and sold it)
Motilal, RVNL - Had invested small amount, made some gain, sold to invest in other stocks
MTAR - Bought in FOMO, mentioned in some article, purchased without any analysis. Made 16% loss, sold it to reinvest in other stocks",2024-09-11 04:43:03,5.0,3.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fe1zu4/my_portfolio_analysis/,IndianStockMarket

post,1fhp6h5,"Different ways to tell utilities that biggest uranium producing country (~45% of world production) in world is sold out & will supply significantly less than previously promised + Putin yesterday: ""Hi western countries, we could restrict uranium supply to you""",Napalm-1,"Hi everyone,

After the succes my previous post 26days ago had: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1exf5vm/china\_just\_approved\_the\_construction\_of\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1exf5vm/china_just_approved_the_construction_of_an/)

Here new important events in the sector:

**A.** Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond

[Source: Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/v9t3q5gtr1pd1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a74027b088ccb242881c59a9f0ad19ad0549164)

About the subsoil Use agreements that are about to be adapte to a lower production level:

[Source: Kazatomprom \(Kazakhstan\)](https://preview.redd.it/0u3fbqfyr1pd1.jpg?width=881&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc1a4ecf1bb2561843165c053d01653c81ce757f)

Here are the production figures of 2022 (not updated yet, numbers of 2023 not yet added here):

[Source: World Nuclear Association](https://preview.redd.it/cp6g9j8or1pd1.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6692f84101f7ceb19c57f2fec9b4dcb68aaa9941)

**Problem is that:**

a) Kazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge. Actually when comparing with the oil sector, Kazakhstan is more like Saudi Arabia, Russia and USA combined, because Saudi Arabia produced 11% of world oil production in 2023, Russia also 11% and USA 22%.

b) The production of 2025-2028 was already fully allocated to clients! Meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or Kazatomprom & JV partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket. But from whom exactly?

All the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce (They are all short uranium). Cause: Many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing LT contracts that had that option integrated in the contract, forcing producers to supply more uranium. But those uranium producers aren't able increase their production that way.

c) The biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is Uranium One. And 100% of uranium of Uranium One comes from? ... well from Kazakhstan!

Conclusion:

**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce (Because they are forced to by their clients through existing LT contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients)**. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.

And the less they deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket.

There is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy more uranium in the spotmarket.

And that while uranium demand is price INelastic!

And before that announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:

[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world](https://preview.redd.it/hx8zmmr4s1pd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ee7610264bc59a394d2b28d1762780771450730)

**B.** September 10th, 2024: Kazakhstan starting to tell western utilities that they will get less uranium supply then they hoped.

[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/axnam2pcs1pd1.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e15f3e1ad905cf173639fa62a6f9d73aadf2da0d)

**C.** September 11th, 2024: Putin suggesting to restrict uranium supply to the West

[Source: Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/eud7thkos1pd1.jpg?width=986&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6cd7eede70976216e12e5dc71ac767c970ec85fe)

This threat is sufficient for western utilities to lose the last perception of security of uranium supply

Russia is an important supplier of uranium and even more of enriched uranium for Europe and USA.

The possible loss of Russian enriched uranium supply is actually a bigger problem, because Russia is responsible for \~40% of world enrichment services. The biggest part of uranium from Kazakhstan and Russia for Europe and USA is first enriched in Russia.

Uranium to Europe:

[Source: Euratom](https://preview.redd.it/3hqxuwqus1pd1.jpg?width=919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cebb02a489cb576252e2098d2c7936b2bc42cd3)

Uranium to USA:

[Source: EIA](https://preview.redd.it/4dd56nqxs1pd1.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ddc5a7f641040279b07591c26645d3e8db8bf64)

And besides that. There are 2 routes for uranium from Kazakhstan to the West: the Saint-Petersburg route and the Caspian route

But Kazaktomprom just said a day earlier that the Caspian route was much more costely and that the supply of uranium to the West has become very difficult (point B.)

When looking at the numbers, this threat is an electroshock for Western utilities (USA, Europe, South Korea, Japan)

Utilities will assess this additional news now, and most probably accelerate and increase the uranium purchases in coming weeks and months in preparation for possible export restrictions by Russia for uranium.

In terms of revenue, uranium and enriched uranium revenues are significantly smaller than their oil and gas revenues.

Important comment: The uranium spotmarket is not like the copper, gold, oil market.

a) The uranium spotmarkte is an iliquid market. Sometimes you don't have a transaction for a couple days, so an uranium spotprice not moving each day in the low season is normal. In the high season the number of transactions increase in the uranium spotmarket.

b) The uranium spotmarket doesn't react instantly on news, like a liquid copper, gold, oil market does. In the uranium sector the few actors with access to the uranium spotmarket take their time to analyse data before starting to act.

**D.** A couple investment options

**Yellow Cake** (YCA on London stock exchange) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.:

* With a YCA share price of 5.30 GBP/sh (current YCA price) we buy uranium at 67.85 USD/lb, while the uranium spotprice is at 79.50 USD/lb and LT uranium price of 81 USD/lb
* a YCA share price of 7.80 GBP/sh represents uranium at 100 USD/lb
* a YCA share price of 9.35 GBP/sh represents uranium at 120 USD/lb
* a YCA share price of 11.75 GBP/sh represents uranium at 150 USD/lb

**Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.

A share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at \~23.75 CAD/share or \~17.50 USD/sh gives you a discount to NAV of 11.20 %

An uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \~40.00 CAD/sh or \~29.60 USD/sh.

And with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:

* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in uranium sector
* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNM.L): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNP.L): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Geiger Counter Limited (GCL.L): 100% invested in uranium sector

Note 1: I post this now (at the gradual start of high season in the uranium sector), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector. We are now gradually entering the high season again. Previous 2 weeks were calm, because everyone of the uranium and nuclear industry was at the World Nuclear Symposium in London (September 4th - 6th, 2024), and the week after the utilities started assessing all the new information they got from Kazakhstan, Russia and the WNA Symposium. Now they are analysing the market again and prepare for uranium purchases in coming weeks and months.

post,1f26frx,"Kazatomprom announcement on Friday after ASX close: 17% cut in expected production 2025 in Kazakhstan, the Saudi Arabia of uranium + hinting on additional production cuts for 2026 and beyond",Napalm-1,"Hi everyone,

My previous post is just 6 days old ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1exf5vm/china\_just\_approved\_the\_construction\_of\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1exf5vm/china_just_approved_the_construction_of_an/) )

and a major event happened Friday after the close of the ASX with important instant impact on the uranium market:

Kazatomprom announced \~17% cut in the previously hoped uranium production 2025 from Kazakhstan + hinting on additional cuts for 2026 and beyond, because they announced they would ask the government to reduce existing subsoil use agreements of a couple existing uranium mines, meaning reducing the annual production range of those mines.

[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/rh97d8dob4ld1.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=537d222c80e541155ec2941f9385948aa8e6618e)

About the subsoil Use agreements that are about to be adapte to a lower production level:

[Source: Kazatomprom](https://preview.redd.it/5o6w8f4sb4ld1.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf5952445eb78b684fe4b63db72378b0270352b)

**Problem is that:**

a) Kazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge.



b) The production of 2025-2028 was already fully allocated to clients! Meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or Kazatomprom & JV partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket. But from whom exactly?

All the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce (They are all short uranium). Cause: Many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing LT contracts that had that option integrated in the contract, forcing producers to supply more uranium. But those uranium producers aren't able increase their production that way.



c) The biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is Uranium One. And 100% of uranium of Uranium One comes from? ... well from Kazakhstan!

Important to know here is that uranium demand is price INelastic!

Utilities don't care if they have to buy uranium at 80 or 150 USD/lb, as long as they get enough uranium and ON TIME

Conclusion:



Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.

Before the announcement of Kazakhstan on Friday, the global uranium supply problem already looked like this:

Uranium company shares and uranium funds are traded on the NYSE, TSX, ASX, London Stock exchange

comment,1ddzmcu,,,,,,,l89nocc,SaChikuMahi_07,"Great start to investing with a capital of Rs. 1 lakh.  
However, I find 2 things contrasting in your query:

1. You want a bunch of people on reddit to recommend stocks, it may serve you well just because of the luck factor but this isn't a sustainable approach. I'd recommend doing your own research, put in the hard work and then make at the most 2 informed picks. You will feel a sense of accountability with the results you get but most importantly you will learn more about the research process, the macro picture currently influencing the market and the sectors that may emerge strong. There is a high possibility that you will come out wiser through this approach. 

2. If your holding period is 3-6 months, fundamentals do not matter, in fact I would question if stocks is even an avenue to consider. I would rather park it in a short term liquid fund if I'd need the capital in 3-6 months.

As Charlie Munger aptly puts it, never interrupt compounding unnecessarily.

If you do not need the capital, let it do its work for the coming 20-25-30 years, you will be pleasantly surprised how much this can grow into. However, if your need for capital is immediate in the next 6 months, do not invest in the markets. You will also attract STCG in case you make any gains.

Just my 2 cents to your query. I hope it helps you.",2024-06-12 13:37:24,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ddzmcu/stocks_suggestion/,IndianStockMarket

Car manufacturers, airlines, Furniture retailers, clothing, hotels & restaurants etc, do good when the economy is doing good (Higher consumer spending). So during difficult times like Recession these stocks see decline in sales, while Counter/Anti cyclical stocks like FMCG, LPG, Power etc, give good returns during tough times; You can observe that many Power stocks have performed very well in last 2-3 years, like one of my friend bought Coal India for 181 in July 2022 and it tripled up in 2 years. In short, these are High risk, High reward stocks where entry and exit price matters the most, so a blend of both Cyclical/Counter(defensive) stocks with calculated entry-exit price can give good returns, yet i'd suggest to pick stocks with good fundamentals (Sales might vary according to different economic periods) so that it can be safe to hold it for little long if it doesn't move as expected.",2024-09-26 05:43:31,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1fp154d/do_you_have_any_of_these_in_your_portfolio/,StockMarketIndia

Its foreign market is what makes it even more trustable. They own more than 60% of Zambia's largest coal mining company Maamba. FIIs and DIIs have increased their holding. Looking at the amount you've invested in this, should be ok with holding it for long or at least for 3-4 months. If it is a short term / swing trade, first target would be 1280 then 1350. (Just a suggestion if it's a swing trade, Don't put big amounts in short term trades). Even if it's a Mid/Long term investment, distribute your capital among different stocks from various sectors. Diversify your portfolio for effective risk control.

post,1h6c7wq,Have you ever eaten Mishtann foods basmati rice?,EnvironmentalFox3367,"
I was analyzing Mishtann Foods' shares. The company claims to post 30%+ profits annually from basmati rice trading, outperforming industry leaders like LT Foods (Dawat) and KRBL (India Gate), which struggle to reach 10% margins. However, searching for Mishtann basmati mostly brings up stock-pumping YouTube videos, with little evidence of actual rice trading. Interestingly, the company was a cement firm (HICS) until 2015, not a rice trader since 1981 as claimed. Recently, they appointed Rashmika Mandanna as their brand ambassador, as per a SEBI circular, which adds to the confusion. So, the real question is—have you ever eaten this rice? #MISHTANN

Intention of this post is simple. I'm interested to invest in this stock. But I am unable to find a single customer who has ever used this product.

Just in (info came in \~30 min before the end of the trading day in USA/Canada)! The biggest uranium mine, Priargunsky mine, in Russia started to flood today.

https://preview.redd.it/djo2quzm4lle1.jpg?width=846&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b4127f9811e0a2c0e530e1a4715d5736aa95c02

\~2000tU = \~5.2 Mlb/y, so not a small mine

A couple uranium companies and funds.

Paladin Energy (PDN.AX on ASX and PDN.TO on TSX) is an uranium producers with their Langer Heinrich mine that also owns one of the highest grades uranium deposits in the world, namely Patterson Lake South in Canada.

Paladin Energy is significantly cheaper on a EV/lb basis than Cameco at the moment.

PDN got a TSX listing a 2 months ago. With TSX and NYSE listed uranium companies having a much higher EV/lb valuation, it is expected that PDN share price will start a rerate higher to TSX/NYSE valuation.

Lotus Resources (LOT on ASX): they own the Kayelekera Uranium mine. They are in the process of restarting that mine by Q3 2025. First delivery to clients in 2026. They are fully funded. They signed a couple LT uranium supply contracts with future clients. But they still have \~80% of future uranium output available for future new contracts (very important for utilities and other uranium producers short in uranium production (Cameco, Kazatomprom, Orano, ...)

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN (CAD) on TSX and U.U (USD) on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium, trading at their lows of 2024/2025. Here investors are not subjected to mining related risks, because here the investor just buys the commodity.

Yellow Cake (YCA on London stock exchange) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium, trading at their lows of 2024/2025. Here investors are not subjected to mining related risks, because here the investor just buys the commodity.

Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM on NYSE)

Alternative on ASX: Betashares Global Uranium ETF (URNM on ASX)

Global X Uranium ETF (URA on NYSE)

post,1fe1wd3,My Portfolio Analysis,Background_While4971,"I am new here and started investing 8-10 months ago. Thought of sharing my journey, why did I pick what I picked etc.
Would love to hear what are the mistakes I am doing and what are the right strategies that I applied (if any) 

HDFC Bank - Bought in May. Was looking for some large cap company, largely influenced by Akshat S plus confidence on HDFC influence on Banking :) 

Asian Paints - Bought in May, Was looking for large cap company. Found mention somewhere. Did some analysis, historical performance and market leader in the sector. 

Unicomm eSolution - Did analysis, business performance was good. Working in ecomm domain was able to related to their business. Management looked solid. Was lucky to get 1 lot of IPO. 

LT Foods - Bought in April and then further addition during some dip in Aug/Sep. Was exploring consumer business, found its mention. Did analysis, got to know that they own Dawat Brand. Post Aug result, got to know their plan of expansion in Europe and other countries and hence continue to add few in dips

Inox Wind - Found its mention in some channel. Explored the business. Bullish on sector for long term. Performance looked good, with Suzlon being too much in news, thought of this as a good alternate


Medi Assist - Largest 3PA in insurance. Didn’t have any other insurance domain stock. Lucky to get IPO lot


Premier Energies - Bought in Sep. Was exploring from IPO. Business looked strong, sector is growing. Didn’t get IPO but bought it 2-3 days later


IEX - Don’t remember, probably influence by some YouTuber

CDSL - Bought in Aug. Largely due to FOMO. Was getting mentioned everywhere. Also thought that with lot of people like me exploring stock marker they probably will have good potential


Dhanuka, Kaveri - Bought in July. Post budget started exploring Agri industry. Fundamentals looked strong.

ONGC - PSU and green energy

Indus Tower - Influenced by a YouTuber

ITC - Exploring consumer business, Found mention somewhere. Given their strong business was convinced that it will perform good

Tata Steel - Low P/E, good brand

Apart from this purchased and sold IREDA (Was very new in the market, got 4x gain and saw stock going down for a week and sold it)
Motilal, RVNL - Had invested small amount, made some gain, sold to invest in other stocks
MTAR - Bought in FOMO, mentioned in some article, purchased without any analysis. Made 16% loss, sold it to reinvest in other stocks",2024-09-11 04:37:18,1.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1fe1wd3/my_portfolio_analysis/,StockMarketIndia

post,1g3x2cg,What is happening in the uranium sector? + Break out of uranium price starting now (2 triggers) + uranium spot and LT price just started to increase ,Napalm-1,"Hi everyone,

**A summery of a couple important points**

The uranium sector is in a growing global uranium supply deficit that can't be solved in a couple of years time, while:

* recently the biggest uranium producing country of the world, Kazakhstan, made a 17% cut in the previously promised production level for 2025 and also hinting on lower production levels for 2026 and beyond than previously hoped.
* followed by additional production cuts from other uranium producers (Uranium mining is hard)
* recently Putin started the threat of soon restricting uranium deliveries to the West, meaning Russian uranium, Russian enriched uranium, uranium from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan that goes through Russia to the port of Saint Petersburg.
* followed by Kazatomprom (Kazakhstan) stating that uranium deliveries to the West has become difficult and could become even more difficult in the future (--> Putin's threat)
* Microsoft paying for 100% of electricity from the Three Mile Island reactor they asked Constellation to restart in 2028 = That's unexpected additional uranium demand for delivery in 2025.
* Uranium demand is price inelastic
* The inventory created in 2011-2017 (when uranium sector was in oversupply) that helped to solve the structural global deficit starting early 2018, is now depleted! (Confirmed by UxC)

**A couple points more in detail:**

**A.** There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.

Let me explain

a) The gas price represents \~70% of total production cost of electricity coming from a gas-fired power plant. So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!

The uranium price only represents \~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105

b) the uranium spotprice is only for supply adjustments, while the main part of the uranium supply goes through LT contracts. So when an uranium consumer needs 50k lb uranium through a spot purchase in addition to the 450k lbs they got through an existing LT contract to be able to start the nuclear fuel rods fabrication, than they will just buy those 50k lb at any price, because blocking the start of the nuclear fuel rods fabrication is not an option.

c) buying uranium (example: 50k lb) at 150 USD/lb through the spotmarket, doesn't mean they need to buy 100% of their uranium needs at 150 USD/lb (example: 100% is 500k lb)

Those are the 3 main reasons why **uranium demand is price INelastic**

**B.** The evolution from oversupply in 2011-2017 to a structural global deficit since early 2018 and growing in the future

From 2011 till end 2017 the global uranium market was in oversupply which created an uranium inventory X (explained in a detailed 30 pages long report of mine in August 2023 where I calculated the creation of inventory X and the consumption of it starting early 2018)

Since early 2018 the global uranium market is in big structural deficit and this structural deficit will continue for the coming years for different reasons which have been consuming that inventory X

But now that inventory X is mathematically depleted. In previous high season (September 2023 - March 2024) we saw the first impact of that nearing depletion with the uranium spotprice going from 56 USD/lb in August 2023 to 106 USD/lb early February 2024

A good month ago a non-US utility went semi-public by sending an email to different uranium stakeholders in the world because they couldn't find 300,000 lb of uranium for delivery in October 2024. Not a surprise because inventory X is depleted now, and there aren't enough idle uranium productions left in the world to close the supply gap. And those few idle production capacities will take years to get back online.

300,000lb is not even enough to run one 1000 Mwe reactor for 1 year! The total global operational nuclear fleet capacity today is 395,388 Mwe

So now that that inventory X is depleted, the structural global uranium deficit has to be solved with a lot of new production that is't available.

How come?

During 2011-2020 not enough was invested in exploration and development of new uranium deposits, while existing uranium mines are nearing depletion.

An example: The biggest uranium project in the world is Arrow in Canada, but that projects needs at least 4 years of construction before it can produce the first pound of uranium, and the greenlight for the construction start hasn't been given yet.

The production start of other smaller uranium projects have been postponed:

* Dasa: postponed by 1 year from early 2025 to early 2026
* Phoenix: postponed by at least 2 years from 2025 to 2027 at the earliest

While producers are producing less than hopped: the majors Cameco, Kazaktomprom, Orano, CGN, Uranium One, ... but also Paladin Energy (2.5Mlb instead of 3.2Mlb planned for 2024), UR-Energy, ...

And at the demand side, the last 3+ years a lot of uranium reactors licences have been extended by an additional 20 years and even some by an additional 40 years. But that's a lot of unexpected additional uranium demand that the uranium sector haven't prepared for.

**C.** A couple weeks ago Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond

[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/v6ecworsutud1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0965b6668f1383292afe46f75892cbaee2c6f64a)

About the subsoil Use agreements that are about to be adapte to a lower production level:

[Source: Kazatomprom \(Kazakhstan\)](https://preview.redd.it/jqtenv3zutud1.jpg?width=881&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06b2a48926558ae899ef0a50b929a2fcbb450d2a)

Here are the production figures of 2022 (not updated yet, numbers of 2023 not yet added here):

[Source: World Nuclear Association](https://preview.redd.it/cocfyz02vtud1.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95ccf250c87bd01e5fa18d2b379e5b980007c93c)

**Problem is that:**

a) Kazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge. Actually when comparing with the oil sector, Kazakhstan is more like Saudi Arabia, Russia and USA combined, because Saudi Arabia produced 11% of world oil production in 2023, Russia also 11% and USA 22%.

b) The production of 2025-2028 was already fully allocated to clients! Meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or Kazatomprom & JV partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket. But from whom exactly?

All the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce (They are all short uranium). Cause: Many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing LT contracts that had that option integrated in the contract, forcing producers to supply more uranium. But those uranium producers aren't able increase their production that way.

c) The biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is Uranium One. And 100% of uranium of Uranium One comes from? ... well from Kazakhstan!

Conclusion:

**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce (Because they are forced to by their clients through existing LT contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients)**. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.

And the less they deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket.

There is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy more uranium in the spotmarket.

And that while uranium demand is price INelastic!

And before that announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:

[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world](https://preview.redd.it/ja3az2o6vtud1.jpg?width=534&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbf890af6211497796c364f0d8208802123d995d)

With all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last couple of weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

We are at the beginning of the high season in the uranium sector.

**D.** On Sunday: The Zuuvch uranium mine of Orano is delayed by at least 2 years!

This was an important uranium project.

That's a loss of 14Mlb! (2\*7Mlb/y)

[Source: @z\_axis\_capital on X \(twitter\)](https://preview.redd.it/gcf2z6c9vtud1.jpg?width=954&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=541747caaad8159f4e0e98924b44b86b47b2ce8a)

Orano is a major uranium producers. They have a serious problem.

They lost uranium production in Niger in 2023/2024, they lost the Imouraren uranium project in Niger in 2024, and now this delay in production start of Zuuvch uranium mine.

Orano already had to buy uranium in the spotmarket to be able to honor their supply commitements. But now they will have to buy even more in the very tight uranium spotmarket

**E. 2 triggers (=> Break out of uranium price starting now imo)**

a) On October 1st the new uranium purchase budgets of US utilities will be released.

With all latest announcements (big production cuts from Kazakhstan, uranium supply warning from Kazatomprom, Putin's threat on restricting uranium supply to the West, UxC confirming that inventory X is now depleted, additional announcements of lower uranium production from other uranium suppliers the last week, ...), those new budgets will be significantly bigger than the previous ones.

b) The last \~6 months LT contracting has been largely postponed by utilities (only \~40Mlb contracted so far) due to uncertainties they first wanted to have clarity on.

Now there is more clarity. By consequence they will now accelerate the LT contracting and uranium buying

The upward pressure on the uranium spot and LT price is about to increase significantly

On October 2nd we got the first information of a lot of RFP's being launched!

**F. LT uranium supply contracts signed today are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**

Although the uranium spotprice is the price most investors look at, in the sector most of the uranium is delivered through LT contracts using a combination of LT price escalated to inflation and spot related price at the time of delivery.

Here the evolution of the LT uranium price:

[Source: Cameco](https://preview.redd.it/m1amt6ecvtud1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cef116f249f054677790437866bd70750e9fb852)

The global uranium shortage is structural and can't be solved in a couple of years time, not even when the uranium price would significantly increase from here, because the problem is the needed time to explore, develop and build a lot of new mines!

During the low season (around March till around September) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price weakens and the uranium spot price goes a bit down to be closer to the LT uranium price.

In the high season (around September till around March) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price increases again and the uranium spot price goes back up faster than the month over month price increase of the LT uranium price

The official LT price is update once a month at the end of the month.

**LT uranium supply contracts signed today (September) are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**

=> an average of 105 USD/lb

While the uranium LT price of end August 2024 was 81 USD/lb. Today TradeTech announced a new uranium LT price of 82 USD/lb, while Cameco announces a 81.5 LT uranium price of end September 2024.

By consequence there is a high probability that not only the uranium spotprice will increase faster coming weeks with activity picking up in the sector, but also that uranium LT price is going to jump higher in coming months compared to the 81.5 USD/lb of end September 2024.

Here is a fragment of a report of Cantor Fitzgerald written before the Kazak uranium supply warning, before the uranium supply threat from Putin, and before the additional cuts in 2024 productions from other uramium suppliers:

[Source: Cantor Fitzgerald, posted by John Quakes on X \(twitter\)](https://preview.redd.it/7jjtrpyevtud1.jpg?width=528&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3632ab79002d3000f07688d79041f44532b9d834)

**G. Russia is preparing a long list of export curbs**

After the announcement of the huge (17%) cut in the planned production for 2025 and beyond of the biggest uranium producer of the world (Kazakhstan: \~45% of world production), now Putin asked his people to look into the possibilities to restrict some commodities export to the Western countries, explicitely mentioning uranium

[https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm](https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm)

**H. The uranium spot price increase that slowely started a week ago is now accelerating (some stakeholders have been frontrunning the 2 triggers starting now)**

Although the uranium LT price is much more important for the sector, most investors look at the uranium spotprice.

Uranium spotprice increase recently:

[Source: Numerco website](https://preview.redd.it/awcel6govtud1.jpg?width=607&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dd7780804af0e4fde0fe1e4581c8c30aee979a7)

**The ingredients for a uraniumsqueeze in the spotmarket are present**

What happens when uranium spotbuying increases, while the pounds of uranium available for spotselling decrease?

Causes:

a) Uranium One (100% production from Kazakhstan) producing less uranium than previously hoped by many (Utilities, Intermediaries, other producers). So less primary production to sell in spot

b) Inventory X, created in 2011-2017 that solved the annual primary deficit since early 2018, is now mathematically depleted. (Confirmed by UxC)

c) Utilities and Intermediaries increasing their minimum operational inventory levels due to the growing uranium supply insecurity => With supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others

Investors underestimate the impact of Russian threat alone. The threat alone (without effectively going through with it) is sufficient for utilities to go from supply security to supply insecurity.

Utilities and Intermediaries trade uranium between each other. But with supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others

**The last commercially available lbs will become unavailable before even being sold!** => Consequence: soon potential squeeze in spot

Break out higher of the uranium price is inevitable

And if Putin goes through with his threat, than the squeeze will be very big, knowing that uranium demand is price inelastic.

**I. A couple investment possibilities**

**Yellow Cake** (YCA on London stock exchange) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). **Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.**:

* With a YCA share price of 5.87 GBP/sh we buy uranium at \~75.69 USD/lb, while the uranium spotprice is at 83.50 USD/lb and LT uranium price of 81.5 USD/lb
* a YCA share price of 7.75 GBP/sh represents uranium at 100 USD/lb
* a YCA share price of 9.30 GBP/sh represents uranium at 120 USD/lb
* a YCA share price of 11.65 GBP/sh represents uranium at 150 USD/lb

And with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:

* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in uranium sector
* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNM.L): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNP.L): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Geiger Counter Limited (GCL.L): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Betashares Global Uranium ETF (URNM on ASX): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector

A couple individual uranium companies:

**Cameco** (CCJ on NYSE / CCO on TSX)

**Paladin Energy** (PDN on ASX) is significantly cheaper than Cameco and Paladin Energy doesn't have the construction/design risk of Cameco. Once Paladin Energy will be listed in the TSX (in coming weeks), I expect Paladin Energy to catch up to the valuation of TSX and NYSE listed uranium peers like Cameco, UR-Energy, Energy Fuels, ...

The shareholders of Fission Uranium Corp that has one of the highest grades well advanced Triple R deposit in the world (Canada) approved the takeover by Paladin Energy. And yesterday, the court also approved the takeover.

Paladin Energy and Fission Uranium Corp company combined will be a beast (Cash inflows from Langer Heinrich to finance the construction of Triple R), yet Paladin Energy and Fission Uranium Corp today are significantly cheaper on a EV/lb basis than respectively CCJ and NXE today.

**Deep Yellow** (DYL on ASX) and **Bannerman Energy** (BMN on ASX) have both beautiful projects and are very cheap on a EV/lb basis compared to peers like NXE, DNN, FCU, while both DYL and BMN have a lot of cash on their bank account today.

**Boss Energy** (BOE on ASX): uranium producers 100% owner of Honeymoon uranium mine and 30% owner of Alta Mesa

post,1kc0ba2,Top 10 Market-Moving News for Indian Stocks (2025-05-01),ecofaille,"Here's a quick rundown of the top news that could impact Indian stock markets today:

1.  **Dixon Technologies Enters Joint Venture with Inventec:** Aims to manufacture Notebooks and Servers in India. Dixon will hold 60% equity, while Inventec will hold the remaining 40% in Dixon IT Devices Private Limited. This is a major boost for 'Make in India' and could significantly impact Dixon's revenue.

2.  **Sandur Manganese & Iron Ores Gets Green Light for Iron Ore Production Expansion:** KSPCB approves expansion of iron ore production at ML No. 2678 from 3.81 MTPA to 4.36 MTPA. This is a positive step for SMIORE, potentially leading to increased sales volume and revenue in the coming years.

3.  **Varun Beverages Announces Interim Dividend Payout!:** VBL declares an interim dividend of ₹0.50 per equity share. Record date is May 7, 2025, and payment starts May 9, 2025.

4.  **PVR INOX Expands Footprint:** Opens a new 4-screen multiplex in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, marking its debut in the city. This expansion reflects the growing demand for quality cinema experiences in smaller cities and aligns with the company's strategy to bring premium entertainment to new markets.

5.  **HPCL and ADNOC Trading Forge Landmark LNG Supply Agreement:** HPCL enters into an LNG Trading Supply Agreement with ADNOC Trading, bolstering India's energy security. The LNG will be processed at HPCL's newly commissioned Chhara LNG Terminal.

7.  **Bodhitree Multimedia Enters High-Concept Content Creation with Madlab Alpha Launch!:** Madlab Alpha Private Limited is launched as a subsidiary of Bodhitree Multimedia Limited and is set to deliver a slate of projects that resonate far beyond India’s borders.

This demerger could lead to better focus and efficiency for both the remaining business of Genus Power Infrastructures Ltd and the newly formed Genus Prime Infra Ltd, potentially unlocking value for shareholders.

10. **Gland Pharma Secures USFDA Approval for Latanoprostene Bunod Ophthalmic Solution:** Gland Pharma receives USFDA approval for its generic version of VYZULTA, targeting a $171 million market with 180-day exclusivity.

post,1e6bqxe,[Taxes on Trading] What are the chances of getting notice for not using FIFO?,fap_fap_fap_fapper,"Basically I have long-term holdings e.g. Infy bought at say 400 years ago.

Last year I traded Infy buy 1200 sell 1300. All cash market (delivered to demat, sold few days later).

I made only 100 (tax 15) but according to FIFO, my gain is 900 Long term (tax 90).

The  total gain in trading is around 2L but broker's FIFO report is showing  14L because last year the shares really shot up from my buy price years  ago.

The mistake I made was not opening separate demat account for trading, have done it this year.

For last year, I'm tending towards paying tax only on 2L ST and not 13L LT (don't even have the amount, will have to sell more shares!)

What  are the chances of getting a notice? Do they monitor broker's data  against tax returns? And if I explain the one-to-one correspondence of  trades (e.g. old holdings are 1748 shares, trade is clear buy 100 shares  sell 100 shares), what are the chances they will accept?

post,1ejvw1g,What stocks do you invest in regularly (SIP)?,avinashbaheti,"
What stocks do you invest in regularly (SIP)?

My top three picks would be:

1. ITC Limited
2. Tips Industries Limited
3. PNGS Gargi Fashion Jewellery Limited

The rationality behind these picks is growth over momentum. ITC Limited is a stock that holds the portfolio together in bad times. The dividend yield is also pretty impressive. Though it is a very old enterprise, I still believe that it has potential to grow and deliver decent returns. I hope the proposed demerger unlocks wealthy to investor.

Tips Industries Limited is a cash rich company that rewards regularly by way of dividends and buy-backs. The music industry is growing and people have started to pay for streaming it. There is some stability in revenues as the company has minimum guarantee deals with global record labels. By demerging the films division, the risk is transferred to the new company, making music the core business for the company. I also think their accounting practices are conservative as 100% costs are written-off in the year of release, thereby keeping the balance sheet light weight.

PNGSGFJ Limited is by far the riskiest amongst the three. It is still a relatively small and new company (market capitalization is less than ₹1,000 crores), yet poised for growth. The name P.N. Gadgil & Sons is a symbol of excellence and trust. The company enjoys this brand legacy. The organized jewellery business is slowly taking over mom-and-pop stores. As a society we are experiencing more women participation in the work force. This leaves women with more disposable income that will further boost the jewellery business. This company is rapidly expanding its physical presence across tier 1 cities. Consumers desire affordable, high quality, fashionable accessories and this company checks all the boxes.

I am eager to know your picks for SIP. That's my two cents, thank you.",2024-08-04 13:58:17,9.0,8.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1ejvw1g/what_stocks_do_you_invest_in_regularly_sip/,IndianStreetBets

post,1g4o2pa,A detailed overview of Bannerman Energy (BMN on ASX),Napalm-1,"Hi everyone,

Following my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1g3x2cg/what\_is\_happening\_in\_the\_uranium\_sector\_break\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1g3x2cg/what_is_happening_in_the_uranium_sector_break_out/)

Here is my detailed update of an uranium company: Bannerman Energy (BMN on ASX, BNNLF on US OTC):

https://preview.redd.it/1tf1mw6ku0vd1.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bd2eaffe5e54381381dae4391706b70e54426d2

Here are a couple valuations of uranium companies in February 2007, when uranium spotprice was \~75USD/lb

https://preview.redd.it/pjv1zj8nu0vd1.jpg?width=712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91a998967b86fc8576c62d510e14413a219aaf55

1.93 EV/lb (BMN share price of 3.50 AUD/sh) compared to 16.02 EV/lb (FSY in February 2007) =>16.02/1.93 = 8.30x => BMN has multi-bagger potential, even more because they have a lot of cash on their books.

A 3x for the patient investor taking advantage of the broader market uncertainties at the moment impacting all stocks is not an exaggerated potential in LT.

Some additional information:

post,1g5qvu8,What is happening in the uranium sector? + Break out of uranium price starting now (2 triggers) + uranium spot and LT price just started to increase ,Napalm-1,"Hi everyone,

**A summery of a couple important points**

The uranium sector is in a growing global uranium supply deficit that can't be solved in a couple of years time, while:

* recently the biggest uranium producing country of the world, Kazakhstan, made a 17% cut in the previously promised production level for 2025 and also hinting on lower production levels for 2026 and beyond than previously hoped.
* followed by additional production cuts from other uranium producers (Uranium mining is hard)
* recently Putin started the threat of soon restricting uranium deliveries to the West, meaning Russian uranium, Russian enriched uranium, uranium from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan that goes through Russia to the port of Saint Petersburg.
* followed by Kazatomprom (Kazakhstan) stating that uranium deliveries to the West has become difficult and could become even more difficult in the future (--> Putin's threat)
* Microsoft paying for 100% of electricity from the Three Mile Island reactor they asked Constellation to restart in 2028 = That's unexpected additional uranium demand for delivery in 2025.
* Google signing nuclear energy contract with Kairos PowerKairos Power (October 14th, 2024)
* Amazon goes nuclear, to invest more than $500 million to develop small modular reactorsAmazon goes nuclear, to invest more than $500 million to develop small modular reactors (October 16th, 2024)
* Uranium demand is price inelastic
* The inventory created in 2011-2017 (when uranium sector was in oversupply) that helped to solve the structural global deficit starting early 2018, is now depleted! (Confirmed by UxC)

**A couple points more in detail:**

**A.** There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.

Let me explain

a) The gas price represents \~70% of total production cost of electricity coming from a gas-fired power plant. So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!

The uranium price only represents \~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105

b) the uranium spotprice is only for supply adjustments, while the main part of the uranium supply goes through LT contracts. So when an uranium consumer needs 50k lb uranium through a spot purchase in addition to the 450k lbs they got through an existing LT contract to be able to start the nuclear fuel rods fabrication, than they will just buy those 50k lb at any price, because blocking the start of the nuclear fuel rods fabrication is not an option.

c) buying uranium (example: 50k lb) at 150 USD/lb through the spotmarket, doesn't mean they need to buy 100% of their uranium needs at 150 USD/lb (example: 100% is 500k lb)

Those are the 3 main reasons why **uranium demand is price INelastic**

**B.** The evolution from oversupply in 2011-2017 to a structural global deficit since early 2018 and growing in the future

From 2011 till end 2017 the global uranium market was in oversupply which created an uranium inventory X (explained in a detailed 30 pages long report of mine in August 2023 where I calculated the creation of inventory X and the consumption of it starting early 2018)

Since early 2018 the global uranium market is in big structural deficit and this structural deficit will continue for the coming years for different reasons which have been consuming that inventory X

But now that inventory X is mathematically depleted. In previous high season (September 2023 - March 2024) we saw the first impact of that nearing depletion with the uranium spotprice going from 56 USD/lb in August 2023 to 106 USD/lb early February 2024

A good month ago a non-US utility went semi-public by sending an email to different uranium stakeholders in the world because they couldn't find 300,000 lb of uranium for delivery in October 2024. Not a surprise because inventory X is depleted now, and there aren't enough idle uranium productions left in the world to close the supply gap. And those few idle production capacities will take years to get back online.

300,000lb is not even enough to run one 1000 Mwe reactor for 1 year! The total global operational nuclear fleet capacity today is 395,388 Mwe

So now that that inventory X is depleted, the structural global uranium deficit has to be solved with a lot of new production that is't available.

How come?

During 2011-2020 not enough was invested in exploration and development of new uranium deposits, while existing uranium mines are nearing depletion.

An example: The biggest uranium project in the world is Arrow in Canada, but that projects needs at least 4 years of construction before it can produce the first pound of uranium, and the greenlight for the construction start hasn't been given yet.

The production start of other smaller uranium projects have been postponed:

* Dasa: postponed by 1 year from early 2025 to early 2026
* Phoenix: postponed by at least 2 years from 2025 to 2027 at the earliest

While producers are producing less than hopped: the majors Cameco, Kazaktomprom, Orano, CGN, Uranium One, ... but also Paladin Energy (2.5Mlb instead of 3.2Mlb planned for 2024), UR-Energy, ...

And at the demand side, the last 3+ years a lot of uranium reactors licences have been extended by an additional 20 years and even some by an additional 40 years. But that's a lot of unexpected additional uranium demand that the uranium sector haven't prepared for.

**C.** Recently, Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond

[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/p1r4r8o2gbvd1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4966e48a3ef2a484e7ec40726be933c4483d3f35)

Kazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge. Actually when comparing with the oil sector, Kazakhstan is more like Saudi Arabia, Russia and USA combined, because Saudi Arabia produced 11% of world oil production in 2023, Russia also 11% and USA 22%.

Here my previous post explaining this more in detail: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f4usq8/kazatomprom\_17\_cut\_in\_expected\_production2025\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f4usq8/kazatomprom_17_cut_in_expected_production2025_in/)

Conclusion of my previous post:

**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce (Because they are forced to by their clients through existing LT contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients)**. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.

And the less they deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket.

There is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy more uranium in the spotmarket.

And that while uranium demand is price INelastic!

And before that announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:

[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world](https://preview.redd.it/296cyxmggbvd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75a342266e636b38894d9a9d6a4e76d54bb6e917)

With all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last couple of weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

We are at the beginning of the high season in the uranium sector.

**D.** On Sunday: The Zuuvch uranium mine of Orano is delayed by at least 2 years!

This was an important uranium project.

That's a loss of 14Mlb! (2\*7Mlb/y)

[Source: @z\_axis\_capital on X \(twitter\)](https://preview.redd.it/xt83g4skgbvd1.jpg?width=954&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c87f248dacacb1030cb7992d892dd35757cfbc3)

Orano is a major uranium producers. They have a serious problem.

They lost uranium production in Niger in 2023/2024, they lost the Imouraren uranium project in Niger in 2024, and now this delay in production start of Zuuvch uranium mine.

Orano already had to buy uranium in the spotmarket to be able to honor their supply commitements. But now they will have to buy even more in the very tight uranium spotmarket

**E. UR-Energy and Olympic Dam also producing less uranium than promised**

[Source: UR-Energy](https://preview.redd.it/6lyulp7mhbvd1.jpg?width=816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cba60ff5ac957274a5544159219499eef410b833)

**F. 2 triggers (=> Break out of uranium price starting now imo)**

a) On October 1st the new uranium purchase budgets of US utilities will be released.

With all latest announcements (big production cuts from Kazakhstan, uranium supply warning from Kazatomprom, Putin's threat on restricting uranium supply to the West, UxC confirming that inventory X is now depleted, additional announcements of lower uranium production from other uranium suppliers the last week, ...), those new budgets will be significantly bigger than the previous ones.

b) The last \~6 months LT contracting has been largely postponed by utilities (only \~40Mlb contracted so far) due to uncertainties they first wanted to have clarity on.

Now there is more clarity. By consequence they will now accelerate the LT contracting and uranium buying

The upward pressure on the uranium spot and LT price is about to increase significantly

On October 2nd we got the first information of a lot of RFP's being launched!

**G. LT uranium supply contracts signed today are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**

Although the uranium spotprice is the price most investors look at, in the sector most of the uranium is delivered through LT contracts using a combination of LT price escalated to inflation and spot related price at the time of delivery.

Here the evolution of the LT uranium price:

[Source: Cameco](https://preview.redd.it/yr1qk8nngbvd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5296a0df1d8d0edca64ced1306d1f6bae041c307)

The global uranium shortage is structural and can't be solved in a couple of years time, not even when the uranium price would significantly increase from here, because the problem is the needed time to explore, develop and build a lot of new mines!

During the low season (around March till around September) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price weakens and the uranium spot price goes a bit down to be closer to the LT uranium price.

In the high season (around September till around March) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price increases again and the uranium spot price goes back up faster than the month over month price increase of the LT uranium price

The official LT price is update once a month at the end of the month.

**LT uranium supply contracts signed today (September) are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**

=> an average of 105 USD/lb

While the uranium LT price of end August 2024 was 81 USD/lb. Today TradeTech announced a new uranium LT price of 82 USD/lb, while Cameco announces a 81.5 LT uranium price of end September 2024.

By consequence there is a high probability that not only the uranium spotprice will increase faster coming weeks with activity picking up in the sector, but also that uranium LT price is going to jump higher in coming months compared to the 81.5 USD/lb of end September 2024.

Here is a fragment of a report of Cantor Fitzgerald written before the Kazak uranium supply warning, before the uranium supply threat from Putin, and before the additional cuts in 2024 productions from other uramium suppliers:

[Source: Cantor Fitzgerald, posted by John Quakes on X \(twitter\)](https://preview.redd.it/zjxstfaqgbvd1.jpg?width=528&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f77ac4be79a8d4bf9934ec8db306f24d6e420c98)

**H. Russia is preparing a long list of export curbs**

After the announcement of the huge (17%) cut in the planned production for 2025 and beyond of the biggest uranium producer of the world (Kazakhstan: \~45% of world production), now Putin asked his people to look into the possibilities to restrict some commodities export to the Western countries, explicitely mentioning uranium

[https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm](https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm)

**I. The uranium spot price increase that slowely started 3 weeks ago is now going to accelerate**

Although the uranium LT price is much more important for the sector, most investors look at the uranium spotprice.

The uranium spotprice is now at 83.25 USD/lb

**The ingredients for a uraniumsqueeze in the spotmarket are present**

What happens when uranium spotbuying increases, while the pounds of uranium available for spotselling decrease?

Causes:

a) Uranium One (100% production from Kazakhstan) producing less uranium than previously hoped by many (Utilities, Intermediaries, other producers). So less primary production to sell in spot

b) Inventory X, created in 2011-2017 that solved the annual primary deficit since early 2018, is now mathematically depleted. (Confirmed by UxC)

c) Utilities and Intermediaries increasing their minimum operational inventory levels due to the growing uranium supply insecurity => With supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others

Investors underestimate the impact of Russian threat alone. The threat alone (without effectively going through with it) is sufficient for utilities to go from supply security to supply insecurity.

Utilities and Intermediaries trade uranium between each other. But with supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others

**The last commercially available lbs will become unavailable before even being sold!** => Consequence: soon potential squeeze in spot

Break out higher of the uranium price is inevitable

And if Putin goes through with his threat, than the squeeze will be very big, knowing that uranium demand is price inelastic.

**J. A couple investment possibilities**

**Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). **Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.**

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust website: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)

The uranium LT price just increased to 81.50 USD/lb, while uranium spotprice started to increase the last couple of trading days of previous week.

Uranium spotprice is now at 83.25 USD/lb

A share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at 28.14 CAD/share or 20.46 USD/sh represents an uranium price of 83.25 USD/lb

For instance, before the production cuts announced by Kazakhstan and before Putin's threat too restrict uranium supply to the West, Cantor Fitzgerald estimated that the uranium spotprice will reach 120 USD/lb, 130 USD/lb in 2025 and 140 USD/lb in 2026. Knowing a couple important factors in the sector today (UxC confirming that inventory X is indeed depleted now) find this estimate for 2024/2025 modest, but ok.

An uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \~40.50 CAD/sh or \~29.50 USD/sh.

And with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:

* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the uranium sector
* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector
* Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector
* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector

I posting now, in the beginning of the high season in the uranium sector that started in September and that will now hit the accelerator (Oct 1st), and not 2 months later when we will be well in the high season

post,1i7d7p3,Ex-Joby Exec Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Scott Howell Joins Archer Defense – A Vote of No Confidence in Joby’s Military Efforts? 🚀,Additional_Pea131,"Big news in the eVTOL space: Archer Aviation (ACHR) has announced that Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Scott Howell, previously an advisor to Joby Aviation, is joining their Defense Advisory Board to advance Archer's next-gen military program. This move not only boosts Archer’s credibility but might also signal Howell's lack of confidence in Joby’s ability to deliver on military initiatives. Let’s break this down:

# Why Lt. Gen. Howell’s Switch is Significant:

1️⃣ **Ex-Joby Military Advisor:** Howell’s decision to leave Joby and align with Archer speaks volumes. Joby has stopped or failed to deliver on military-related work, leaving Howell to pivot toward a company he likely sees as having better potential in the defense space.

2️⃣ **Military Expertise:** As a former leader of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), Howell brings decades of military experience to Archer. His involvement signals serious intent to position Archer’s eVTOLs for defense applications, including battlefield logistics, search & rescue, and rapid transport.

3️⃣ **Credibility Boost for Archer:** Howell's endorsement of Archer over Joby strengthens Archer’s narrative as a leader in both commercial and defense markets. It suggests Archer’s tech and strategy may be better suited to meet the stringent demands of military use.

# What This Could Mean for ACHR Stock:

* **Short-term:** Investors may interpret Howell’s move as a direct vote of confidence in Archer’s ability to deliver where Joby couldn’t, likely leading to increased optimism around ACHR’s stock.
* **Long-term:** The defense market offers large, multi-year contracts that could add a steady, high-margin revenue stream for Archer. If Howell’s experience and connections can secure key deals, it could significantly bolster the company’s financials.

# My Optimistic Take:

This isn’t just about one man—it’s about what his shift represents. Joby’s apparent failures in military programs may have opened the door for Archer, and Howell’s decision to join them reinforces the idea that Archer is better positioned to succeed. Combined with their commercial partnerships (like United Airlines), Archer seems to be diversifying intelligently, increasing their chances of dominating the eVTOL race.

**TL;DR:** Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Scott Howell, formerly an advisor to Joby Aviation, has joined Archer’s Defense Advisory Board. His move signals confidence in Archer’s military potential and highlights Joby’s failures in the defense space. This could open new revenue streams and cement Archer as a key player in the eVTOL industry.

What’s your take on this move? Are we looking at the next big step for ACHR?",2025-01-22 15:09:37,6.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1i7d7p3/exjoby_exec_lt_gen_ret_scott_howell_joins_archer/,StockMarket

post,1ewxhyj,"China just approved the construction of an additional 11 reactors, only problem there isn't enough uranium production today and in the future",Napalm-1,"Hi everyone,

1. Yesterday, China approved the construction of an additional 11 reactors

https://preview.redd.it/n2j5raravtjd1.png?width=992&format=png&auto=webp&s=e90e439b7ea3fa323d232c63b961a535c8cff879

And now you will say to me that reactors take 20 years to be build ;-)

Well, in China not! China builds domestic reactors on time (in \~6 years time) and close to budget.

Only problem, there isn't enough global uranium production today and not enough well advanced uranium projects to sufficiently increase global uranium production in the future.

2) We are at the end of the annual low season in the uranium sector. Soon we will entre the high season again

Uranium spotprice is close to the long term price again, like in August 2023 (end of low season in 2023), which creates a strong bottom for the uranium price

[Source: Cameco](https://preview.redd.it/li99y80dztjd1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a02a09ca22f9f7c62ccb42dc255ad53f05abcc9)

**Why a strong bottom for uranium price?**

Because it becomes very interesting to buy uranium in spotmarket to sell through existing LT contracts instead of doing all that effort to get more production ready asap.

Each time spotprice nears or is under the long term price, much more buyers of uranium in spot will appear

And we know that the global uranium sector is in a structural global deficit that can't be solved in 12 months time...

I'm strongly bullish for the uranium price in upcoming high season

The uranium price increase in 2H 2023 was a preview of a more important upward pressure on the uranium price in 2H 2024 (because inventory X is depleted)

**Bonus for the investor:** During the low season the discount over NAV of physical uranium funds, like Yellow Cake (YCA) become bigger, while in the uranium high season those discount become much smaller and even sometimes become premiums over NAV

Here what happened in the last part of the low season in 2023 (August 2023) with Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN, another physical uranium vehicle like YCA):

China aims to get

1/3 through acquisitions (examples: 90% Husab, 25% Langer Heinrich, 66% Rossing all 3 mines in Namibia)

1/3 through LT contracts with uranium producers abroad

And they hope the get 1/3 through future domestic mines, but they don't have a lot of uranium deposits that can be mined economically. 

Today their domestic production is just under 5 million lb/year from a couple small very deep uranium mines

5 million lb/year is good for just 10 chinese reactors. They have 56 reactors working today and aim to more than 3x their current nuclear capacity by 2035

And for shits and giggles, take a wild guess at which brokerage firm was leading the charge at pumping out the biggest pieces of financial shit—shit that was so stinky and had structures so utterly toxic that when they finally imploded, they would make the financial landscape so radioactive that it would be uninhabitable by human investors for the next twenty years?



Yes, you got it: Goldman Sachs.



Employing a strategy that they would come to perfect over the next hundred years, Goldman had started off slowly, and then once they were sure that the massive financial windfall would outweigh the financial mass destruction that was sure to follow, they jumped in with both feet first and became the industry’s most prolific creator of its biggest pieces of shit.",2025-04-07 15:23:35,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1jtnvio/roller_coaster_day_for_the_markets/,StockMarket

post,1fp3hwg,"The upward pressure on the uranium price is about to increase significantly (2 triggers) + uranium production is hard: a lot of cuts in hoped uranium production for 2024, 2025 and beyond",Napalm-1,"Hi everyone,

**A. 2 triggers**

a) Next week the new uranium purchase budgets of US utilities will be released.

With all latest announcements (big production cuts from Kazakhstan, uranium supply warning from Kazatomprom, Putin's threat on restricting uranium supply to the West, UxC confirming that inventory X is now depleted, additional announcements of lower uranium production from other uranium suppliers the last week, ...), those new budgets will be significantly bigger than the previous ones.

b) The last \~6 months LT contracting has been largely postponed by utilities (only \~40Mlb contracted so far) due to uncertainties they first wanted to have clarity on.

Now there is more clarity. By consequence they will now accelerate the LT contracting and uranium buying

Today LT contracts are being signed with a 80 - 85 USD/lb floor and a 125 - 130 USD/lb ceiling escalated with future inflation! This will soon be reflected in significant LT uranium price increases.

The upward pressure on the uranium price is about to increase significantly

Yesterday the uranium spotprice started to move higher after more than a week of no movement, and it just moved higher again now. Now at 80.85 USD/lb.

**B. Uranium mining is hard!**

UR-Energy: The production of uranium in restarting deposits is fraught with difficulties and challenges. Future production will fall short of what the market discounts as certain. Just an example, URG's production will be 43% lower than its first 1Q2024 guidance

[Source: UR-Energy](https://preview.redd.it/gt444v748yqd1.jpg?width=816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91d42c0d3512b5deaf1c297f406cf3fac896ab43)

Me: The available alternatives: deliverying less uranium to the clients than previously promised or buying uranium in spot

But URG is not alone!

Kazakhstan did 17% cut for their promised uranium production2025 + lower production than expected in 2026 & beyond! My previous post explaining this more in detail: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f4usq8/kazatomprom\_17\_cut\_in\_expected\_production2025\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f4usq8/kazatomprom_17_cut_in_expected_production2025_in/)

Langer Heinrich too! \~2.5Mlb production in 2024, in2023 they promised 3.2Mlb for 2024

Dasa delayed by 1y (>4Mlb less for 2025), Phoenix by 2y

Peninsula Energy planned to start production end 2023, but with what UEC dis to PEN, the production of PEN was delayed by a year => Again less pounds in 2024 than initially expected. Peninsula Energy is in the process to restart ISR production end this year.

BOE EU and UUUU (good, cashflow generating, companies) also didn’t reach the amounts of uranium production for Q1, Q2 & Q3 2024 promised in previous years.

**C.** Physical uranium without being exposed to mining related risks

**Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust website: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)

The uranium LT price at 81 USD/lb, while uranium spotprice started to increase yesterday.

A share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at 27.00 CAD/share or 20.01 USD/sh represents an uranium price of 81 USD/lb

For instance, before the production cuts announced by Kazakhstan and before Putin's threat too restrict uranium supply to the West, Cantor Fitzgerald estimated that the uranium spotprice will reach 120 USD/lb, 130 USD/lb in 2025 and 140 USD/lb in 2026. Knowing a couple important factors in the sector today (UxC confirming that inventory X is indeed depleted now) find this estimate for 2024/2025 modest, but ok.

An uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \~40.00 CAD/sh or \~29.50 USD/sh.

And with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

**D.** A couple alternatives:

**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:

* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the uranium sector
* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector
* Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector
* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector

Here is a fragment of a report of Cantor Fitzgerald written before the Kazak uranium supply warning, before the uranium supply threat from Putin, and before the additional cuts in 2024 productions from other uramium suppliers:

[Source: Cantor Fitzgerald, posted by John Quakes on X \(twitter\)](https://preview.redd.it/s5b94k4k8yqd1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=df034d9e059d9af5d0209af97f1b57b264d40515)

And today LT contracts are indeed being signed with a 80 - 85 USD/lb floor and a 125 - 130 USD/lb ceiling escalated with future inflation! => an average price \~105 USD/lb

Those higher LT prices contracted as we speak will soon be reflected in significant LT uranium price increases.

Cameco LT uranium price today:

Note: I post this now at the beginning of the high season in the uranium sector and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector. We are now gradually entering the high season again. Previous 3 weeks were calm, because everyone of the uranium and nuclear industry was at the World Nuclear Symposium in London (September 4th - 6th, 2024), and the 2 weeks after the utilities started assessing all the new information they got from Kazakhstan, Russia and the WNA Symposium. Now they are analysing the market again and prepare for uranium purchases in coming weeks.

post,1ffs76p,Putin asking to look at the possibilities to restrict uranium supply from Russia to the West. What are the implications of such a threat? Looking at the numbers + 1 day earlier: Kazakhstan clearly stating that uranium supply to the West has become very difficult (They are sold out for coming years),Napalm-1,"Hi everyone,

For those interested. No need to rush. Take time to double check the information I'm giving here, before potentially doing something.

**A.** Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond

Explained in more detail in my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f4usq8/kazatomprom\_17\_cut\_in\_expected\_production2025\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f4usq8/kazatomprom_17_cut_in_expected_production2025_in/)

Conclusion:

Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.

Before the announcement of Kazakhstan on Friday, the global uranium supply problem already looked like this:

[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world](https://preview.redd.it/veiqfmohzjod1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ba80761363fabd5d0ff68a81f0ca1487a7d08ad)

**B.** 3 days ago: Kazakhstan starting to tell western utilities that they will get less uranium supply then they hoped.

[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/8x040xujzjod1.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e1f295dd80d53916e847b1bbf375404fd48bbb3)

**C.** 2 days ago: Putin suggesting to restrict uranium supply to the West

[Source: Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/xzdhhn210kod1.jpg?width=986&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79541378c508ea4f4c8c102625f08f9efb118caf)



This threat is sufficient for western utilities to lose the last perception of security of uranium supply

Why?

a) Russia is an important supplier of uranium and even more of enriched uranium for Europe and USA.

The possible loss of Russian enriched uranium supply is actually a bigger problem, because Russia is responsible for \~40% of world enrichment services. The biggest part of uranium from Kazakhstan and Russia for Europe and USA is first enriched in Russia.

Uranium to Europe:

[Source: Euratom](https://preview.redd.it/sxjme9bnzjod1.jpg?width=919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e09e074d09f21e224f545d6a2e80e8923e738a78)

Uranium to USA:

[Source: eia](https://preview.redd.it/94htvzgpzjod1.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=43c135230b07a1f85147a1d56aa3e1ff035d641e)

b) And besides that. There are 2 routes for uranium from Kazakhstan to the West: the Saint-Petersburg route and the Caspian route

And because most uranium from Kazakhstan for Europe, USA, Japan and South Korea need to be enriched in Russia, because the West has a shortage in enrichment capacity, the biggest part of Kazak uranium supply to Europe, USA, Japan and South Korea is also threatened.

There was a reason why Europe was sanctioning oil en gas from Russia and not uranium from Russia!

But Kazaktomprom just said a day earlier that the Caspian route was much more costely and that the supply of uranium to the West has become very difficult (point B.)

When looking at the numbers, this threat is an electroshock for Western utilities (USA, Europe, South Korea, Japan)

Utilities will assess this additional news now, and most probably accelerate and increase the uranium purchases in coming weeks and months in preparation for possible export restrictions by Russia for uranium.

In terms of revenue, uranium and enriched uranium revenues are significantly smaller than their oil and gas revenues.



**D.** A couple investment possibilities

**Yellow Cake** (YCA on London stock exchange) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.:

* With a YCA share price of 5.30 GBP/sh (current YCA price) we buy uranium at 67.85 USD/lb, while the uranium spotprice is at 80 USD/lb and LT uranium price of 81 USD/lb
* a YCA share price of 7.80 GBP/sh represents uranium at 100 USD/lb
* a YCA share price of 9.35 GBP/sh represents uranium at 120 USD/lb
* a YCA share price of 11.75 GBP/sh represents uranium at 150 USD/lb

**Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.

[Sprott website](https://preview.redd.it/g20j7vad8kod1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=3df0caf9a5d7a25c64429fca512bd7a86ff20da3)

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust is trading at a discount to NAV at the moment. Imo, not for long anymore.

A share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at \~24.30 CAD/share or \~17.95 USD/sh gives you a discount to NAV of 9.00 %

An uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \~40.00 CAD/sh or \~29.60 USD/sh.

And with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:

* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in uranium sector
* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector
* Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector
* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNM.L): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNP.L): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Geiger Counter Limited (GCL.L): 100% invested in uranium sector

**Uranium Royalty Corp** (URC / UROY): the only Royalty and streaming company in the uranium sector physical uranium and annual uranium deliveries from current productions

  
Note 1: Uranium demand is price INelastic due to different factors. Utilities don't care if they have to buy some uranium pounds at 80 USD/lb or at 150 USD/lb, as long as they get enough uranium delivered ON TIME.

Note 2: the uranium spotmarkte is an iliquid market. Sometimes you don't have a transaction for a couple days, so an uranium spotprice not moving each day in the low season is normal. In the high season the number of transactions increase in the uranium spotmarket.

Note 3: I post this now (at the beginning of high season in the uranium sector), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector. We are now gradually entering the high season again. Previous week was calm, because everyone of the uranium and nuclear industry was at the World Nuclear Symposium in London (September 4th - 6th, 2024). Now they are coming back to their desk and start to analyse the market again and prepare for uranium purchases in coming weeks and months.

  
For those interested. No need to rush. Take time to double check the information I'm giving here, before potentially doing something.

Imo, not for long anymore",Napalm-1,"Hi everyone,

Now that the NVDA earnings are out, and investors can again look beyond that...

After my post of 10 days ago ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ewxhyj/china\_just\_approved\_the\_construction\_of\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ewxhyj/china_just_approved_the_construction_of_an/) ), a major production cut for production 2025 and beyond has been announced.

The uranium sector is in a global structural supply deficit, and now Kazakhstan, responsible for \~45% of world production, announced a big cut in the hoped uranium production for 2025 and hinted for additional cuts in 2026 and beyond.

A. There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.

Let me explain

a) The gas price represents \~70% of total production cost of electricity coming from a gas-fired power plant. So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!

The uranium price only represents \~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105

b) the uranium spotprice is only for supply adjustments, while the main part of the uranium supply goes through LT contracts. So when an uranium consumer needs 50k lb uranium through a spot purchase in addition to the 450k lbs they got through an existing LT contract to be able to start the nuclear fuel rods fabrication, than they will just buy those 50k lb at any price, because blocking the start of the nuclear fuel rods fabrication is not an option.

c) buying uranium (example: 50k lb) at 150 USD/lb through the spotmarket, doesn't mean they need to buy 100% of their uranium needs at 150 USD/lb (example: 100% is 500k lb)

Those are the 3 main reasons why **uranium demand is price INelastic**

Utilities don't care if they have to buy uranium at 80 or 150 USD/lb, as long as they get enough uranium and ON TIME

B. On Friday August 23th, 2024, Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond

**Problem is that:**

a) Kazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge.

b) The production of 2025-2028 was already fully allocated to clients! Meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or Kazatomprom & JV partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket. But from whom exactly?

All the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce (They are all short uranium). Cause: Many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing LT contracts that had that option integrated in the contract, forcing producers to supply more uranium. But those uranium producers aren't able increase their production that way.

c) The biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is Uranium One. And 100% of uranium of Uranium One comes from? ... well from Kazakhstan!

Important to keep in mind here is that uranium demand is price INelastic!

Conclusion:

**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce (Because they are forced to by their clients through existing LT contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients)**. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.

And before that announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust is trading at a discount to NAV at the moment. Imo, not for long anymore.

A share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at \~24.25 CAD/share or \~18.00 USD/sh gives you a discount to NAV of 8.75%

An uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \~40.00 CAD/sh or \~29.75 USD/sh.

And with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector

We are at the end of the annual low season in the uranium sector. Next week we will gradually entre the high season again

In the low season in the uranium sector the activity in the uranium spotmarket is reduced to a minimum which reduces the upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket and the uranium spotprice goes back to the LT uranium price.

In the high season with an uranium sector being a sellers market (a market where the sellers have the negotiation power) the activity in the uranium spotmarket increases significantly which significantly increases the upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket. Added to that now the announced additional big uranium production cuts.

The uranium spotprice today:

post,1jfogh2,Dividends are Forced Sales,Aggravating_Plantain,"Reddit wouldn't let me make a formatted comment in a comment thread on another post so I figured I'd just make a post and link to it in that other thread.

When a company pays a dividend, there is an extra, artificial price move in the dividend paying stock because of the payment of the dividend.  If you assume two stocks that have the same market moves and you assume reinvestment for the div. paying stock, the two stocks turn out exactly the same, except the person who received and reinvested the dividend is worse off because they pay some taxes (either ST or LT gains) on the distribution.

Let's do some math.  Option 1 will be the stock that pays a dividend, option two will be the stock that doesn't.  The only difference is that the dividend paying stock has an extra price decline exactly equal to the price of the dividend.  You can google it and it is well established that the effect of a, e.g., 1% share price dividend is equal to a 1% decrease in share price on or around the ex dividend date.  Here's [a Fidelity article explaining it in more detail](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/stocks/why-dividends-matter).  In the real world, it can be hard to see this clearly because stock prices move all day for various reasons.  Perhaps the stock is down 2% on ex div. day because the company had bad news that contributed an additional 1% drop.  Perhaps it's up 5% because the company had good news that contributed a *6% rise*, but the dividend brings the closing price down to 5%.  In the examples below, we'll assume prices only change once per day or w/e--that part's not important.  The important part is that each stock experiences the same exact market forces, and at the end, except for the taxes paid by the dividend investor, the two situations are equal.

# Dividend Paying - Person A

* **1 share of stock is worth $120**, pays a dividend of $30, a **25% dividend** (to make the math easier).
* Person has **1 share at $90** *and $30 cash*.
   * The price of the stock has gone down to **$90/share**, not because of market forces, but because that's how dividend distributions are priced in.
* Person reinvests and now has **1.33333 shares worth $120**
   * (not really,  but lets ignore the taxes for now).
* The stock goes down because of market forces.   Perhaps the CEO of the company becomes a senior member of the government and people don't like what he's doing, so they tank his stock.
   * It goes down **33.3333%** (1/3--assume repeating decimals are infinite) % **to $60 per share**, so the person has **1.33333 shares worth $80**
* The **stock doubles**, going back up to **$120/share**.  The person has **1.33333 shares worth $160.**
   * But again, not really, because the person will pay taxes on the $30 dividend.

# Non-Dividend Paying - Person B

* **1 share** of stock is worth **$120**.
   * The price of the stock doesn't go down by 25% because there wasn't a 25% dividend paid.
* The CEO joins the government again, and the **stock goes down by 1/3** and the person has **1 share worth $80**.
* The **stock doubles**, and is now worth $160.  The person has **1 share worth $160**.
   * The person never paid taxes because there was no dividend.

# Conclusion

* Person A ends up with **1.33 shares worth $160**
   * Person A also has $20 of taxable gains (of some kind--unclear if short or long term).
* Person B ends up with **1 share worth $160**.
* Both persons would be better off if they decided exactly when and exactly how much stock to sell instead of having the company doing it for them and calling the forced sale a dividend.

I get what you're saying, and overall I agree with you. Just trying to help you articulate better.

If the goal is bigger bags, dividends are not free money.

If the goal is having somewhat steady income, and paying the taxes is not an issue, and like participating in some long term capital growth, nothing wrong with dividend portfolio.

Investments are just tools, there is no one size fits all. That being said, most people like sportscar investments, dividend portfolio is more like a tractor.

post,1ecd0m6,The case against dividends,theouilet,"I’ve heard the argument that stocks or ETFs that give dividends are good to have in retirement accounts, especially Roth IRA, due to the tax benefits. However, it seems that their returns are usually lower. 

Wouldn’t I rather invest in ETFs with higher returns and liquidate as needed, rather than invest in ETFs that give dividends but have lower overall returns? 

Plus, if doing this in pre-tax accounts, investing in the former allows me to pay LT capital gain tax rather than income tax.

It seems the benefits of dividends are often overstated. What are your thoughts?",2024-07-26 02:27:45,7.0,36.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ecd0m6/the_case_against_dividends/,investing

comment,1ecd0m6,,,,,,,lf270gr,Here4Snow,"""It's only when you take money out of a trad account that it's taxed.""

Yes; that is why it is called a Distribution.

A Traditional IRA, 401(k), SIMPLE IRA, SEP IRA, etc that is not a Roth Type, means it is comprised of pre-taxed contributions and earnings. Distributions are taxed as ordinary income, unless you also have some basis in that account (post-tax funds). Roth is the senator that provided the bill that introduced post-tax account types for retirement, and these have tax free distributions.

Here is what the OP stated: ""Plus, if doing this in pre-tax accounts, investing in the former allows me to pay LT capital gain tax rather than income tax.""

And that is not correct.

Inside of a pretax account, there is no capital gain recognition. When it is distributed from a pretax retirement account (taken from the account), it is taxed as ordinary income, whether the account has loss or gain, and whether the growth is from stock prices, dividend cash or reinvestment, interest inflow, stock splits, xdividend dates, all of this doesn't matter. The earnings characteristic has no differentiated tax treatment.",2024-07-26 17:04:03,5.0,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ecd0m6/the_case_against_dividends/,investing

I don’t think there’s going to be a middle ground here. In 20 years this tech will probably fail for one reason or another, or 1-2 stocks are going to 100x while the other 8 or however many go to $0 or get bought out.

I'm new to trading and had a question on the strategy of trading. The buy and hold method seems to work and I understand that it works LT and if you had lot of capital then even better. The context is what if you only have USD 10K?

If you were to buy and hold the 10k you're portfolio would basically follow the stock price. Pretty straightforward.

But what if you sell when it drops a certain level and buy when it increases a certain level. Say -5% & +10% rule. Here's the catch, you don't sell and buy the whole portfolio you sell just the part that you gained and ""reinvest"".

post,1gzwqk2,Selling mutual fund before or after capital gain distribution,Responsible-Bid5015,"I have a fund that I would like to sell. All of it would be long term capital gains when sold. It is due to pay out its capital gains distribution in December. The distribution will probably be around $3 a share out of \~$45 a share. Of course I don't know how much of it will be ST vs LT CG.

So after the record date, does the share price drop by $3? And therefore selling afterwards may be worse because of the possible ST capital gain?

post,1fsbt9o,Eyeing Simply Good Foods (SMPL) for a LT Investment,conquistudor,"I'm considering an investment in Simply Good Foods (SMPL) as part of a 20-year strategy in the consumer goods space. Why? Because I believe consumer goods companies that align with health trends can grow even in downturns. I’m aiming for a long-term hold, looking for strong growth, stable value, and low debt.

**Why Simply Good Foods?** The company owns three key brands: Atkins, Quest, and OWYN. While Atkins and OWYN have their challenges, Quest is a leader in the protein bar market. If a store sells protein bars, they probably stock Quest. It's a solid brand with mass distribution and great market share among fitness and health-conscious consumers.

**Recent Financial Performance**: The company has been growing steadily. Fiscal 2023 saw $955.6 million in net sales, driven mainly by Quest, with 14.2% growth in sales. Plus, they operate an asset-light model, which means they outsource manufacturing – keeping costs low and free cash flow high. Cash reserves increased to $208.7 million, and debt was reduced to $237.7 million – signs of solid financial health.

**Growth Catalysts**:

* Acquisition of OWYN: Simply Good Foods bought OWYN, a plant-based protein brand, for $280 million. This taps into the rising trend of plant-based diets and brings a whole new consumer base.
* E-commerce Opportunities: They’re expanding their e-commerce channels – currently, 21% of Quest and 14% of Atkins sales are online – so there's definitely room for growth here.

**Competition & Risks**: Simply Good Foods does face competition in both bars and drinks. But Quest’s distribution advantage gives it a strong moat, and with Atkins and OWYN being rebranded, there’s potential for growth. Still, they’ll need to walk a fine line to keep market share against competitors like FitCrunch, Pure Protein, and bigger players like Fairlife (Coke).

**Final Thoughts**: SMPL feels like an interesting long-term play, aligning with health and nutrition trends while being reasonably valued and not over-leveraged. But it’s not without challenges – especially in marketing, e-commerce, and competition in the drink and bar markets.

If you’re invested or have thoughts on Simply Good Foods, I'd love to hear! And if you've tried any of their products – Atkins, Quest, or OWYN – let me know what you think. Consumer feedback is key in understanding how strong a brand really is.",2024-09-29 18:57:53,21.0,23.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fsbt9o/eyeing_simply_good_foods_smpl_for_a_lt_investment/,stocks

post,1kllo5f,"1 Year Later: Revisiting ""How much are you willing to pay for perfection?""",thelastsubject123,"A year ago, I made a post called ""How much are you willing to pay for perfection? $FICO Analysis

[How much are you willing to pay for perfection? $FICO Analysis : r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dgvrzy/how_much_are_you_willing_to_pay_for_perfection/)

Since that post, $FICO has returned 60%, outperforming the SP500 (12%) by 48 pp.

My investment thesis has more or less stayed the same, both in the pros and the cons. We are halfway through the year so I'll have to use TTM data.

**What's changed in the past year:**

As I expected, FICO's revenue growth, net income growth, and margin expansion story has been intact.

TTM Revenue jumped 15% to $1.84B, TTM Net Income grew 20% to $0.57B, and EPS jumped 21.8% to $23.60.

For FY25, Management expects $1.98B Top line, GAAP Net Income to be $0.625B, with GAAP EPS to be $25.05.

**Balance Sheet:**

LT debt has expanded from $2.2B to $2.5B. Shares outstanding have declined 1.5% to 24.9 Million. Management has also announced a $1.5B senior note offering to retire older higher rate debt. I still do not enjoy the amount of leverage on the balance sheet but I'm not in charge of it. Their cash is mostly going towards share buybacks (1.1B repurchased in TTM) which is not that accretive given the multiple.

**PE:**

[Imgur: The magic of the Internet](https://imgur.com/a/a7fV5Pu)

Incredibly enough, FICO has expanded from a 73 PE from my previous post to a 92 PE. To say this is rich is an understatement. The market is clearly pricing in massive margin expansion as well as safety due to no tarriff risk and minimal business failure due to their monopolistic power.

**Closing Remarks:**

I still believe FICO is the closest thing we have to a perfect business. People may believe VantageScore to be a possible disruptor but ultimately, if everyone is using something because they trust their metrics, why risk potentially losing hundreds of thousands of dollars from poor underwriting to save a few thousand bucks? FICO is still an amazing business, but the multiple leaves little to desire. I have not sold any of my position, nor have I added more given the very rich valuation.",2025-05-13 13:16:13,19.0,13.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kllo5f/1_year_later_revisiting_how_much_are_you_willing/,stocks

post,1ffxkmp,Altimmune or Viking? The Obesity hype. $VKTX vs $ALT,Bossie81,"The Obesity Hype. A real hype that can blow portfolios more so than AI, look at the Viking stock trajectory. To figure out the science, is hard.

I am not saying buy this stock. I am saying, verify the below comparison with somebody. If the below is correct. You did your DD.

1. **Why $ALT over $VKTX?**
   * VKTX-2735 < PEMVI 2.4mg -- PEMVI superior quality of Weight Loss as measured by % FAT vs. % LEAN reduction (i.e. the KEY next-gen GLP1 metric)
   * PEMVI broad CARDIOVASCULAR activity/potential
   * PEMVI MOA includes Thermogenic/RMR component for LT use
   * PEMVI body recomp. potential via class-leading lean muscle preservation
   * PEMVI P3 titration/DR design to 'fix' outlier 48wk P2 (other PEMVI studies have shown tolerability on par with VK2735)
   * VK2735 is faster WL which is better for BMI 40+ class 3 Obesity (smaller market), but not for avg. person -- VK to compete with $LLY Zep,
   * PEMVI is SIGNIFICANTLY differentiated high quality Next-gen GLP1 WL
   * VKTX-2809 < PEMVI 1.8mg -- PEMVI rapid liver defatting in 6-12 wks (MASLD)
   * PEMVI better 24wk anti-fibrotic potential vs 52wk VKTX
   * PEMVI bypasses thyroid and is leading GLP1 liver MOA
2. **Why is Viking valued at 50$ and Altimmune at 6$?**
   * Viking Management simply is better at managing their stock. Viking has 900 million in cash, which they simply raised in a brilliant way.
   * Altimmune had some set-backs in the past, which may make WS suspicious.
   * Altimmune had a short report to endure, in which Kerrisdale stupidly rehashed old data, BUT Altimmune management FAILED at protecting the stock they let Jefferies do their bidding, plus their cash runway is not convincing. Their only response was a meaningless Tweet.
   * Altimmune cash runway 150 million (or so), they stupidly ran the ATM at the absolute wrong moment.
   * Altimmune is stupidly promising a partner for over a year now, and have not delivered.
3. **But why is Altimmune still the better stock?**
   * Pemvi as explained above, is smarter. Not Obesity, but curative fatty liver - COVERED BY INSURANCE ALREADY. Which pure obesity drugs are not, like Zepbound Wegovy
   * Altimmune has FAST TRACK status. A nugget overseen by many
   * Altimmune has a much much larger upside, at this moment. The odds of Viking crashing, extremely high. They are a Bio, they will face a setback. I believe if Viking was to be bought now, it would be at 100$ per share
   * If Altimmune was to be bought now, 40$-75$ per share would be fair.
   * If Altimmune announces a partner, it will likely be a 20$ 30$ stock within days.",2024-09-13 15:29:25,15.0,20.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ffxkmp/altimmune_or_viking_the_obesity_hype_vktx_vs_alt/,stocks

   * PEMVI P3 titration/DR design to 'fix' outlier 48wk P2 (other PEMVI studies have shown tolerability on par with VK2735)
   * VK2735 is faster WL which is better for BMI 40+ class 3 Obesity (smaller market), but not for avg. person -- VK to compete with $LLY Zep,
   * PEMVI is SIGNIFICANTLY differentiated high quality Next-gen GLP1 WL
   * VKTX-2809 < PEMVI 1.8mg -- PEMVI rapid liver defatting in 6-12 wks (MASLD)
   * PEMVI better 24wk anti-fibrotic potential vs 52wk VKTX
   * PEMVI bypasses thyroid and is leading GLP1 liver MOA
2. **Why is Viking valued at 50$ and Altimmune at 6$?**
   * Viking Management simply is better at managing their stock. Viking has 900 million in cash, which they simply raised in a brilliant way.
   * Altimmune had a short report to endure, in which Kerrisdale stupidly rehashed old data, BUT Altimmune management FAILED at protecting the stock they let Jefferies do their bidding.
   * Altimmune cash runway 150 million (or so), they stupidly ran the ATM at the absolute wrong moment.
3. **But why is Altimmune still the better stock?**
   * Pemvi as explained above, is smarter. Not Obesity, but curative fatty liver - COVERED BY INSURANCE ALREADY. Which pure obesity drugs are not, like Zepbound Wegovy
   * Altimmune has FAST TRACK status. A nugget overseen by many
   * Altimmune has a much much larger upside, at this moment. The odds of Viking crashing, extremely high. They are a Bio, they will face a setback. I believe if Viking was to be bought now, it would be at 100$ per share
   * If Altimmune was to be bought now, 40$-75$ per share would be fair.
   * If Altimmune announces a partner, it will likely be a 20$ 30$ stock within days.",2024-10-21 08:50:08,5.0,6.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g8l2w0/alt_obesity_hype_is_not_over_upside_enormous/,stocks

And you’re embarrassing yourself with point #2. Share price being higher = more expensive stock? 🤡

Based on the way you presented this, you missed some of the most important things I’d personally be looking for as a biotech investor. I don’t know if you’re just trying to pump your bags, if you even understand the science, or if you even understand the timing of making this investment in the current landscape but… The drug with the highest % weight loss does not automatically become the winner is all I’ll say.",2024-10-21 15:27:26,4.0,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g8l2w0/alt_obesity_hype_is_not_over_upside_enormous/,stocks
