Tensions with India must be viewed in context. India is backing terrorism in Pakistan and hiding behind false narratives. 

Within minutes of the Pahalgam incident, Indian media blamed Pakistan without evidence. 

Later, India’s own spokesperson admitted investigations were ongoing.

Pakistan offered cooperation via a neutral body if India had proof, but India rejected this and attacked Pakistani mosques, killing civilians. 

India supports terrorism in Pakistan, from TTP to Baloch groups.

Pakistan Armed Forces are bound to protect sovereignty—and did so, fully and decisively.

On May 9–10, India launched more attacks. On May 10, Pakistan responded with precision, targeting only military sites, avoiding civilians—a balanced and responsible reply.
