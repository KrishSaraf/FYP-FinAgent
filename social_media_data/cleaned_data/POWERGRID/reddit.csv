post,1da2dnd,My little research on Powergrid stock. Whats your opinion on this.,Due_Training6535,"   Power Grid Corporation of India (POWERGRID) is a dominant player in the Indian power transmission sector. Here's a summary of its strengths to help you decide on investing:
 * Strong financial performance: Powergrid has a healthy track record of profitability and dividend payouts.
 * Monopoly position: The company enjoys a near-monopoly position in the interstate power transmission segment in India.
 * Government backing:  Being a government-owned company, Powergrid benefits from a certain degree of stability.
However, there are also some factors to consider:
 * Limited growth potential: The company's growth might be limited due to its already established network.
 * Regulatory environment: The power sector is subject to government regulations, which can impact profitability.
Overall, Powergrid is a relatively low-risk investment option with a steady dividend yield. However, its growth potential might be limited. Consider your investment goals and risk tolerance before making a decision.  Financially, POWERGRID maintains solid fundamentals. For 2024, the company reported net income of ₹155 billion and sales of ₹458 billion, with projections for 2025 indicating growth to ₹160 billion in net income and ₹472 billion in sales. The company also offers a dividend yield of around 3.8% to 3.88%, making it attractive for income-focused investors

comment,1dd622e,,,,,,,l82pndy,kross69,"1. Yes, provided you buy before the cutoff date
2. Look for high dividend yield stocks on Screener. 

But buying a share just for dividends doesn't make sense. The stock should be good as well. Also, define what good dividend means to you. A Rs 3 dividend for each Tata Motor share might be good for a person holding 100 shares. While Rs 30 dividend by Hawkins for each share might be sub par for a person holding 5 shares.",2024-06-11 05:16:43,40.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1dd622e/what_are_the_best_shares_to_buy_to_earn_good/,IndianStockMarket

post,1k96xm6,📢 Altius Telecom Infra Trust 📡 | High Yield ~11.7% | INVIT,Electronic_Usual7945,"📌 **About Altius Telecom Infra Trust**:

* Originally set up in **2019** as **Data Infrastructure Trust**.
* **Ownership Update**:
   * **Earlier Sponsor**: Reliance Industrial Investments (part of Reliance group).
   * **Now Owned/Sponsored By**: **Brookfield Group** (BIF IV Jarvis India Pte Ltd and Project Holdings Nine DIFC Ltd) since late 2024.
* **Trustee**: Axis Trustee Services Limited.
* **Investment Manager**: Data Link Investment Manager Pvt Ltd (Brookfield group company).
* **Focus**: Owns and operates **telecom tower infrastructure** for telecom operators like Reliance Jio.

💼 **Business Model**:

* Passive infra leasing (towers, rooftop sites, small cells, IBS).
* Long-term lease contracts, mainly Reliance Jio as anchor tenant.
* Extremely stable cash flows backed by mission-critical infra.

📈 **Financial Snapshot (FY24**):

* **Revenue**: ₹12,877 crore
* **EBITDA**: ₹4,841 crore
* **EBITDA Margin**: 38%
* **Distribution Yield**: **11.7%**
* **Return on Equity (since inception)**: 23.2%

💸 **Dividend History (Summed Year-wise)**:

|Year|Total Dividend (₹)|
|:-|:-|
||
|2022|₹7.90|
|2023|₹13.41|
|2024|₹19.31|
|2025|\*(till March)\*₹3.29|

**YoY Growth:**

* 2022 → 2023: **+69.75%**
* 2023 → 2024: **+44.00%**

(2025 is still ongoing.)

🔥 **Why it’s Interesting**:

* **Stable, high yield (\~11-12%)** — better than REITs and FDs.
* **Brookfield-backed** — strong global infra player.
* **Anchor tenant Jio** ensures steady occupancy and cash flows.
* Huge role in India's 4G/5G network expansion.

⚡ **Key Risks**:

* Tenant concentration: Majority revenue from Jio.
* Regulatory shifts in SEBI InvIT norms.
* Rising interest rates could impact valuation slightly.

**Altius InvIT** (ex-Data InvIT) offers a rare mix: **high yield, strong cash flow, and Brookfield muscle**. If you want passive income linked to India's digital growth, worth a look! 📡🚀

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

After a prolonged bull run, NTPC is now exhibiting signs of weakness and potential reversal. The stock has broken its support level and closed below it, signaling a bearish sentiment. The Rohit Momentum Indicator (RMI) is in sell mode across all timeframes, including the weekly timeframe.

Additionally, the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) shows a rapid deterioration in NTPC's relative strength. If the weakness persists, the stock could shift from the weakening quadrant to the lagging quadrant, potentially leading to significant underperformance.

post,1fjn5yt,Results of  Nifty 100 Earnings-Based Strategy,Fit_Soft_3669,"Over the past few months, I have been working on multiple strategies. While backtesting, most strategies have shown returns of around 18% to 20%. However, I've recently been focused on a strategy based on the earnings dates of Nifty 100 companies, using a risk-reward ratio of 1:2.

The results so far look very promising and suggest that the strategy can be further optimized to increase returns. The numbers seem almost too good to be true. Below are some of the results.

post,1dy9hy1,PFC | More short covering possible?,jacked_to-the_tits,"We all know that **PFC (Power Finance Corporation),** is in the spotlight with the upcoming budget session due to focus on energy & power sector. Also since ***Bernstein*** has already ***pointed out*** why this stock is a ***good pick fundamentally***, I will simply reiterate those points: (i) trading a low price-to-earnings ratio of 9x as compared to industry average of 31x, and (ii) India is likely to add 300GW of power generation capacity in the next six years (whereas India added 100GW of power generation capacity in the last six years) so PFC's business is also likely to grow.   
  
Bernstein's ***price target is 650*****,** but the ***current market price is only at 550*** levels! 

Now comes the most interesting part - option data shows over 60 lakh+ call options have been sold at strikes 550 and 560! On the other hand futures open interest data shows that around 5 crore future contracts were sold between 25-28 June, when PFC was trading below 500 levels and out of which only around 50-70 lakh contracts have been squared off. That's a sea of shorts who will be forced to cover their positions by buying the stock if the price moves upwards towards Bernstein's target of 650!

Lets also look at the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/v13gej5tuabd1.jpg?width=2541&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f77d6d71ed6fe06bd3f1b07f754b72322d632022

It looks like PFC has broken the middle of this rising channel, tested the middle as the support, and has rise again. Also we can see that every time this channel's middle is broken in the upwards direction, the top of the channel has been tested. The only immediate resistance that I can see is at 560, but once that is broken, there seems to be no resistance up until Bernstein's target of 650. So it seems plausible that more short covering is about to happen isn't it?

If I made a lumpsum investment in NIFTY 50 mutual fund on 1994 then I have received ""fractions of each shares "" present in Nifty 50 at 1994.

Now when i sell the same in 2024, 75% of the 1994 stocks have already lost the shine. So i would be getting good profit from ""fractions of stocks"" like Unilever/SBI/Reliance who have survived this 20 year ride.  , so ultimately i would be receiving very less profit when i redeem in 2024 as valuations of All other stocks has reduced too much

comment,1ev8fhk,,,,,,,lipusqs,parabola9999,"I assumed, sorry if it ticked you off the wrong way. The statement was meant in jest, clearly our senses of humor differ considerably. 

1. Again, not a Covid investor myself, but the assumption that risks are necessary for market-beating rewards is not a sane theory. You can, and should, aim to beat the markets at your ideal risk appetite, and then compare the risk-reward against your beta when benchmarking. This is, in essence, the efficient market hypothesis.

2. Red and green hota rehta hai. Good that you're enjoying tropical paradise abhi, and congrats on the same. But Bees is just a basket of stocks, and nothing more than that. It's not inherently bad, it's like trading on an index-linked ETF when you don't have a clear picture about the constituents, but like the theme. Sure, individual components within a basket of stocks will definitely overperform the average, but it also protects you from underperformance.

post,1emt0ex,Future stock predictions,ItsBananaz,"Hi all,

I want to know your opinions on any stocks that you can see huge gains on in the future (40-50+ years). Examples would include APPL at IPO, NVDA 5 years ago, or AMZN. 

What I’m currently thinking is anything nuclear, utilities (mainly electricity/powergrid), cyber security, and space exploration/tourism. I saw the run up in ASTS and figured it was a good time to start dipping my hands into some companies that have solid outlooks. I have also made significant gains on NVDA during the bull run, and subsequent bear run (Jan 17th $8 Calls on NVDQ), and looking to buy the dip in any tech stocks. 

I’m also 19 so I have time on my side when it comes to these picks.",2024-08-08 01:11:59,0.0,8.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1emt0ex/future_stock_predictions/,stocks
comment,1emt0ex,,,,,,,lh1d5pn,DamnImBeautiful,"Based on your background, as a 19 year old with no relevant and specialized industry knowledge. I’d say any investment into individual stocks is a gamble. Just toss your money into sp500 like most blokes that are lazy or want a high guarantee of a strong return 

Individual stock investments are worth it if and only if you have some sort of experience in said industry as it allows you to know the general sentiment of specific corporations competing in the same industry",2024-08-08 01:22:48,8.0,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1emt0ex/future_stock_predictions/,stocks

Not the exciting advice you probably wanted, but keep in mind that some of the stocks you listed might be worth even less than they are now in 50 years

Growth of the overall market is pretty much guaranteed at that timescale… But many stocks will individually drop … For example in 2000 intel hit over $70 a share and was a leader in their industry, could have easily seen them on this list of strong stocks then.. 

Experts can’t even predict what will happen in the next minute of the stock market, and it will be nearly impossible to project 40-50 years, but I can tell you for near certainly that the S&P 500 will be a lot higher then",2024-08-08 02:13:10,4.0,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1emt0ex/future_stock_predictions/,stocks

You didn't think very far then.

Nuke is kneecapped by absurd regulations. Takes like 1-2 decades for a plant to come on-line. Few companies really have the desire and capital to build them. SMRs need to be the play but progress on developing them has stalled. 

Utilities (my industry) is not a growth stock. It's a dividend stock that you keep in your portfolio to hedge against volatility and downturns. You also have to understand how utilities make money as they are a regulated industry. 

Cyber security is the only good play you listed, but you really need to understand the technology and the current trends. Cyber spend also tends to the first thing to go out the window during hard financial times - which is chuckleheaded but whatever. 

Space exploration...lol, no. Might as well just wait 30 years and put all your money on black.",2024-08-08 04:03:39,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1emt0ex/future_stock_predictions/,stocks
