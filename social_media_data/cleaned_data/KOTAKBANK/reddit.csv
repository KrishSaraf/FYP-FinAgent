post,1kf4729,Kotak Mahindra Bank Q4 FY25 Results In – And the Shares fall 5% in a single day💀                   Let's take a look at its concalls,Internal_Site7818,"Consolidated PAT up 21% YoY to ₹22,126 Cr — excluding KGI divestment gains, growth stood at 5%.  
  
 Shift in Strategy: Moving from product-centric to customer-centric approach. Kotak is now bundling products for defined customer segments like affluent (Solitaire) & mass (811 app relaunch).  
  
 Unsecured Loan Book Dips to 10.5% of total advances (from 11.8% in FY24) due to tech embargo & higher delinquencies.  
  
 Strong Asset Growth: Advances up 18% YoY, deposits up 16% YoY. CASA ratio stable at 43%. CD ratio at 85.5%.  
  
 Credit Discipline: Credit costs rose to 60 bps (vs 40 bps last year). Microfinance strain continues, but delinquencies in personal loans and credit cards are plateauing.

Capital Market Boom: Asset Management PAT up 75% YoY, Capital Markets up 40% YoY. Kotak AMC AUM now at ₹6.69 L Cr.  
  
 Credit Cards Rebooted: Post-embargo, a fresh GTM strategy launched. New premium card (Solitaire) for affluent customers.  
  
 Deposit Costs Cut: SA rates reduced to 2.75%-3.25%. Sweep TD and regular TDs repriced to improve NIMs. Cost of funds managed at 5.10%.  
  
 Fortress Balance Sheet: CET1 at 22.3%, overall CAR at 23.3%. High capital buffer to weather risk & seize M&A opportunities.  
  
 FY26 Outlook: Strong start. Brand revamp, digital growth, and cautious optimism amid global headwinds. Targeting 1.5x–2x GDP growth in advances.

so sectors move in cycles , and banking sectors has been a laggard , but it should be the best time to invest in banking  for next 1-3 years , the cycle will turn. dumb investors will chase sectors which has performed well recently,  expecting same overperformance , but they will end buying the top and wont get any return

34YO Male. Professional Income. 

Started post-Covid. But a substantial sum out of this has been invested in the last 3-4 months.

Point is to review the portfolio / allocation etc. as it stands today - for the future. That is why I have provided current value of holdings (though invested sum can be calculated pretty easily). Past gains (especially %ages) are indicative of pretty much nothing as I have been irregular in buying and accumulating over the said period.

Would love everyone's views and opinions. 

PS - discerning folks on here will be able to see Saurabh Mukherjea's influence but even more discerning (and sympathethic) folks will be able to see I am reducing the said influence now 😄

LATE (AND LONG) EDIT - As rightly said in some replies, MF portfolio has some unnecessary over-complication. I'm slowly moving my inv from Axis ELSS to PP ELSS (as and when 3 year limit ends), so count one less fund. The two PP funds again I count as basically one big Flexi fund, so that's again one less fund. Small caps I don't feel comfortable with just one fund, and the universe is large enough to accommodate two funds. 
So basically-
•one Largecap (Niftybees) 
•one Flexicap (2 PPs + whatever's left of Axis)
•one Large & Mid
•one Midcap
•two Smallcaps
•one USA (where in fact if someone can suggest which should I actually invest in, anyway PP Flexi can't invest more in the US stocks).

post,1jmgw56,Large-Cap Stocks (Nifty50): Technical Insights as We Wrap Up FY 2024-25,priteshpalan,"As we approach the end of the financial year, I took a look at the charts of some large-cap stocks (Nifty50). Sharing my observations below—not as calls to buy or sell, but as insights based on price action. Even after 20+ years of studying charts, I still consider myself a learner, and I believe the market always has something new to teach.

# Stock Observations:

🔹 **TATAMOTORS** – Weak unless it crosses & closes above **725**. Sell on rise otherwise.

🔹 **TCS** – Broken previous weekly low; break below 3457 with volume it could fall to **2744**.

🔹 **KOTAKBANK** – Broke out above **1980-2000**; any dip and re-test to this level may offer a **long-term buying opportunity**.

**On daily chart**

* The price was like in most stock of the nifty 50 has fallen off of the uptrend and is now in downtrend.
* The resistance at \~1797 levels was tested before and the price failed to close above.
* However the price bounced back from the dynamic support levels at \~1746 which could be potential be a new Higher High of an uptrend signalling a trend reversal.
* The last candlestick formed was a Shooting Star which indicates the price being rejected by the buyers and sellers taking over.
* We might see a correction downwards of the price over the next few days.

**On 15min chart**

* We can see a Divergence of the RSI and the price which indicated a Bearish Divergence, signalling a trend reversal.
* The last candle was a Inverted Hammer and the price closed below the opening price. We could see a correction of the price to the DS 1 levels.
* If the price close below the DS1 and DS2 levels, we can confirm the trend has reversed.

post,1dk36nr,Portfolio and Strategy Review,Low-Musician-163,"Hello everyone, I am a university student and have been investing in the market since last 3 years. I have attached my portfolio below. I usually wait for my stocks to hit a certain price before I take out the principal amount and the profit remains invested in the stock itself. I try to choose stocks with good fundamentals and have not consistently invested in a stock because I may not have the patience for it right now and also my capital is limited. I know no. of stocks are greater compared to the capital invested but some of my bets take more time to give returns and some are impulse decisions that I intend to cut down.
