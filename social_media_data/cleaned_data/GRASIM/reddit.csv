comment,1hawp77,,,,,,,m1bxphh,SuperbPercentage8050,"I have given a framework and checklist on r/indiagrowthstocks and be it mid cap or small cap or large cap if any stocks goes through that filter you will end up with high quality stocks and investment. 

The LARGE CAP WONT GO A 100 BAGGER BECAUSE OF SIZE AT A MATURE OR LATE STAGE YOU GET A DECENT 12-15% IF YOU HOLD IT FOR LONG TIME AND THE SECTOR ITSELF HAS A RUNWAY. 

With small and madcap if they operate in sectors that have growth for long periods and they dominate in that sector then you get multi baggers. because the pe expands from 215-20 to 80 and eps grows at same pace. 

for example polycab was a 8-10x because of the secular runway of fiberisation of whole India and pe was 20 so a reasonable valuation. pe expanded a3 times and eps also expanded 3-4 times  so we had a 10x return. 

  
asian paints use to trade at 20-25 pe and same goes for polycab and havells and so may other stocks before then run up. now trading in 2023 at 80-90 pe and growing at 10-15% is not justified that's why they are underperforming because pe will revert back to mean. same happened with Bajaj it was a 80 pe stock and eps went 2.5 times but pe compressed to 27 that's why stock didn't move. 



Growth and long runway is essential for a stock to compound and one needs to invest it at reasonable valuations, today most of mid and small are trading at 70-80 pe so even with all the growth the valuations and price we pay for that growth is not justified.",2024-12-10 08:19:34,11.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hawp77/buy_and_forget_strategy_for_bluechip_stocks/,IndianStockMarket

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1gte06v,Where are NIFTY50 stocks headed? What can be the next course of action?,Ok_Set_6991,"With the Q2 results season being dull and FIIs selling off daily, the DIIs and the government would prefer to prevent the NIFTY50 index from falling much so that retail investors do not lose hope and stop the SIPs.

That being said, more interesting developments are going on such as Zomato and JioFin being poised to replace BPCL and Eicher Motors in the NIFTY50 index during its rebalancing in March 24.

This obviously means more funds will go into Zomato and JioFin as a part of NIFTY50 SIPs. Will this be the perfect time to start buying Zomato and JioFin shares?

Also, Asian Paints is facing hard times due to the competition from Grasim and a similar story for many NIFTY50 companies that have reported a decline in revenue/profits. Which companies from NIFTY50 (top 5, top 10, etc) are considered best to invest in right now considering the recent and previous quarters' earnings, growth potential, and other similar factors?

post,1hk0ovs,Concord Enviro Systems IPO,Aditya_Kabu,"**Was curious why the GMP is just 5%? Is it because of their recent financial report?** 

Leading provider of global water and wastewater treatment, reuse, and zero-liquid discharge (ZLD) solutions.  
  
The company specializes in offering comprehensive, in-house services across the entire value chain, including design, manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance (O&M), and digitalization through IoT technologies.

* Combination of OFS and fresh equity sale
* Backward integrated manufacturing facilities
* Listing at a PE of 35.1
* In FY24, the company's revenue from operations grew 45% YoY to Rs 497 crore, while the profit after tax (PAT) increased 655% to Rs 41 crore
* ROE 13.7%, ROCE 14%

  
The company offers in-house solutions across the entire value chain, including design, manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance (O&M), and digitalization, such as IoT. The company provides integrated wastewater treatment and zero liquid discharge (ZLD) solutions, focusing on energy optimization and recovery to aid industries in achieving water conservation and sustainability goals.

The company's business can be segregated into the following:-

1. The manufacture and sale of water and wastewater treatment, reuse and ZLD of systems and plants and turnkey solutions;
2. Operations and maintenance;
3. The manufacture and sale of consumables and spare parts (including membranes, plants, chemicals and consumables); and
4. Installation of compressed biogas plants (“CBG Plants”).

As of March 31, 2024, the company exports its solutions to North America, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia and has a large customer base of 377 customers worldwide.

As of FY 2024, the company has served over 353 domestic and 24 international customers in pharmaceuticals, chemicals, food and beverage, defence, automotive, steel, and textiles, with a presence in two countries. 

The company's clients include Diageo Mexico Operaciones, S.A. De C.V., Grasim Industries Limited, AB Mauri, Anthem Biosciences Private Limited, Bhopal Glues and Chemicals Private Limited, Kasyap Sweetners Private Limited, LANXESS India Private Limited, Puja Spintex Private Limited, SFC Environmental Technologies Private Limited, SMS Limited and Tagros Chemicals India Private Limited. Furthermore, the company currently executes projects for multinational companies like Diageo Mexico Operaciones, S.A. De C.V.that include implementing a ZLD solution for their distillery in La Barca, Jalisco, Mexico and a ZLD solution for another customer at their factory in New York, United States of America.

The company has two manufacturing facilities: one in Vasai, India, and another in Sharjah, UAE. Their in-house R&D team, comprising 21 employees as of March 31, 2024, develops the solutions.

**Competitive Strengths**

* Market leadership in ZLD technology in India, well placed to harness global industry opportunities
* Integrated solutions provider supported by backward integrated manufacturing facilities
* Established presence in international markets
* Diversified customer base across multiple industries and geographies

  
**A plausible reason?**

For 5M of FY25 ended on August 31 2024, it earned a ***net profit of Rs. 0.52 cr. on a total income of Rs. 208.02 cr***. According to the management, due to year end investments by its clients, the major portion of its revenue and earnings happens in second half of the fiscal.

For the reported periods, the company has posted PAT margins of 5.00% (FY22), 1.60% (FY23), 8.34% (FY24), ***0.25% (5M-FY25)***, and the RoCE margins of 10.23%, 6.96%, 14.07%, ***2.08%*** for the referred periods respectively. 

Is it better to rather invest in WABAG after their dip last week?

post,1kf6m4v,"Grasim Industries finally breaking out of its pennant pattern, who else is watching this move? (Chart analysis inside) 👇🏻",The_Market_Maven,"Grasim Industries is attempting a breakout from a pennant pattern, typically a bullish continuation setup.

post,1i5qqn4,why xomato is about that bullsh!t as on 20-jan-25,Ig1M,"being in main index, that is made up of our country's biggest giant companies, which is laughable.
it is possible it was done to support the stock price, or bring other people's money in, via passive flows, so existing biggies could dump.
if xomato is in sensex, it is 33rd in rank by mcap today. and it was 1/6th just 2 years ago. for how Long it has been in top 30? if it's a mega giant Largecap,it should behave Like it, not Like a b!tch.

its market cap is higher than real companies Like:
Asian Paints/ Siemens/ Nestle India - Britannia/ DLF - Lodha/ VBL/ Tata Steel/ Divis lab - Cipla - mankind Pharma - Dr Reddy - Lupin/ indigo/ Grasim/ SBI Life - HDFC Life/ Hyundai Motor/ Pidilite/ Hindalco/ Ambuja/ Baroda Bank - PNB - IOB/ Polycab - Havells

xomato isn't better than LTIMINDTREE, Tech Mahindra, Coforge, LTTS, Sonata soft, Birlasoft, Cyient, Zensar, Mphasis, TATA Elxsi, KPIT Tech, Honeywell, Tata Tech, Delhivery, BDL, indigo - they fly aeroplane in the air for gods sake, ABB, Persistent, Bosch, OFSS, GMR Airports, BSE the damn exchange, vodafone idea the entire company, BlueDart, etc. thats nuts. 

infact xomato's mcap is more than entire Polycab & Havells combined together, that did 5,498+4,889= 10,387 crores sales in 3 months, whereas xomato sales 5,405: half of above.
half sales, double mcap?

PE of 351 means its equal to 

buying india's highest PAT earning bank SBI share at 28,143 

or buying india's highest PAT earning company Reliance share at 17,946

or buying 1 MRF share at 16 Lakh 11 Thousand, assholess!

after doing every exploitation under the sun, it is a 3% OPM business, and they rely on other income for profit. can't fund own expansion, needs fundraising and someone keeps buying a 4cr sports car each time.

since jan 2024, more and more retail has entered the stock, taking the price from 133 to 302. preferential shares and QIB shares have been allotted to big companies at better prices.

post,1et8tnw,Hal king of swing trade,Dry-Expert-2017,"Just a advice. 

I am not a trader but I made some good money in HAL future, in past two week..

The stock pe is great and company prospects are strong long term. 

In Future. Just buy one lot , and sell one lot daily. 

The stock has daily movement upto 100 rs. It always crashes from top and rises up from bottom. I don't know the reason but it's happening every day, since I started.

All you have to do is to squeeze 20, 30 rs profitable trades. 

I am an equity investors and hate everything about future and options.

But instead of timing the market, I like bring down my cost of acquisition down. 

And i realised, fno is great tool, to reduce my average cost of acquisition.

In intraday, on hal September future.  if I am wrong and market crashes, I wil be happy to take delivery by September end, and be a bag holder. 

Because for me equity is like land, I wil never sell Untill I need the money.

I always assume everything i buy may crash. 

So this advise is for long-term investors. 

Suppose you want to hold hal 300 shares for long term. 

I would recommend give it a try in fno market. And take delivery if you are wrong.

I bought hal at 4800. I was wrong and it went down to 4500 twice. So don't take stocks advise from me, I am terrible. I am a pure finance freak, but terrible at chart analysis. I neither beleive in it, nor do think it has any indicator just your imagination.

But, after a day I started swing trade on HAL future, with intention to take delivery if I am wrong. 

After all good or bad calls, without any chart reading. 

Cost of hal shares acquisition is now at 3600. 

My goal with swing trades is not make money, just bring my acquisition cost down. 

I know market will crash, and HAL will crash too. 

But all i want is to bring down my acquisition cost. 

So if you like the idea, give it a try. 

Don't trade it for profits. Just focus on bringing the cost of acquisition down.

I would love to do chart reading and technical analysis. But neither i understand it, believe in charts nor do I have the time all day, to pursue it.

My strategy is simple. I take 2 to 4 lots, which I can afford to take delivery if I am completely wrong. I buy around 10:30, i sell above 50 rs, I don't trade intraday for profits or keep stop loss. I repeat the cycle twice in a day, that's all the time I have for stock market. 

This won't work permanently  and  i don't know if I am right. But it is working for me. I thought I should share with you. 

Fno is a curse, I won't advice anyone.. the only reason I trade in September future is because, I need a month's time to arrange Money for delivery. Because I trade with assumption I am wrong. My only concern is my acquisition cost. Bringing it down gives me joy.

I never plan to sell anything, or buy for short term. 

60000 crore was lost Last year in future and options.  So i don't want to encourage that behaviour. This advice is only for people who want to hold HAL for long term. If you are wrong, you have to take delivery after 2 months, if you are right, you bring down your cost everyday. 

I have tried this with Sriram finance, grasim, srf. I had average success. Nothing to be proud of or worth my time. As I am not full time trader. But in HAL it's just magical. 

I have never shorted any share i listed here. I don't bet on nifty or stock  crashing. Not because of morals, but because of simple maths, market and stock goes up every year. So it's easier for me to profit, when it goes up, then to predict everyday when it will go down. 

You can use reverse strategy if you are seller or bear. It works both ways. But i wanna be wrong if HAL goes down, rather then being right about it. 

I am open to learn. If I am wrong.  You won't hurt my feelings, you can speak your mind. If this is stupid advice. 

To trigger you guys more, I don't understand nifty or trade in benchmark index. Because for me company i like, is more important then index. I want hal, sriram finance, srf, grasim to do better. Many others which I can't list. Because they are extremely good buisness imo, i would love them to succeed!
