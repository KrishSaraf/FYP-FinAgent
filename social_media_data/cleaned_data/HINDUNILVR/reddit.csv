post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

Hindustan Unilever has dropped over 24% from its high of 3000 but is now at a strong support level that has held since 2018. The stock is showing signs of reversal, forming a triple bottom pattern with RSI divergence, which indicates a possible bounce from this level. Today, it broke above the resistance of this pattern and is now trading above the 40-day EMA. The RMI indicator is also giving a buy signal on both daily and weekly charts. Based on price action, the stock seems to be gaining strength, but the weekly 40-EMA could act as a resistance on the way up.

post,1fmnmea,Looking for suggestions to trim my portfolio,shankeybalwani,"I've holdings in 46 stocks I've been investing since 2019 and as I've learnt more during the last 5~ odd years, I understand having a long list of companies with little invested amounts doesn't make sense and want to trim the number of companies under 30.

I'm looking to do so by comparing a combination of ratios, but that's still so confusing and time consuming considering each industry has its own benchmark/ historical average.

Is there a free tool/ website that can help in comparison and ease my decision making?

post,1fi2695,Confusion regarding divesting direct equities into a Nifty 50 Index !? ,bharti18,"Need some advice fam !!

Had invested in these 6 stocks in Jan 2021, should I continue to hold them as they have only yielded 8.5% average annually in last 3.5 years, if you see until now, which is much lower than the average return of a nifty 50 index also…which has been about 14% annually in last 3 years..

I am confused if I should sell of these and take a 12.5% LTCG tax  hit which will bring my average return to 7% something and then start from scratch with this 6 Lac about remains capital by starting a Nifty 50 or should I hold them forget about them for the long term of let say 10/15 years, which I can do actually. LTCG is coming around 18,000 INR as of now.

Male 32, Married. **Goal/Reason of investing - Capital accumulation & appreciation for home’s downpayment in the long term.** The only stock portfolio savings I have and the rest almost the same amount is in FDs.

post,1fjn5yt,Results of  Nifty 100 Earnings-Based Strategy,Fit_Soft_3669,"Over the past few months, I have been working on multiple strategies. While backtesting, most strategies have shown returns of around 18% to 20%. However, I've recently been focused on a strategy based on the earnings dates of Nifty 100 companies, using a risk-reward ratio of 1:2.

The results so far look very promising and suggest that the strategy can be further optimized to increase returns. The numbers seem almost too good to be true. Below are some of the results.

post,1djfydv,"Hindustan Unilever Trading Adventures: Ups, Downs, and Lessons",singh_ashish184,"Hey everyone! This is my first post here. I wanted to share my trading experience with Hindustan Unilever. 

https://preview.redd.it/ty4vdzmtai7d1.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=d067fb238ff359558f27d70a4805ca85b8ac5834

Here's a quick rundown:

1. In January, I sold 1 lot of HINDUNILVR 2600 PE for a premium of around 29. It shot up to 174, resulting in a loss of about 43k.
2. Next, I bought February futures at around 2,445 and sold 1 lot of HINDUNILVR 2600 CE at 16. Despite both trades going south, I lost 13k in futures but gained 4.4k from the CE short.
3. I rolled over to April futures, skipping March, buying at 2434. HINDUNILVR continued to drop, leading to a loss of around 52k.
4. However, I didn't give up. I rolled over to June futures (skipping May) and finally hit the jackpot as HINDUNILVR surged, giving me a profit of around 1L.

Despite the ups and downs, I stuck to my strategy and managed to minimize my losses to just around 5k overall. What are your thoughts on this journey? Let me know. I've attached a screenshot for reference, although the trade details might vary slightly.",2024-06-19 10:34:32,2.0,3.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1djfydv/hindustan_unilever_trading_adventures_ups_downs/,IndianStockMarket

Hindustan Unilever has dropped over 24% from its high of 3000 but is now at a strong support level that has held since 2018. The stock is showing signs of reversal, forming a triple bottom pattern with RSI divergence, which indicates a possible bounce from this level. Today, it broke above the resistance of this pattern and is now trading above the 40-day EMA. The RMI indicator is also giving a buy signal on both daily and weekly charts. Based on price action, the stock seems to be gaining strength, but the weekly 40-EMA could act as a resistance on the way up.

Hindustan Unilever has dropped over 24% from its high of 3000 but is now at a strong support level that has held since 2018. The stock is showing signs of reversal, forming a triple bottom pattern with RSI divergence, which indicates a possible bounce from this level. Today, it broke above the resistance of this pattern and is now trading above the 40-day EMA. The RMI indicator is also giving a buy signal on both daily and weekly charts. Based on price action, the stock seems to be gaining strength, but the weekly 40-EMA could act as a resistance on the way up.
