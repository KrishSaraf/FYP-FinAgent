comment,1kyeqxm,,,,,,,mv0o8d4,BoredTigerWillKill,"What's your definition of ""bleeding"". If it's 5% correction in a week then you need to find a better asset class.

Also, if you can't track the companies and major news related to them in your portfolio then you shouldn't be investing in direct stocks.

Holding stocks does not mean keeping your eyes and ears closed.

Having said all this, there's nothing wrong with ITC. This is just due to a block deal by BAT.

Noob opinion but I think the purchase price of ITC determined the price at which we got ITC Hotels. There is a listing price but that's not applicable for ITC shareholders.

No calculation check has been done from my side and opinion stated above is purely speculative.

post,1icqwu7,*** ITC Hotels Valuation -Loss ***,saviofive,"Did the average ITC investor loose money because of this stock split?

ITC Hotels shares listed today at 180 ish falling by a few percentage points shortly after. They were awarded to ITC stock holders for every 10 shares held which means at this valuation they are worth about 17+Rs

The day ITC fell because of the split it was trading close to 490 Rs and fell to around 430 because of the split, a variance of 60 Rs

This would imply the stock (ITCHOTELS) should be worth 600 to make up for that variance.

This still leaves 31 rupee drop due to demerger. 

If an investor bought the ITC solely for hotel stock and sold it immediately after record date, he would need to see a stock trade at 310 just to breakeven.

To receive the ITC dividend, you must purchase shares prior to the ex-dividend date (May 28, 2025). Shares purchased on May 27, 2025 (Tuesday), will settle on May 28, 2025, under the T + 1 settlement cycle. This will put your name on the company record by the record date (which is also May 28, 2025). Consequently, the last date to purchase ITC shares to be eligible for the dividend is May 27, 2025.

post,1idibgy,Have ITC demerger players been fooled?,Pop_Knee,"So ITC has proportioned net book value of 13.51% to ITC Hotels Ltd., the demerged entity. On the record date, ITC was at 490. By that logic, ITC Ltd shares market price post demerger should have been approx 424. And the shares of ITC Hotels Ltd. should've traded at approx 662 post merger.

On the contrary, the ITC hotels shares are hitting lower circuits below 170 also. What is going on? Have I done some mistake in calculating anything?",2025-01-30 08:11:52,67.0,12.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1idibgy/have_itc_demerger_players_been_fooled/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1idibgy,,,,,,,m9z8pw0,SuperbPercentage8050,"It’s first stage of a demerger framework.

The Demerger Framework.

**Major reasons why companies pursue Demerger and how to benefit from them**

* **To unlock hidden value that is otherwise not recognised** by the market when the company is viewed as a conglomerate.**(ITC’s hotel business has been overshadowed by the company’s larger FMCG and paperboard businesses. By demerging the hotel business, ITC will allow the market to re-evaluate the value of this segment independently.This could lead to the hotel business being undervalued at first, because institutional investors who are focused on FMCG or other sectors may sell off the stock.)**
* **The parent company can  better allocate capital to its most profitable segments**, improving its overall capital efficiency and profitability.\*\*(\*\*After the hotel business is demerged, ITC will be able to focus more on its FMCG,Smoke, paperboard, and packaging segments, which are  higher-margin and less capital-intensive compared to the hotel business.**This could allow ITC to allocate capital more efficiently and potentially increase the profitability of its remaining divisions**.)
* By spinning off a business, both the **parent company and the new company can focus on what they do best**.When a business is freed from large corporate parent, entrepreneurial forces are unleashed in the new division .This can lead to better performance and greater growth potential for both businesses.
* To appeal to a more specific group of investors.The parent company may attract investors interested in more mature, stable businesses, while the spinoff may attract those looking for faster growth or higher risk.
* **Tax, antitrust, regulatory Issue(ITC demerger is not not based on this)**

**You don’t need special formulas or mathematical models to make money from spinoff. You just need to exploit the fundamental issues.**

**Two Critical Elements of this Framework .**

\- I**nstitutions dont want the spinoff  and  Insider want the spinoff.**

**Institutions don’t want the spinoff and reduce stake in new company** (They have structural reasons for that and it has nothing to do with the companies fundamentals)

* Spinoff companies are much smaller than parent companies, this makes the size of new business too small for an institutional portfolio, which only contain companies with much larger market capitalisations.
* Many funds(Large cap funds, index funds and etf) can only own shares of companies included in Nifty and Sensex. **So the new division will be subject to huge amount of indiscriminate selling.This gives us the opportunity to pick up shares as a lower price after the spinoff.**
* **Acc to Penn State Study, the largest stock gains for spinoff company comes not in the first year but 2nd year. It may take a full year or 15-20% decline for the initial selling pressure to wear off before the spinoff stock can perform at its best(This is a 30 year study that was focused only on spinoffs)**

**Insiders want the spinoff and have stake in the new company** (This reflect that the parent company believes that their will be growth and value creation for them in this new company, in several cases parent company  don’t hold any stake in the spinoff company which is a big red flag)

* **ITC will maintain a 40% ownership of ITC Hotels, with ITC shareholders acquiring the remaining 60% in proportion to their stake in the parent entity)So the second condition is already fulfilled.**

So with a bit of logic, common sense and experience we can exploit the situation and make money. Its has already declared that ITC will have 40% stake and now if the selling happens by institutions in first few months, both the criteria will be fulfilled and it will be an opportunity to allocate some capital.

I **have used this strategy on Danaher spinoff of Verlato in 2023 and it worked. The stock got listed on $84 went to $68in next few months AND currently trading at $102.**

**Same is happening with Raymond spin off right now** although I haven’t checked whether Raymond has insider stake in Raymond lisfestyle.

So have Patience and Wait and see whether the stock is following similar pattern and **apply it only for spinoffs from high quality company which have good management.**

It’s a bit complicated framework which I have tired to explain in a more simplified version, I hope you find it valuable.

If anyone wants to go into details of this framework ,you can **read chapter 3 of Joel Greenblatt book “You Can Be A Stock Market genius.”**

post,1ins6b5,HUL or ITC?,transfeelings,"I hope this is less provocative than ""What are you buying now?"" — which is what I actually wanted to post. 😌

If one is looking to invest in a Nifty 50 stock (especially FMCG, which seems poised for growth) for the long term at this point—and in subsequent, forthcoming dips—which of the two would you pick, and why? Its PE ratio is still unsatisfactorily high, but I'm more inclined toward buying HUL in a staggard/phased way. It may not have ITC's tobacco-fueled cash flow—it is still, in my view, a company with stronger fundamentals.

Ideally this should have been your cost of acquisition if you had ITC shares in multiples of 10. But since you had 25 shares, you just received 2 ITC-H shares which has increased your cost of acquisition of ITC-H shares. :/ 
Therefore, for you, ideally you should apportion ₹325 per share ( i.e. (₹26*25)/2)).",2025-02-17 05:08:16,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ie85e9/itc_shares_price_should_i_a_change_it_after/,IndianStockMarket

post,1i8qa31,ITC Hotel Shares | Received Email but shares not alloted | SBI Securities,sghegde87,"Hi everyone,

I received an email that my Demat account is credited with ITC Hotel shares with the mention of the date. However, I haven't received those in my demat account. My demat is with SBI Securities. Will there be a delay? Is this normal? Has anyone had the shares reflected in their account?  It says that the listing and trading permission is needed by NSE & BSE. So, is it frozen and that's why not reflecting?  

Tried googling but a lot of contradiction across websites. Anybody knows about this and what should be done? Please let me know.

post,1j8jrgj,FMCG ETF vs ITC,mistresslust69,"As we know from next FY Salary tax is going down , and I am expecting an increase in consumer consumption. Now I have both ITC as well as Icici FMCG ETF ( ITC weight 27% HUL weight 16% rest are 0.5-1% each ). What do you think will be optimal to keep logically ? 

My Analysis : ETF has high weightage in ITC already , and individual stock performs better relative to ETF in most case, since I have good risk tolerance , it would be better to keep ITC and use capital allocated to ETF somewhere. 

Both are in green so selling won't be an issue , I am looking for long term (4-5 yrs) so no problem with recent sell offs. Any EXPERT advise would be welcomed. ",2025-03-11 05:35:52,5.0,4.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1j8jrgj/fmcg_etf_vs_itc/,IndianStockMarket

post,1ie9nli,ITC demerger unfolding exactly as expected.Frameworks Matter,SuperbPercentage8050,"""A month ago, I laid out a framework for ITC’s demerger. Now, as events play out exactly as expected, those who missed it can look back, reassess, and align their investments accordingly.""

The stock has already corrected 15%, making it a good point to allocate 30% of your planned investment.For every additional 5% drop, allocate another 10%. This way, you’ll build your position in a structured, disciplined manner. For example, if you plan to invest 1 lakh in the stock, start by allocating 30K and build your position gradually.

# The Demerger Framework and How To Apply it on ITC. 

# This Investing strategy has generated a 30.8%compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over 17 years for Joel Greenblatt.

* (Index S&P 500 gave a CAGR of 9.5% during that period)

It was Designed by **Joel Greenblatt** and mentioned in his book **""You Can Be A Stock Market Genius""** 

The Demerger Framework.

**Major reasons why companies pursue Demerger and how to benefit from them**

* **To unlock hidden value that is otherwise not recognised** by the market when the company is viewed as a conglomerate.**(ITC’s hotel business has been overshadowed by the company’s larger FMCG and paperboard businesses. By demerging the hotel business, ITC will allow the market to re-evaluate the value of this segment independently.This could lead to the hotel business being undervalued at first, because institutional investors who are focused on FMCG or other sectors may sell off the stock.)**
* **The parent company can better allocate capital to its most profitable segments**, improving its overall capital efficiency and profitability.\*\*(\*\*After the hotel business is demerged, ITC will be able to focus more on its FMCG,Smoke, paperboard, and packaging segments, which are higher-margin and less capital-intensive compared to the hotel business.**This could allow ITC to allocate capital more efficiently and potentially increase the profitability of its remaining divisions**.)
* By spinning off a business, both the **parent company and the new company can focus on what they do best**.When a business is freed from large corporate parent, entrepreneurial forces are unleashed in the new division .This can lead to better performance and greater growth potential for both businesses.
* To appeal to a more specific group of investors.The parent company may attract investors interested in more mature, stable businesses, while the spinoff may attract those looking for faster growth or higher risk.
* **Tax, antitrust, regulatory Issue(ITC demerger is not not based on this)**

**You don't need special formulas or mathematical models to make money from spinoff. You just need to exploit the fundamental issues.**

**Two Critical Elements of this Framework .**

\- I**nstitutions dont want the spinoff and Insider want the spinoff.**

**Institutions don't want the spinoff and reduce stake in new company** (They have structural reasons for that and it has nothing to do with the companies fundamentals)

* Spinoff companies are much smaller than parent companies, this makes the size of new business too small for an institutional portfolio, which only contain companies with much larger market capitalisations.
* Many funds(Large cap funds, index funds and etf) can only own shares of companies included in Nifty and Sensex. **So the new division will be subject to huge amount of indiscriminate selling.This gives us the opportunity to pick up shares as a lower price after the spinoff.**
* **Acc to Penn State Study, the largest stock gains for spinoff company comes not in the first year but 2nd year. It may take a full year or 15-20% decline for the initial selling pressure to wear off before the spinoff stock can perform at its best(This is a 30 year study that was focused only on spinoffs)**

**Insiders want the spinoff and have stake in the new company** (This reflect that the parent company believes that their will be growth and value creation for them in this new company, in several cases parent company don't hold any stake in the spinoff company which is a big red flag)

* **ITC will maintain a 40% ownership of ITC Hotels, with ITC shareholders acquiring the remaining 60% in proportion to their stake in the parent entity)So the second condition is already fulfilled.**

So with a bit of logic, common sense and experience we can exploit the situation and make money. Its has already declared that ITC will have 40% stake and now if the selling happens by institutions in first few months, both the criteria will be fulfilled and it will be an opportunity to allocate some capital.

I **have used this strategy on Danaher spinoff of Verlato in 2023 and it worked. The stock got listed on $84 went to $68in next few months AND currently trading at $102.**

**Same is happening with Raymond spin off right now** although I haven't checked whether Raymond has insider stake in Raymond lisfestyle.

So have Patience and Wait and see whether the stock is following similar pattern and **apply it only for spinoffs from high quality company which have good management.**

It's a bit complicated framework which I have tired to explain in a more simplified version, I hope you find it valuable.

If anyone wants to go into details of this framework ,you can **read chapter 3 of Joel Greenblatt book ""You Can Be A Stock Market genius.""**

Happy Investing!

post,1e4uuaw,"Investing in Largecaps like Reliance, Infosys, Wipro, TCS, ITC will not give you multibagger returns ever. You need to start investing in Smallcap, Microcaps, and a good midcap to get multibaggers and make a multibagger portfolio.",Personal_Common_4437,"Investing in large-cap companies like Reliance, Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and ITC may not yield multibagger returns. For significant gains, consider small-cap, micro-cap, and select mid-cap stocks. Let’s explore why and how these investments can be more rewarding.

How Does a Stock Become a Multibagger?
Low Price and Low Market Capitalization (Mcap):
A stock is low-priced when it has a low Mcap, often due to existing negatives or concerns in the market.
Market participants tend to overlook these stocks because of these perceived negatives, keeping their prices low.
The Investment Strategy
Identifying Potential Multibaggers:

As investors seeking multibagger returns, our goal is to identify and invest in stocks that the market is not currently favoring.
Once the negative aspects are resolved, the stock’s value can significantly increase.
Example:

Consider a small-cap stock in the pharmaceutical sector, such as Laurus Labs. Initially, it may have faced issues with regulatory approvals, keeping its price low. Once these hurdles were overcome, the stock saw substantial growth, becoming a multibagger.
The Common Misconception
Expecting Perfect Fundamentals at Low Prices:

It is unrealistic to find a stock priced at 20 with perfect fundamentals. Such stocks will naturally have some negatives.
Large-cap stocks with a Mcap of 10,000 crores or more have often already delivered significant returns. Expecting them to become multibaggers from this point is impractical.
Example:

Infosys, a leading IT company, has a high Mcap and has already provided substantial returns over the years. Expecting it to continue delivering multibagger returns is unrealistic.
The Potential of Smaller Mcap Stocks
Smaller Mcap Stocks Have Higher Growth Potential:

Stocks with a Mcap of 200 crores can grow to 2,000 crores, providing a tenfold return.
Similarly, a stock with a Mcap of 500 crores can grow to 5,000 crores, offering significant returns.
Example:

Consider a company like Avanti Feeds, which had a lower Mcap but expanded its business significantly, leading to multibagger returns.
Understanding Market Saturation
Saturation Point and Valuation:

After a certain Mcap, a stock’s growth potential diminishes, making it harder to achieve multibagger status.
Stocks with Mcaps above 10,000 crores require extraordinary growth to become multibaggers, which is challenging.
Example:

Tata Motors, with a high Mcap, would need exceptional growth in sales and profitability to double or triple its value, which is less likely compared to smaller companies.
Simple Rules for Stock Market Success
Buy Less Discussed Stocks:

Investing in under-the-radar stocks can yield high returns as they are often undervalued.
Buy Underowned Stocks:

Stocks with low institutional ownership may have greater growth potential once discovered.
Look for Multibagger Prospects:

Focus on companies with the potential for significant growth rather than those that have already delivered high returns.
Avoid Stocks That Are Already Multibaggers:

Stocks that have already provided substantial returns may have limited future growth.
Consider Mcap:

Always evaluate the Mcap to understand the potential for future growth. Stocks with lower Mcaps generally have higher growth potential.
By following these guidelines and focusing on small-cap, micro-cap, and promising mid-cap stocks, investors can build a portfolio with the potential for multibagger returns. Remember, the key lies in identifying undervalued opportunities and being patient as these stocks realize their growth potential.",2024-07-16 17:40:44,4.0,26.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1e4uuaw/investing_in_largecaps_like_reliance_infosys/,IndianStockMarket

Power of compounding is more rewarding that multi bagger

Large cap when compounding for long time became multi bagger but small cap and medium cap became multi bagger if ROCE is not there like large cap compounding doesn't work

3rd one is buying in market dips 


Tata motors was 70 rupees in 2020 now 1000 10x
Many large cap gave such return but not many small cap gave such returns during 2020 because of sting fundamental to overcome covid.. same in 2008, and 2000 crashes


If market is high and u want high return in large cap ur investment should be higher like 5 lakh to 10 lakh so you would get best and solid return like 2x or 2.5 x return return so 
10lakh becomes 25 lakh in 3 years but I won't invest 10lakh in one small cap thinking it will become 1 crore

I would put in high investment in apple and oranges and not in unknown fruit believing it becomes next apple and oranges

Long-term satisfaction is better than shorterm happiness in stock market.

You plan to make 1rupee to  10 rupee , I plan 10 rupee into 30 rupee .. urs is 10x mine is 2x but I earn 10rupees more than you . You search 100 company to put 1 rupee , I search 10 company to pute 10 rupees ..

post,1iftd5w,ITC Hotels cost of acquisition / Tax loss harvesting opportunity,getprshah,"There's a good opportunity in **ITC Hotels** for those who are looking for **Tax loss harvesting**.

The apportioned cost of acquisition for ITC Hotels is **13.51%** of the total amount invested in ITC Ltd pre-demerger. (Source: BSE: *https://www.itcportal.com/about-itc/shareholder-value/pdf/lodr-28jan25.pdf*)

""For example, if 1,000 Ordinary Shares of ITC were purchased at **400/-** per share by a shareholder, the total cost of acquisition would amount to 4,00,000/- before the demerger. Based on the Share Entitlement Ratio, 100 shares of ITCHL would be allotted to the said shareholder. The total cost of acquisition of **4,00,000/-** would be apportioned in the aforesaid ratio - **3,45,960/-** (86.49% of 4,00,000/-) being the total cost of acquisition of 1,000 ITC shares and **54,040/-** (13.51% of  4,00,000/-) being the total cost of acquisition of 100 shares of ITCHL.""

The holding price of **ITC Hotels** for most allottee should be hugely BELOW the current market price, and this is the **tax loss harvesting opportunity**.

Continuing the example above; the allotment price of Rs **540.40** is hugely below the current market price of **170.75** (LTP AOD 01.Feb.2025). So selling one's holding and then purchasing it back the following session should allow a tax deductible loss of *Rs 369.65* (as per the example price) per share.

  
YMMV depending on your cost of acquisition.",2025-02-02 09:06:22,1.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1iftd5w/itc_hotels_cost_of_acquisition_tax_loss/,IndianStockMarket

post,1hhrdfe,"Should you BUY ahead of ITC Hotels demerger record date?
",ZestycloseJudgment89,"https://preview.redd.it/f7ch3470ps7e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdae9d76e0fa171297c39f1eb6e0e35d3d9722cf

ITC has set January 6, 2025, as the record date for the ITC Hotels demerger. The company also acquired stakes in EIH Ltd (2.44%) and HLV Ltd (0.53%). With these developments, ITC shares are back in focus. Should you buy ITC shares before the demerger?

The stock is consolidating near its 40 week EMA after previously trading above it. The 40 week EMA and trendline support coincide around 467, marking it as a strong support level. On the weekly chart, the RMI is yet to give a bullish crossover. A buying opportunity may arise if the RMI confirms a bullish crossover and the price closes above the 20 week SMA of the Bollinger Bands.Should you BUY ahead of ITC Hotels demerger record date?

ITC might stay at \~400 for a long time. Then one day decide that's enough and move up to 600. You never know when. It stayed at 200 for a really long time, since about 2013.   
  
What the charts don't tell you is that ITC also paid out hefty dividends all this time. So you made 4-6% returns as dividends and then the capital pretty much doubled last year. Many real estate investments do not give this returns.

But only add qty if you are investing for long term and if you believe in the company. Otherwise take SL.

4. If this week it closes above 450 then there will be pattern of 3 white soldiers on weekly which will be another good sign + trendline breakout so closing above 457-460 is important number to watch for.

post,1igj3pu,"STOCK MARKET CRASH AFTER BUDGET 2025 IS THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO RETAIL INVESTORS – CRY MORE, PAPER HANDS!""",masterbaras,"Let the tears flow from the ""experts"" and institutional clowns 🤡 who are panic-selling today. While Sensex tanked \~750 points and Nifty kissed 23,226. The REAL INVESTORS are rubbing their hands like Thanos snapping half the universe. Here’s why these ""crashes"" are a BLESSING:

1.FOREIGNERS DUMPING SHARES? THANK THEM FOR THE DISCOUNT!

FIIs sold ₹1,327 CRORE worth of stocks post-Budget. Good riddance! These guys have been net sellers since October 2024, and now they’re handing us CHEAP BLUE-CHIPS on a silver platter. Tata Steel, L&T, NTPC – all down 3-4%? I’ll take your entire stock!

2. TRUMP’S TARIFF TANTRUM = BLACK FRIDAY SALE

25% tariffs on Mexico/Canada and 10% on China? Global markets panicking? WHO CARES. This isn’t 2018. The Modi govt’s tax cuts (₹12.75L income = ZERO TAX) will unleash a CONSUMPTION BOOM for FMCG, autos, and durables. Maruti, ITC, Dabur at discounts? Load. The. Boat.

3. MID/SMALLCAP BLOODBATH? PERFECT TIME TO BUY FUTURE MULTIBAGGERS

BSE Midcap/Smallcap down 1-8%? Bharat Dynamics, JP Power, IREDA getting slaughtered? Yes, please! Retail investors with DIAMOND HANDS know corrections are where fortunes are made. Remember 2020? Exactly.

4. ""BUT WHAT ABOUT RBI POLICY UNCERTAINTY!"" – STFU AND BUY

The rupee’s at 87/USD, and RBI might cut rates? EVEN BETTER. Cheaper loans = more spending = auto, real estate, and consumer stocks 📈. Weak hands are selling because they can’t handle volatility. We feast on their fear.

5. GOVT’S ""LACK OF CAPEX"" IS A SMOKESCREEN

Sure, railway/defense/infra stocks dipped, but the Budget’s ₹500Cr AI fund and MSME credit boost are LONG-TERM WINNERS. Paperhands crying about ""no capex"" don’t understand strategic plays.

CONCLUSION: This ""crash"" is a FIRE SALE for those with vision. The FII exodus and Trump’s meltdown are clearing the path for retail investors to DOMINATE. Stay greedy, buy the dip, and let the panic-sellers fund your retirement.

post,1iwaf7a,"After a year-and-half of conflict, the Burmans finally own Religare. Rashmi Saluja, the former chairperson, tried everything but failed to stall it",tareekpetareek,"*Original Source:* [*https://boringmoney.in/p/burman-open-offer-religare-promoter*](https://boringmoney.in/p/burman-open-offer-religare-promoter?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=religare+burman+saluja) *(my newsletter Boring Money, if you like what you read, please subscribe to receive future posts directly in your inbox)*

\--

There’s a bit of a weird understanding around company ownership in India. If you’re out in the market looking to take control of a listed company, sure, you should lap up as many of the company’s shares as you can. Intuitively, you would need to buy at least 51% of the company’s stock to get control. But not in India! Even if you own less than that, if the company marks you as a “promoter”, you end up effectively owning \[1\] the company.

There’s quite a bit of confusion and conflict around this understanding. Sometimes the founder and CEO of a company owning 10% doesn’t want to be called the promoter, but is [forced to](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/vijay-shekhar-sharma-paytm-directors-face-sebi-show-cause-notices-over-ipo-breaches-12806852.html). Other times an investor who owns 17% [cannot remove](https://www.medianama.com/2021/10/223-explained-zee-invesco-summary/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) a promoter holding less than 4%.

Being a promoter is a state of being. You don’t need a large stake. If you’re calling the shots day-to-day, you’re a promoter. It works the other way too. If you don’t control a company just yet, but want to, you better get yourself put down as a promoter. It’s like drawing a superpower from within the soul of the company that gives you the permission and access to decide how it works.

This week, the Burman family, who are the promoters of the Ayurvedic brand Dabur, also [became the promoters](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/burman-family-acquires-control-become-promoters-of-religare-enterprises-125022001226_1.html) of Religare Enterprises, a financial services conglomerate. They were in the market to own about 51% of Religare, but their offer to buy the public’s shares failed miserably. No matter! They still own 25% of its shares, but more importantly, after a long-drawn conflict, they passed the company’s vibe check and managed to call themselves its promoters.

# An offer that you can refuse

Before this week, Religare did not have a promoter. They did, [once upon a time](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/from-singh-brothers-to-burman-brothers-religares-promoter-blues-continue/articleshow/105266662.cms?from=mdr), but for the last seven years they didn’t. This isn’t a problem. There are large companies like ITC and HDFC Bank without a promoter, and all it means is that there is no one shareholder calling the shots on how the company operates. The shareholders with varying levels of ownership have some representation on the board, which then assigns the CEO, and the CEO reports to the board just as a regular employee would. (And when the CEO leaves, their son or nephew doesn’t take over.)

In September 2023, the Burmans owned \~21% of Religare, which they bought over a few years from the open market. They intended to buy 4% more and exceed 25% in total ownership. There’s a SEBI mandate around such high ownership. If you happen to own 25% of a company’s shares, you have to then offer to buy at least 26% of its remaining shares as well. The idea is that this gives *you* the opportunity to own a controlling stake in the company, and also gives people who may not like you the opportunity to sell their stock to you and get out.

If you’re a serious buyer, your offer to the public had better be more than the stock’s market price. We’re talking about a publicly listed company here—people can sell their shares and move on anyway. The only reason they’d sell to you is if you offered them a better-than-market price for their shares.

When the Burman family first announced their intention to run an offer, Religare’s stock price was around ₹270. The Burmans offered ₹235, a good 13% lower.

The Burmans announced the offer one-and-a-half years back, but it actually happened just last week. And [it failed](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/EFAC8052-C655-4C3B-BC69-8B8C5D55B04A-134530.pdf)! They were out to buy ₹2,116 crore of Religare stock. Shareholders agreed to sell only 0.25% of that, about ₹5.4 crore.

That’s what makes the Burman family’s successful takeover a little weird. They made a shitty offer, it didn’t go through, and yet they control Religare? Tell me if being a promoter isn’t a state of being.

# She does not give up

There are two things I want to mention about Rashmi Saluja, one of them totally irrelevant to this story.

1. Until last week, she was the executive chairperson of Religare.
2. She was [deboarded](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-kicks-out-troublesome-head-of-a-top-financial-company-as-she-was-rude/articleshow/108285668.cms?from=mdr) from an Air India flight for being rude to the crew.

Saluja had been the chairperson since [December 2019](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/a7a2e5c3-6e03-4b41-998b-bd6ad741896a.pdf) (the deboarding happened last year) at a time when Religare was almost a dead company because its founders [stole](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-court-frames-criminal-conspiracy-charges-former-religare-enterprises-promoters-loss-firm-9784145/) from the company. I don’t know how Religare turned around, but it did. Saluja had been the chairperson all this while so looks like she did a [good job](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/rashmi-saluja-steered-religare-2-0-through-upheaval-changed-firms-fortunes/articleshow/93994326.cms?from=mdr) with it.

>\[[Image Link](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F447409d6-68c7-4b44-b7f1-7b461d0a52b8_653x408.png)\]

Saluja did not want the Burmans to take over Religare. Makes sense to me. If you’re a corporate turnaround artist at a financial services company, you wouldn’t want the company to be taken over by a billionaire family selling [adulterated honey](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/health/honey-fraud-our-response-to-statements-from-dabur-patanjali-74512). But just how far do you go to keep your job?

Pretty far. Here’s a bit from [earlier this month](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-rashmi-saluja-moves-court-again-religare-board-fights-back-3746738/) from the Financial Express:

>The battle for control of Religare Enterprises (REL) has started looking like a never-ending soap opera. On Tuesday, Rashmi Saluja, the ousted executive chairperson of REL, made the first move by filing a fresh writ petition in the Delhi High Court, seeking to quash the open offer by the Burman family-led entities. This marks the seventh legal attempt by her to stall the takeover process. The court is expected to hear her petition on Wednesday (today).

Seventh legal attempt! Saluja does not give up. \[2\]

# Fit and proper!

Religare is a holding company for a brokerage, an insurance company, and an NBFC, among other smaller businesses. For the Burman family to become the promoter, they had to get the approval of the regulator for each line of business. That’s SEBI for being a broker, IRDAI for insurance, and RBI for the NBFC.

It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me, but someone looking to buy a company like Religare, cannot apply directly to the regulators for approval. Instead, the company itself has to go to its regulators and say “hey this guy’s looking to buy me, are you okay if we let him run an offer for our shareholders to consider?”. The company does have some discretion here. If a potential acquirer isn’t credible, it need not go to the regulators and waste their time. But the Burmans already owned 21% of Religare, obviously had the means to buy more, so Religare didn’t really have any room for discretion.

And yet, Religare’s board, led by Saluja, decided that it did not want to take the Burmans’ offer to the regulators for approval. Apparently the Burmans did not meet the criteria that owners and executives for financial companies must be “fit and proper”.

Fit and proper? That sounds familiar. [We spoke about](https://boringmoney.in/p/embassy-reit-looks-at-a-fraud#:~:text=SEBI%20wanted%20the%20REIT%E2%80%99s%20CEO%20to%20be%20a%20%E2%80%9Cfit%20and%20proper%20person%E2%80%9D%20which%20is%20just%20a%20bunch%20of%20floor%20criteria%20for%20stuff%20like%20not%20having%20defrauded%20anyone%20or%20being%20a%20criminal.%20Embassy%20REIT%E2%80%99s%20argument%20was%20that%20its%20CEO%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20need%20to%20be%20a%20%E2%80%9Cfit%20and%20proper%20person%E2%80%9D%3F!) these criteria last year when a company argued that their CEO need not be fit and proper. Here Religare is arguing that the potential buyer absolutely must be fit and proper, and that it was deciding that they were not. Surely the Burmans must be in some financial soup? No?

From[ From a Mint report](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/bid-to-block-religare-acquisition-burman-family-slams-false-fir-linking-dabur-group-to-mahadev-betting-app-case-11699955913805.html):

>Members of the Dabur group have issued a rebuttal after reports linked its chairman and director to the Mahadev betting app case. The Mumbai Police has reportedly booked 32 people – including Mohit Burman and Gaurav Burman – under various sections of fraud and gambling. A spokesperson for the Burman family however dubbed it a ‘baseless’ accusation that happened to coincide with their bid to acquire Religare Enterprises.

>“We have not received any formal communication on any such FIR. However, we have sighted the FIR which is being circulated to media houses. The FIR is patently false and baseless. Nothing could be further from the truth than as wrongly stated in the FIR,” the spokesperson said.

The Burmans announced that it was going to do an open offer and in a few weeks there were reports that they had an FIR registered against them in an unrelated betting scam. \[3\] Religare used these reports to decide that the Burmans weren’t fit and proper, and wouldn’t even apply for approval to the regulators for good measure.

The Burmans then went to SEBI about this, who eventually forced Religare to actually apply for approval. [This was in June 2024](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jun-2024/interim-order-cum-show-cause-notice-in-the-matter-of-religare-enterprises-limited_84286.html), a good nine months after the Burman family’s initial offer announcement. \[4\]

# Stall, stall, stall

Every year, usually sometime between July and September, every listed company in India holds their annual general meeting. This meeting is when companies are able to get all their important shareholders in one room and have them vote on things that need their approval to go through. Shareholders can also ask the board and executives questions (or share their unsolicited opinions) about the company.

Religare’s annual meeting was scheduled for sometime in September 2024, but the board delayed it to December. From [Mint](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/religare-enterprises-agm-delay-shareholders-rashmi-saluja-investors-burman-family-dabur-11724591594022.html):

>Three institutional shareholders said they were unhappy with the decision to postpone the AGM, especially since the company has given no explanation. The delay becomes crucial as chairperson Rashmi Saluja was up for reappointment at this AGM, initially scheduled for September.

>\[…\]

>Saluja is the only non-independent director on the Religare board and, therefore, comes up for retirement at each AGM. The vote to reappoint her will now take place in December after the company secured approval to defer the AGM by three months.

Saluja needed to win the shareholder vote to be reappointed as the chairperson of Religare. This vote is usually a formality, shareholders like to go for whoever’s being presented. Saluja probably didn’t want to risk it, so the meeting was pushed.

Then in December, some random guy filed a public interest litigation (?) in the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Jabalpur—a city that Religare has absolutely nothing to do with—and the court [asked to](https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/madhya-pradesh-hc-stays-religare-enterprises-agm-in-response-to-pil/119722) wait on the meeting scheduled for 31 December (which by itself is a weird day to hold a meeting). In January, the court [finally allowed](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/madhya-pradesh-high-court-dismisses-pil-religare-agm-rashmi-saluja-125010900673_1.html) the meeting to proceed because it figured that the litigation was BS.

The meeting was then scheduled again for February, and this was challenged in court again! This time by Saluja herself in the Delhi High Court. The court [refused](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/delhi-hc-rejects-rashmi-saluja-s-plea-to-halt-religare-enterprises-agm-125020601716_1.html) to halt the meeting.

On 7 February, the meeting finally took place and [here’s what happened](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-suspense-at-agm-over-reappointment-of-saluja-3741671/):

>The annual general meeting (AGM) of Religare Enterprises on Friday took an interesting turn after chairperson Rashmi Saluja stopped the discussion on her reappointment (agenda 2), stating that she was not liable to retire by rotation, said sources.

>“So, we can ignore resolution number 2,” she said. When an independent director present at the meeting contested her decision, she dismissed the intervention, saying that his remarks should be taken on record.

Saluja still doesn’t give up! In the meeting, she told everyone that she wasn’t due to retire, and so there was no need for everyone to vote on her reappointment. How thoughtful of her to save everyone’s time.

Of course, that wasn’t the end of it. In the physical meeting, she managed to stop people from voting against her by making sure the vote itself didn’t happen. But voting was held online for shareholders who weren’t at the meeting and two days later [97%](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-over-97-religare-shareholders-reject-salujas-reappointment-3744393/) of Religare’s shareholders had voted against her reappointment. She was *finally* removed from her position as executive chairperson.

# It’s a state of being

Back to the Burmans. They wanted to become the promoters of Religare and decide how it should operate. Initially, Religare’s board of directors were against this and resisted to the extent that they could. Later it was just Saluja who remained obstinate to the extent of not even letting the Burmans’ offer reach the shareholders.

Becoming the promoter isn’t just about owning a large stake. Sure, yes, more shares don’t hurt. And beyond 51% there’s not a lot anyone else can do. But with Saluja no longer a board member, there was no one to stop the Burman family from becoming a promoter. So they became the promoter! Like I said, being a promoter is a state of being.

If Saluja hadn’t been booted out, whoever knows what would’ve happened? With the Burmans’ offer practically rejected by shareholders, there is no way she would’ve let Religare name them as the promoters. Eventually, sure, the Burmans would have succeeded. But that would cost time, legal fees, and maybe a lot more money for yet another long-drawn offer.

# Stay out of jail card

Why was Saluja hell bent on halting the Burmans’ offer? Maybe because she paid herself a lot! She held too much sway within the company and figured out a way to earn many multiples more than other executives at the same level. From [the Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/religare-finvest-issued-esops-to-rashmi-saluja-a-day-after-burmans-open-offer/articleshow/106497688.cms?from=mdr):

>\[…\] Rashmi Saluja, executive chairperson of the company, acquired around 8% stake in its wholly-owned shadow bank Religare Finvest Limited (RFL), through an Employees Stock Option Plan (Esop) award, documents reviewed by ET reveal.

>The award in the unlisted subsidiary ascribed its value in a band of Rs150-260 crore. Previously, proxy advisory firm InGovern had estimated the Esops awarded to Saluja in Religare Enterprises as well as its health insurance subsidiary Care Health Insurance to be worth Rs480 crore. Together with the thus far undeclared award of stock options in Religare Finvest, the total compensation earned by Saluja via Esops could be between Rs630 and Rs740 crore. This is in addition to the annual salary and places Saluja among the highest paid executives in Indian corporate history.

Highest paid executive in *Indian corporate history*! \[5\] Most of Saluja’s compensation came from the employee stock options pool of Religare’s subsidiaries, worth anywhere between ₹630 crore to ₹740 crore ($73m to $86m). Her stake was so high that it would represent 8% of Religare’s NBFC! The stock option pool is usually between 5–10%, meant to serve as an incentive for *all* employees to work to get the stock price up and stick around for longer. Saluja hogged the entire thing.

Okay, fighting to stay around as the highest paid executive in Indian corporate history would be alluring. But come on, the annual general meeting was seven days away, and she sued the company she was the chairperson at! And asked shareholders to casually ignore something they were to vote on! That’s extreme.

The Burman family have been [demanding](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/burman-family-demands-sebi-investigation-in-allotment-of-8-esops-shares-to-rfl-chairman-rashmi-saluja-11704286617650.html) an investigation into Saluja’s compensation. If the numbers are true, and they seem to be, Saluja has almost certainly been defrauding the company and its investors. With the Burmans running the company, I wouldn’t be surprised if any documentation around her compensation reached the investigator as a neatly formatted PDF of evidence. That makes her extreme behaviour make a [little bit more](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/ed-summons-religare-chairperson-rashmi-saluja-for-questioning/articleshow/116183872.cms?from=mdr) sense.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] I use “ownership” for promoters liberally, even though they don’t technically own the company. In everyday conversation I think the distinction doesn’t matter.

\[2\] This better be the name of any biography that happens to be written about Saluja.

\[3\] There’s some [dumb stuff happening](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/remote-controlled-plaint-cops-may-quiz-rashmi-saluja/articleshow/118461248.cms) here that I wouldn’t even be able to scratch the surface of.

\[5\] I like how the Economic Times emphasises this, but this may or may not be true! I doubt Saluja would keep getting those stock options every year for life. So not entirely accurate to count it as part of her regular compensation.

post,1e8p9jp,EID Parry - an agriculture titan disguised as a sugar business [OpenSourceInvestor],super_compound,"EID Parry is like that grand old tree in your backyard—rooted deep in history, yet constantly sprouting new branches. It was founded 182 years ago, and if we calculate its lifespan using the [Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect), it will still be around in 2206.

This isn’t just any sugar business; it’s an agricultural titan in disguise, churning out everything from your morning sugar to spirulina, fertilizers and biofuels. So, grab your favourite [Mithai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweets_from_the_Indian_subcontinent), and let’s dive in!

Contents:

6. Conclusion & sources

# Company overview & business model

EID Parry is part of the [Murugappa group](https://mysuccessproject.in/murugappa-group-explore-the-120-years-legacy/), one of the oldest business groups in India with 28+ businesses and a long history of fiduciary responsibility.

* Parry is the largest sugar manufacturer in South India. It started in 1842, when it opened the country’s first ever sugar plant at Nellikuppam, Tamil Nadu
* 30% of the sugar output is sold under the Parry brand, while 70% is sold in bulk.
   * The management team have indicated that they are planning to “move up the value chain”, with more focus on their branded line of sugar and nutraceuticals (spirulina , palmetto etc.).
   * The Indian government curbed [sugar exports in 2023](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/india-extends-curbs-sugar-exports-calm-domestic-prices-2023-10-18/), in order to control domestic sugar prices
   * To combat the sugar business's cyclicality, Parry has also significantly invested in distillery capacity, aligning with the Indian government's plan for increased domestic energy supply.
* Their branded sugar and FMCG business (27% of their revenue) is scaling rapidly, with the number of distribution outlets increasing from 20k in 2021 to 110k currently
* Apart from this, they also have a power generation and sugar refinery businesses, both of which have struggled to maintain profitability. These two business have depressed the margins over the last five years, which were around 1% on average.
* Even if loss-making units break even, margins would only increase to a razor-thin 2-3%, reflecting the commoditized nature of the sugar industry.

# Holding company structure

The Murugappa group took over EID Parry in 1981 and now own 38.3% of business. EID Parry, in turn, owns 56% of Coromandel International, which it had co-founded in the 1960s.

* Coromandel is the largest private phosphatic fertiliser manufacturer, and 2nd largest overall. The company enjoys 60% market share in the ‘Rice Bowl’ regions of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana
* Around half of Coromandel’s sales come from exports, where they see significant headroom for growth
* [IFFCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Farmers_Fertiliser_Cooperative), which is a Fertiliser Cooperative, is the largest fertilizer producer in India, with roughly twice the revenues of Coromandel. Coromandel has been gaining market share, with revenues growing \~11% CAGR since 2019, while IFFCOs sales have remained flat

# Balance sheet and capital allocation

* EID Parry had significant debt before 2020 but has since paid down a majority, leading to a fortress-like balance sheet and net cash of ₹23 billion (₹2300 crore) as of March 2024
* This gives them flexibility to invest in sugar-adjacent businesses (like distillery & nutraceuticals) and buy depressed assets during market downturns.
* Capital allocation has been hit-and-miss, with some of their ventures like Coromandel and the sugar distillery investments generating high ROCE , while other ones like the refinery have had very poor returns.
   * Overall , ROCE has been exceptional, averaging 26% since 2017
   * The management has expressed interest in further inorganic expansion in the FMCG space, but they have been pretty prudent so fair in sizing their capital investments, while maintaining a pristine balance sheet
   * Parry have also reduced their Coromandel stake from 60%+ to 56% currently. But don’t seem to have any plans to further trim their position.
* They haven’t fully reinvested their earnings. So, they do pay out dividends and have built up a cash position. An approximate capital deployment break-down over the last few years:
   * 50% re-invested into CAPEX
   * 30% paid out in dividend
   * 20% going to debt repayment or cash reserves

# Valuation

Many of the previous valuations I’ve read online seem to take a comparative valuation approach with a “Hold-Co discount” added on top. However, I chose to employ a discounted cash flow analysis, assuming the earnings of Coromandel will flow through to EID Parry shareholders eventually, either via dividends or incremental equity ownership.

Warren Buffett follows a similiar approach, by using “[look-though earnings](https://mastersinvest.com/newblog/2017/2/19/the-buffett-series-focus-on-the-earnings)” to value Berkshire Hathaway and other holding companies. Subsidiaries should only pay dividends if they cannot re-invest capital in their business at a high hurdle rate.

My estimates for value per share are given below. The full assumptions can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lm1JZtfuQudOFddkLIAPrMp7RLtx5_Zj/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114836972199643253007&rtpof=true&sd=true). 

[Value per share](https://imgur.com/lZDYxbz)

* Bear:  **₹645**
* Base: **₹911**
* Bull: **₹1,267**

Notes:

* The Coromandel stake represents \~70% of EID Parry’s value per share, so it forms a core part of the investment thesis. At current prices, you are essentially getting the sugar business and assets for “free”, as the Coromandel stake and net cash are worth ₹755
* If I valued the Coromandel stake at their current market price instead of using a discounted cash flow method, EID’s 56% ownership of Coromandel equals ₹1112 per share (after subtracting 25% in taxes) - 20% higher than my bull case estimate of ₹914. The markets seem to be valuing Coromandel with double-digit growth expectations for the next decade.

I had initially bought EID Parry in March 2022 and added to my position subsequently, so my average cost is ₹508 (much lower than current levels). The stock now looks close to fairly valued, with the gap between price and value narrowing significantly since the beginning of 2024. The stock currently represents 10% of my India portfolio - I plan to hold it for the next several years (or ideally forever).

[PPFAS](https://amc.ppfas.com/), a mutual fund I follow, has also invested in EID Parry since January 2024. However, it currently represents a small portion (0.2%) of their flexi-cap fund. They appear to have stopped adding to their position since February 2024, when the share price was around ₹600.

# Future growth potential

The current stock price seems fairly valued, but provides some free “call options” that I haven’t consider yet in the valuation:

* EID Parry
   * Indian sugar consumption could grow significantly: Indian per-capita consumption is around [22kg per year](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sugar-projections-consumption-per-capita_5jrzxx43xv37.pdf), while developed countries are at [36kg per year](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sugar-projections-consumption-per-capita_5jrzxx43xv37.pdf).
   * The Indian government drops the sugar export ban, leading to higher sugar realization prices
   * The Indian government ramps up the Ethanol blending program to reduce reliance on energy imports (similiar to [Brazil](https://www.energy-observer.org/resources/bioethnaol-brazilian-success-story))
   * FMCG grows to become a significant part of the business (similiar to [ITC](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/itcs-fmcg-business-set-to-touch-4-billion-mark/articleshow/111352796.cms)’s successful scale-up)
   * The freehold land bank owned by EID Parry, which they estimate to be valued at ₹394 Cr (or ₹22 per share of EID Parry)
* Coromandel could significantly ramp up export volumes: their current capacity is 4.5MMT (million metric ton), while the largest global crop nutrient manufacturers are close to [20\~30MMT](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1266558/plant-capacity-largest-fertilizer-manufacturers-worldwide/)

# Risks

* EID Parry
   * Global sugar prices plummet lower than EID’s production costs, leading to under-utilization and losses
   * The Indian government sets the MSP (minimum support price) for sugar purchases from farmers and could end up squeezing EID’s sugar margins.
   * Poor monsoons or pest related issues in South India, leading to lower sugar cane yields
* Coromandel faces significant litigation risks related to toxic chemical handling. The most recent example was a [gas leak at Ennore on Dec 2023](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chennai/ennore-gas-leak-tamil-nadu-govt-panel-coromandel-pay-penalty-9144811/), which resulted in a fine of ₹6 Cr.

# Conclusion

EID Parry appears to be well positioned, both on the production and consumption side of India’s agriculture food chain.

There are a bunch of article on just price movement, but almost no one is doing an analysis on the company itself, it's fundamental, moats etc. 
Everyone is on 150-3000 price range. Acquire more hotel in tier2-3 and revenue to be stable and ITC has 40% stake so chill.

comment,1kj3i41,,,,,,,mrkhfmd,fRilL3rSS,"I am an ex-hotelier and have graduated from IHM Pusa. ITC is one of the premier hotel chain in India. What sets them apart from Oberoi and Tata and international hotels is that their work environment is almost govt like, standard pay for all employees, strict working limits of 9 hours for all staff (permanent and trainees), cafeteria food is great, etc. All weekly offs were given without any lapses. 

The same is not a norm for the entire hotel industry in India. Long working hours, low pay, no benefits nothing. Most people who intend to keep working in hotel line and join ITC, they spend their life in it. It's one of the best hotels to work for, and any company that can keep their employees happy, is bound to flourish. 

When I did my internship at ITC Sonar in 2015, most hotels in Delhi, Mumbai etc offered ₹750-1000 per month stipend, with approx 14 hour shifts. ITC gave everyone all over India ₹1000 stipend with strict 9 hour shifts. Mind you this 4 month internship is part of hotel management curriculum for the degree provided by IHMs all over India. So there is no minimum wage that companies have to give here. 

Most customers I interacted with were repeat customers of ITC and they came back either because they liked the food or the overall service of the hotel. The restaurants are almost always packed every night, as evident by the restaurant manager's face after it closes for the night.",2025-05-10 10:43:33,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1kj3i41/views_in_itc_hotels/,StockMarketIndia
comment,1kj3i41,,,,,,,mrphalt,fRilL3rSS,"I don't think my experience from 2015 still applies to the entire hotel industry, especially after covid which changed a lot of things, but I'll try to explain as best as I can:

>How much of this translates to operational efficiency? Like employee retention must be great but its a double edge sword

You are right. Most of the employees in higher up positions are old, some people who work in entry level positions are old (they have been doing that for their entire life). It is a double edged sword, but the hotel industry is a bit different when it comes to labor work.You'll always have contract workers available for menial and heavy lifting tasks. So older permanent employees who have more experience can manage a lot of contract workers themselves, often handling entire sub-departments. Newer permanent employees often end up working the same tasks as the contract workers so they can learn how it goes. Employees with the most experience are often the master of their art, like the biryani chef who made the entire hotel's biryani at Sonar.

>Second how much push have you seen for ashirwad products, itc frozen food products, sunfeasts and chocolates etc integration?

Almost anything that ITC makes that can be used as raw material for the kitchen, was exclusively used. Customer facing products like cookies and cakes were baked at the in-house bakery, so you might not see Sunfeast cookies on a platter near lounges. Frozen processed products are not used. Everything is made in-house. The only frozen products were meat like salmon that had to be imported.

>How is the room occupancy throughout the year compared to other places?

Hotel's occupancy is cyclical in nature. During seasonal holidays everything is overbooked, rooms, banquets etc. During off-seasons we may run on 30-40% occupancy. All major hotels rely on the December and wedding season for their bulk revenue. Business travellers and celebrities also account for a good portion. During the IPLs entire cricket teams along with their personnel stay in these hotels. But a lot might have changed during or after covid.",2025-05-11 05:49:14,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1kj3i41/views_in_itc_hotels/,StockMarketIndia

Couple of questions... How much of this translates to operational efficiency?

ITC has set January 6, 2025, as the record date for the ITC Hotels demerger. The company also acquired stakes in EIH Ltd (2.44%) and HLV Ltd (0.53%). With these developments, ITC shares are back in focus. Should you buy ITC shares before the demerger?

The stock is consolidating near its 40 week EMA after previously trading above it. The 40 week EMA and trendline support coincide around 467, marking it as a strong support level. On the weekly chart, the RMI is yet to give a bullish crossover. A buying opportunity may arise if the RMI confirms a bullish crossover and the price closes above the 20 week SMA of the Bollinger Bands.",2024-12-19 11:58:06,2.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1hhrbv9/should_you_buy_ahead_of_itc_hotels_demerger/,StockMarketIndia

comment,1igjgjo,,,,,,,mapiwtn,Print_Proof,"ITC Hotels EBITDA for FY23-24 stood at ₹1,058 crore, with a net profit expected to be in the range of ₹850-900 crore.

As for this year, we’ll have to wait and see. However, the company should easily surpass a ₹1,000 crore net profit, keeping the P/E ratio around 32-35x at most. It could also settle between 27-30x, considering that profits should have been stronger this time, given that ITC transferred all hotel-related investments to ITC Hotels, except for its stake in EIH.

Qty : as per discrepancy shown in Zerodha

Avg price : 13.51% of your holding value of ITC divided by the qty of ITC hotels received

Type: others

For average price, here's an example to calculate:

""For example, if 1,000 Ordinary Shares of ITC were purchased at 400/- per share by a shareholder, the total cost of acquisition would amount to 4,00,000/- before the demerger. Based on the Share Entitlement Ratio, 100 shares of ITCHL would be allotted to the said shareholder. The total cost of acquisition of 4,00,000/- would be apportioned in the aforesaid ratio - 3,45,960/- (86.49% of 4,00,000/-) being the total cost of acquisition of 1,000 ITC shares and 54,040/- (13.51% of 4,00,000/-) being the total cost of acquisition of 100 shares of ITCHL.""",2025-02-03 11:18:20,6.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1iglrlh/itc_hotel_descripancy_in_zerodha_kite_what_to/,IndianStreetBets

The price of ITC hotel is showing 709.48 instead of listed price & with a loss of 76.14%. Why so ?

Can anyone explain it to me with proper calculation?


According to the official filing by ITC

I remember British American Tobbaco (BAT) announced that they would sell the ITC Hotels stake and I read on the different thread that the Nifty 50 Index Funds which got the ITC Hotels stock have to start selling them as per the index funds mandate. Based on them I have the following questions,

1. Will the Index Funds start selling the ITC Hotels by Saturday or Monday?  
2. When do you expect BAT to sell their shares on ITC Hotels?

ITC has set January 6, 2025, as the record date for the ITC Hotels demerger. The company also acquired stakes in EIH Ltd (2.44%) and HLV Ltd (0.53%). With these developments, ITC shares are back in focus. Should you buy ITC shares before the demerger?

The stock is consolidating near its 40 week EMA after previously trading above it. The 40 week EMA and trendline support coincide around 467, marking it as a strong support level. On the weekly chart, the RMI is yet to give a bullish crossover.
