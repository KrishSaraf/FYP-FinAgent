SEE IN THE RECENT PAST ALL MAJOR SHARE OF IT DOWN WHETHER ITS INFOSYS, TCS OR WIPRO BUT THE WIPRO BEAT THE

NOW I WISH TO ADD ALL THREE MAJOR SHRES INFOSYS, TCS AND WIPRO BUT TODAY I CHECK THE BUSINESS MODEL OF ALL THREE MAOR IT AND

FOUND THAT INFOSYS AND TCS ARE DEPENDENT ON US MAINLY BUT WIPRO DUE TO MIX BUSINESS MODEL NEVER KEEP DEPEND 100% ON US. MORE THAN 80 % INVESTOR NOT AWARE

ABOUT HOW MANY BUSINESS ARMS IN THE WIPRO COMPANY. ANY WAY I SHARE TO ALL .

Wipro offers a wide range of products and services spanning IT, consulting, business process outsourcing (BPO), and consumer goods. Their services include IT infrastructure, cloud computing, cybersecurity, digital transformation, and artificial intelligence, while their product offerings include consumer care items like soaps, toiletries, and lighting solutions.

post,1k6oshx,"India’s AI Push: What it could mean for top IT companies like Infosys, TCS & Wipro",Opto_themes,"India has historically trailed the US and China when it comes to AI investment — just $21.8bn over the past decade compared to $455bn in the US and $92.7bn in China. But the government’s new $1.2bn IndiaAI strategy suggests that's starting to change, with the plan including building a domestic LLM and making 10,000 GPUs available to startups and researchers.

We've explored some of the top IT companies: Infosys is working on 400+ AI projects, TCS just crossed $30bn in annual revenue, partly thanks to AI-led deals. Wipro says AI is now central to almost every client conversation, and it's locked in over $5bn in large deals this year.

Do you think this shift is enough to create a real tailwind for Indian IT over the next few years?",2025-04-24 10:24:14,1.0,5.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1k6oshx/indias_ai_push_what_it_could_mean_for_top_it/,IndianStockMarket

post,1e4uuaw,"Investing in Largecaps like Reliance, Infosys, Wipro, TCS, ITC will not give you multibagger returns ever. You need to start investing in Smallcap, Microcaps, and a good midcap to get multibaggers and make a multibagger portfolio.",Personal_Common_4437,"Investing in large-cap companies like Reliance, Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and ITC may not yield multibagger returns. For significant gains, consider small-cap, micro-cap, and select mid-cap stocks. Let’s explore why and how these investments can be more rewarding.

How Does a Stock Become a Multibagger?
Low Price and Low Market Capitalization (Mcap):
A stock is low-priced when it has a low Mcap, often due to existing negatives or concerns in the market.
Market participants tend to overlook these stocks because of these perceived negatives, keeping their prices low.
The Investment Strategy
Identifying Potential Multibaggers:

As investors seeking multibagger returns, our goal is to identify and invest in stocks that the market is not currently favoring.
Once the negative aspects are resolved, the stock’s value can significantly increase.
Example:

Consider a small-cap stock in the pharmaceutical sector, such as Laurus Labs. Initially, it may have faced issues with regulatory approvals, keeping its price low. Once these hurdles were overcome, the stock saw substantial growth, becoming a multibagger.
The Common Misconception
Expecting Perfect Fundamentals at Low Prices:

It is unrealistic to find a stock priced at 20 with perfect fundamentals. Such stocks will naturally have some negatives.
Large-cap stocks with a Mcap of 10,000 crores or more have often already delivered significant returns. Expecting them to become multibaggers from this point is impractical.
Example:

Infosys, a leading IT company, has a high Mcap and has already provided substantial returns over the years. Expecting it to continue delivering multibagger returns is unrealistic.
The Potential of Smaller Mcap Stocks
Smaller Mcap Stocks Have Higher Growth Potential:

Stocks with a Mcap of 200 crores can grow to 2,000 crores, providing a tenfold return.
Similarly, a stock with a Mcap of 500 crores can grow to 5,000 crores, offering significant returns.
Example:

Consider a company like Avanti Feeds, which had a lower Mcap but expanded its business significantly, leading to multibagger returns.
Understanding Market Saturation
Saturation Point and Valuation:

After a certain Mcap, a stock’s growth potential diminishes, making it harder to achieve multibagger status.
Stocks with Mcaps above 10,000 crores require extraordinary growth to become multibaggers, which is challenging.
Example:

Tata Motors, with a high Mcap, would need exceptional growth in sales and profitability to double or triple its value, which is less likely compared to smaller companies.
Simple Rules for Stock Market Success
Buy Less Discussed Stocks:

Investing in under-the-radar stocks can yield high returns as they are often undervalued.
Buy Underowned Stocks:

Stocks with low institutional ownership may have greater growth potential once discovered.
Look for Multibagger Prospects:

Focus on companies with the potential for significant growth rather than those that have already delivered high returns.
Avoid Stocks That Are Already Multibaggers:

Stocks that have already provided substantial returns may have limited future growth.
Consider Mcap:

Always evaluate the Mcap to understand the potential for future growth. Stocks with lower Mcaps generally have higher growth potential.
By following these guidelines and focusing on small-cap, micro-cap, and promising mid-cap stocks, investors can build a portfolio with the potential for multibagger returns. Remember, the key lies in identifying undervalued opportunities and being patient as these stocks realize their growth potential.",2024-07-16 17:40:44,3.0,26.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1e4uuaw/investing_in_largecaps_like_reliance_infosys/,IndianStockMarket

comment,1e4uuaw,,,,,,,ldhqodk,Possible-Bite-2826,"This is not  right approach of  multibagger ,it difeers with time range and money contributed

If u think investing 1lakh in a stock and providing 10 to 15lakh return is only multi agger is wrong assumption

Power of compounding is more rewarding that multi bagger

Large cap have compounding effect 
Small cap has multibagger effect 

Large cap when compounding for long time became multi bagger but small cap and medium cap became multi bagger if ROCE is not there like large cap compounding doesn't work

3rd one is buying in market dips 


Tata motors was 70 rupees in 2020 now 1000 10x
Many large cap gave such return but not many small cap gave such returns during 2020 because of sting fundamental to overcome covid.. same in 2008, and 2000 crashes


If market is high and u want high return in large cap ur investment should be higher like 5 lakh to 10 lakh so you would get best and solid return like 2x or 2.5 x return return so 
10lakh becomes 25 lakh in 3 years but I won't invest 10lakh in one small cap thinking it will become 1 crore

I would put in high investment in apple and oranges and not in unknown fruit believing it becomes next apple and oranges

Long-term satisfaction is better than shorterm happiness in stock market.

You plan to make 1rupee to  10 rupee , I plan 10 rupee into 30 rupee .. urs is 10x mine is 2x but I earn 10rupees more than you . You search 100 company to put 1 rupee , I search 10 company to pute 10 rupees ..

post,1iz8i0q,Sold everything - booked 90k loss today and still happy,curioussharma-007,"Hey,

If you are following me in my last posts, I have been doing short selling and cleared 8L in gross profits this month alone. However i entered market in September as an equity investor, started with 12L worth of stocks, they  reached 9L, took loss and finally today booked final loss of 90K.



https://preview.redd.it/x2ac8m4i8mle1.png?width=2574&format=png&auto=webp&s=9baf9a640657e3cb7ee1d9cc63f6a62427b27876

and these are my futures positions as of 10:46 AM today:

https://preview.redd.it/zlcg6zgw8mle1.jpg?width=1023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4abd4aa2fb2c6ba928b7a3a74c5f9bfa9531f70

  
Point being:

People who are asking you to hold, think about it. The fall of market from September till now and in order to make some profits (if you invested after September, 2024) you first need to get NIFTY up at September levels to break even and then further up to make some profit.

Now i only hold 1 Gold ETF and the way I see the market, its going to bleed. As a short seller even 1 day of bleed is a day of immense returns.

There are many new investors sitting on huge loses with confused mind. My POV is, if you need money, take loss, if you can learn shorting then take loss and short however if that is your 'non active' money which you don't care for then let it be there however I don't think should listen to people who use the word 'average it', average of - is the -.

Another point of making this post is, to keep my action today on records permanently so 1 year from now I can look back and conclude on this decision.

Money freed from above stock sales is reinvested as 'shorting' in VOLTAS MAR FUT and HERO MOTOCOP MAR FUT (up by 4k at this moment)

comment,1khr8qn,,,,,,,mr9cghu,Arlysion,"HDFC Bank is currently trading at 1.9k per share. You can buy 4 shares and assuming the bank goes god mode and produces 100% returns a year for 3 years which isn't gonna happen the stock would then be trading at 7.6k per share. So your 9k becomes 30k. In 3 years. You can earn that money through internships over your college years with the right skill in whatever field you choose. 


In a more realistic scenario. Let's say you buy 1 stock at 1.9k. The stock falls to 1.7k. You buy another share. The stock drops to 1.5k. You buy 2 more. Now you're out of capital to average down and you're at the mercy of the market. Overtime the stock will go up but you're not gonna double your money in 3 years.


You can solve this liquidity issue by having more capital. You can have more capital if you make good money. To make good money you need a high paying job. To get a high paying job you need to up your skill. You can buy far more quantity and consistently plan to average down every month after payday if you have a job that pays well. 


Oh and I almost forgot. When you finally make that profit you'll be paying 12.5% of that profit to the government as tax after the brokerages, security tax, gst etc. So keep tabs on the market learn a thing or two from it but try to build or improve your skill in whatever field.",2025-05-08 15:24:31,17.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1khr8qn/i_selected_3_stocks_to_invest/,IndianStockMarket

post,1fpole6,Monthly Analysis of Quant Small Cap Fund ,Jumpy-Dealer209,"This is monthly analysis of Quant Small Cap Fund from Jan. '24 to Aug. '24. The churning rate is insane when compared to other similar funds. Looking at the data of stock quantities, it is easily observed that the fund has been exiting government owned stocks (PSUs) very aggressively and it's much more aggressive after the Lok Sabha elections and Budget 2024 (Railway stocks). Even the recently shining PSU bank stocks like SBI, PNB, etc even after posting amazing quarterly results with least historic NPAs, the fund is not interested in buying fresh quantities rather quitting them aggressively. This might explain why PSUs are falling. Be careful with PSUs.

post,1dwtovh,Companies I have chosen to invest in for long term,Big_Investment28,"Hello everyone! 

So I have picked a few shares for long term investment. And I want you all to have a look and maybe just give your review or opinion as this will be the first time I will be investing in a share. 
I have always heard people say that you should not put all your money in just one sector, you should have a diverse portfolio so I have selected these stocks for each sector.

•**FMCG**- HUL & ITC

•**Tech company**- TCS & Infosys

•**Pharmaceutical**- Lupin & Biocon

•**Finance**- HDFC & SBI, PFC

•**Automobile**- Tata Motors 

•**Metal Mining**- Coal India & Hindustan zinc

•**Infrastructure**- Ambuja cement

•**Defence**- Bharat Electronics.


To select these, I have mainly looked for the company's-

 •**Market cap**(more than 15,000 CR)

•**Debt to equity ratio**(less than 1)

•**Promoter's holding**(more than 50%)

•**Profit, Sales and ROE**(more than 15%)

•**Zero pledge percentage**

No company follows all the above criteria but I choose the one I felt will perform well among its other competitors. 
It would be really helpful if you guys could tell me if I have chosen the right stock, If I should drop a company from the list or add a company. 
I am thinking of buying these soon, I won't buy a lot of quantity as I am new, but still it would be a decent amount so your help would be appreciated. 

Thank you in advance!

comment,1dwtovh,,,,,,,lbxztqo,Magister1995,"Okay sure... 

1. NEVER invest in individual stocks, especially at these valuations. It's insane. Also what if company falls tomorrow, idc how big it is. 

2. Don't buy all in one shot, start a weekly/monthly investment plan. This helps unit cost averaging.

3. Go with roughly this breakdown but slightly adjust based on your risk factor: 70% BROAD market etf or mutual fund. 20% Gov of India debt fund/etf, 10% metal fund/etf.

Ex: MOTILAL OSWAL NIFTY 500 ETF. Buys top 500 biggest companies but also includes mid and small cap companies. 

Why?
Because we don't time the market, it's always a losing bet, especially for long term investing. That's why start SIP regardless of where market is. If it goes down you buy more. Take profits in what the INDEX gives hence you're buying NIFTY 500 or NIFTY 250 broad market fund so you buy little of all companies. Debt fund helps hedge against stock market uncertainty/depression and so does gold fund.

Consistently, top university research has shown broad market instruments like ETF, MF that follow index REGULARLY beat fund managers or individual stocks. Long time in market, and buying close to the WHOLE market will keep your money growing. Don't be an idiot that tries to 10x money overnight.

post,1e9id7b,Why AI Might Hurt Indian IT Stocks: A Simple Explanation,Ok_Pickle_517,"# 

Hey r/IndianStockMarket, let's talk about why AI could be bad news for Indian IT stocks like TCS, Wipro, and Infosys.

# A Story from the Past: BlackBerry

Remember BlackBerry phones? In 2007, they were huge. The iPhone had just come out, but BlackBerry was still doing great. Their stock price was going up.

[BlackBerry Share Price picked in 2017\(at time of Iphone launch\)](https://preview.redd.it/v863wurei3ed1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=225c092b60a145b99e4c52143b9c558ff22eacc3)

But a few years later, BlackBerry was in trouble. The iPhone and Android phones took over.

[USA Market Share of RIM vs Android vs iPhone](https://preview.redd.it/kddcesfii3ed1.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=de7423046cd1f0c0ad2fdb239ed1911779dc2077)

The lesson? Big changes in tech don't always happen right away. They start slow, then suddenly everything changes.

# AI is Coming for IT Jobs

I think something similar is happening now with AI in the IT world. Right now, IT stocks look good. Companies are hiring, and things seem great.

But AI is getting really good at doing IT work. Imagine this:

1. A company tells an AI what they want their software to do.
2. The AI writes the code and tests it.
3. Humans just check the AI's work and make small changes.

This could mean less work for IT companies.

# Why This is Bad for Indian IT Stocks

Companies like TCS, Wipro, and Infosys make money by providing lots of IT workers. But what if clients don't need as many workers because of AI?

1. Clients might hire fewer people from these companies.
2. These companies might have to lower their prices to compete with AI.
3. It's hard for big companies to change how they work quickly.

# What to Watch For

1. Look at how fast companies start using AI for their IT work.
2. Check if IT companies are hiring less or letting people go.
3. See if these companies are making less money per worker.

# What This Means for Investors

The change won't happen overnight. But when it does, it could be big.

You don't need to sell all your IT stocks right away. But it might be smart to start investing in other types of companies too.

What do you think? Is AI a real threat to Indian IT stocks?

comment,1e9id7b,,,,,,,lef2own,d3athR0n,"As someone working day-in-day-out with GenAI, it's not replacing anything or anyone.

It is, however, changing the way companies contract work significantly.


Edit: 

Before you read the rest of it, I want to say, I'm excited about AI but in a positive manner. It's going to change the kind of problems we solve and the complexity and nature of it. It's a great space to be in.


Since I see a lot of people raising similar points in my replies.

- Can it replace things?

Yes. 

- Will it? 

To some extent yes, but it's not nearly as catastrophic as some people are assuming.

- Will it cause layoffs?

We saw a whole wave of layoffs irrespective of the advancements in GenAI. The only significant thing it impacts in the short-term is companies' abilities to build long-term contracts; clients are more tech-aware in the 2020s and everyone's looking for efficiencies on the ""$ spend-to-people employed"" ratio. 

Less with more - that's going to be the game for the rest of this decade. So more than layoffs, we will see ""slowdowns"" in hiring but that too in small phases at best.

- What about AGI?

AGI, while it may happen, is not going to get adopted so easily. Replacing humans in the context and scale of what GenAI is attempting to do will be met with a lot of resistance from a policy and regulatory pov.
We're already seeing this in some instances, there are a few individuals and companies that are either taking their content offline or are aiming to bring in a new path of licensing that prohibits AI companies from training their models on said data.

- A factor that people are not taking as seriously as they should. Cost.

AI companies are eating a lot of cost right now. And while it's safe to assume that ""technology advancements"" over the next 8-10 years will bring down this cost automatically, it's still an assumption.

- Growth Curve

AI has sort of plateau-ed (for the lack of a better word), the growth path hasn't been an exponential curve as we saw when it went from gpt-3 to 3.5 to 4.

- Will it replace service based companies?

Yes and no.

For the ""yes"" part of the answer - it's goign to make lives easy for people, a lot of the trivial work you do is going to get delegated to AI, now if that was the only thing you did as a job then sure you'll get replaced.

The ""no"" part of the answer - context is tough. Codegen and GenAI tend to process problems in a stateless manner and often lack the broader context of what you're trying to do. While the demos for these tools look great, the reality is often not as rosy.

Moreover, natural language is flawed as an input mechanism so make of that what you will.

- How do I figure what's going on with AI?

Try to judge AI as a solitary entity. 

If you hear about AI greatness from people who work in AI and people who are bound to _gain_ from AI - Altman, Nadella, or any investor for that matter - then that's a biased POV.

We saw Devin getting launched but the hype around it is well and truly dead until they come with v2.0

SEE IN THE RECENT PAST ALL MAJOR SHARE OF IT DOWN WHETHER ITS INFOSYS, TCS OR WIPRO BUT THE WIPRO BEAT THE

STREET BY EARN NET PROFITS.

NOW I WISH TO ADD ALL THREE MAJOR SHRES INFOSYS, TCS AND WIPRO BUT TODAY I CHECK THE BUSINESS MODEL OF ALL THREE MAOR IT AND

FOUND THAT INFOSYS AND TCS ARE DEPENDENT ON US MAINLY BUT WIPRO DUE TO MIX BUSINESS MODEL NEVER KEEP DEPEND 100% ON US. MORE THAN 80 % INVESTOR NOT AWARE

ABOUT HOW MANY BUSINESS ARMS IN THE WIPRO COMPANY. ANY WAY I SHARE TO ALL .

Wipro offers a wide range of products and services spanning IT, consulting, business process outsourcing (BPO), and consumer goods. Their services include IT infrastructure, cloud computing, cybersecurity, digital transformation, and artificial intelligence, while their product offerings include consumer care items like soaps, toiletries, and lighting solutions. 

WHEN OTHERS PLAYERS MISS THE NEW DEAL THE WIPRO WON **,**Wipro Wins A £500m Strategic Deal with UK Insurance Giant Phoenix Group.

EVERYONE JUST PUT ON GOOGLE THE LIST OF WIPRO PRODUCTS AND AFTER SEE THE LIST , EVERY ONE SURPRISE TO SEE THAT ITS NOT ONLY A IT COMPANY BUT ALSO A FMCG, INFRASTRURE AS WELL AS CONSUMER PRODUCT COMPANIES.  SO MY PLAN TO ALL THREE SHARES IN THE RATIO OF WIPRO, INFOSYS, TCS IN THE RATIO OF 30 :2:5 RATIO AND THIS PLAN ADOPTED TO KEEP ADD ON EVERY DIP AND KEEP FOR 6 MONTH TO 12 MONTHS FOR THE RETURNS OF 25 TO 30 % IN 3 TO 6 MONTHS",2025-04-22 15:36:53,0.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1k59cv5/wipro_not_only_it_but_also_fmcg_infrastrue_and/,StockMarketIndia

Some stocks only exist just so the promoters can pay themselves/ fill their pockets 

These companies shares trade about 50-80, some even about 100-200, they are barely known to the public.

Very less trading activity (volumes) Few hands involved 

They pay dividends in 100's or 1000's

I don't remember properly but I have seen a share price of about 
Rs. 8

comment,1l2413w,,,,,,,mvqjx5o,Reasonable_Mix_6838,"When you're investing your money, always start with a clear goal—how long you can invest, how much you're willing to put in, and your risk appetite. Don’t just jump in for quick gains or name driven investment sort of things.

If you're serious about returns, look into large-cap stocks or rising companies with solid fundamentals—like consistent profit growth, low or no debt, no promoter pledging, etc. Use tools like Screener.in for basic fundamental analysis and latest news.

A good starting point is comparing the P/E ratio with peer companies in the same sector (Open the stock on screener you will see below all peer with basic numbers, each to make a choice). If it’s significantly lower than industry median, the stock might be undervalued (but always dig deeper—don’t rely on just one metric).

Keep an eye on market sentiment and try to buy on dips if you believe in the company’s long-term potential. Timing + conviction matters. See people were happy buying tata moters on 1000₹ but nobody like to buy it on ₹600 now..

If you're new to all this, I'd highly recommend the Zerodha Varsity app to understand market basics—it’s free and beginner-friendly.

Also, consider starting with index mutual funds or ETFs if you’re not ready to pick individual stocks yet. Way less stress, and you still get market exposure. (Example- Icici next50 ETF)

And yeah—don’t forget about charges and taxes. Every trade has brokerage, STT, and capital gains tax (15% short-term, 10% long-term over ₹1L).

There’s a lot more to learn, but start slow, stay consistent, and don’t invest based on hype. 🙌",2025-06-03 08:42:37,2.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1l2413w/newbie_here/,StockMarketIndia

If I made a lumpsum investment in NIFTY 50 mutual fund on 1994 then I have received ""fractions of each shares "" present in Nifty 50 at 1994.

Now when i sell the same in 2024, 75% of the 1994 stocks have already lost the shine. So i would be getting good profit from ""fractions of stocks"" like Unilever/SBI/Reliance who have survived this 20 year ride.  , so ultimately i would be receiving very less profit when i redeem in 2024 as valuations of All other stocks has reduced too much

post,1kn5n8w,What is driving the growth of IT stocks in India?,Ok-Mountain-9541,"The rise in IT stocks in India is led by growing global demand for digital transformation, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity services. Indian IT firms are landing big overseas contracts, particularly from the US and Europe, which is driving their investor confidence. The industry also enjoys a talented workforce, cost-effectiveness, and rapid adoption of remote work and automation. Moreover, stable revenues, solid balance sheets, and positive quarterly earnings have rendered IT stocks appealing to domestic as well as foreign investors, making them a good option for long-term portfolio growth in a technology-led world.

post,1in0vov,"Growth in my trading journey, happy to go slow and steady :)",Adventurous-Gap8307,"Finally made my first 5 digit profit, been trading small quantities for over 1.5 years alongside my freelancing job

Not a new trader, been trading for over 2 years now but was trading with 50k-1L capital and used to withdraw my profits from time to time. Always traded options for swings(max total value never more than 8-10k) and max 2 good swing setups a week. Everything else intraday, risk no more than 700-800 rs per trade and target 1:2/1:3. Intraday I mostly trade as per the trending sectors, and then selecting the stocks which have moved less compared to the other stocks and enter those.

Capital used for today’s trades is approx 1.2L, was planning not to deploy more than 1L but market was trending so deployed slightly more.

Have been reading a lot of posts here everyday which describe how it’s almost impossible to make money trading. Just want to let everybody know, that it’s not impossible, but the learning curve is VERY steep. And by the time most people reach the end of this curve, they’ve blown up multiple accounts, and also end up destroying the other MOST important thing, which is their mindset.

So please remember, always start small. Take more swings and wait patiently for your setups to form. Risk very little in intraday as market doesn’t trend everyday, atleast not all the sectors. Some will trend daily but you need to get the flow right, which again takes a lot of time. Risking and making less intraday is crucial, which lets you ride your swings fully. 5-6 days like today and I can make a 6 figure income, which I’d say at my level is extremely good

And also, having a source of income alongside trading gives you a peace of mind. Not forcing you to take the substandard setups/trades. 

If you be disciplined, less greedy and fully focused on what you do, the money eventually comes. Stop focusing on daily/weekly results and be fully in sync with the process. There is indeed light at the end of this tunnel, provided you don’t stray from the correct path :) ",2025-02-11 15:16:25,3.0,9.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1in0vov/growth_in_my_trading_journey_happy_to_go_slow_and/,StockMarketIndia

I won't can't give full details but essentially the points are these:
1. Zaggle has over aggressive revenue recognition policies and also seems to be capitalising costs. 
2. The nature of business of Zaggle is confusing. Is it a SaaS business or merely a middleman that sells prepaid cards and profits from its transactions?
3. Esop policies prior to the IPO doesn't inspire confidence.

post,1k16d49,Wipro posts strong Q4 — stock still tanks 5%. Why?,Mr_Vilebur,"
The results looked solid on paper. But the stock? Straight red — down over 5%, short buildup, heavy volume.

Is this a case of “priced in already”? Or are the markets reacting to something hidden between the lines?

3. Large deal TCV (Total Contract Value) was at $1 billion, up 6% year-on-year by value and up by three deals by count.
4. The overall demand environment in the Americas is strong, with bookings in the $1 million to $4 million and $5 million to $10 million ranges.

post,1jqdyek,Indian IT stocks CRASH! Here's all you need to know!,The_Market_Maven,"The Nifty IT index dropped 4.05%, with Infosys, TCS, and HCL Tech leading the fall after Trump imposed a 26% tariff on Indian imports.

But the bigger worry? Over 50% of Indian IT revenue comes from the US. If the US economy slows, companies may cut Tech budgets, hurting Indian IT firms.

Add AI automation and inflation fears, the road ahead looks uncertain.

Here's a quick breakdown:

* Trump's new tariffs are raising concerns about trade barriers and cost pressures.
* Higher U.S. inflation risks leading to tighter corporate budgets and reduced Tech spending.
* The drop in U.S. Tech stocks is impacting sentiment and demand for Indian IT services.
* The weakening dollar is affecting revenue from U.S. clients.
* AI & automation risks reducing reliance on traditional outsourcing.",2025-04-03 09:29:17,15.0,15.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1jqdyek/indian_it_stocks_crash_heres_all_you_need_to_know/,IndianStreetBets

Today things totally changed, companies are fully blown when coming to IPO, they are fully valued. Thanks to VCs. So you can't make such gains. But its possible that many stocks will erode money.

Mutual funds are best to invest, not stocks. If you think you are more intelligent than worlds top minds - the fund managers then you can invest.

Now sectorial mutual fund also exist. Nifty only fallen 10%-15% why people crying because they think they are more intelligent than top stock market analyst and invested in stock. In india, any stock can disappear anytime. Ask people invested in satyam, Unitech. That were part of Nifty. One scam and it disappeared. Thousands of such companies are de listed on stock market.
