post,1icntjv,"Maruti Suzuki waiting for a big Move? - 2X sales , strong governamce and...",cashclue,"Heyy everyone ,

I've been researching Maruti Suzuki and wanted to share some insights while also getting the community's thoughts.
1. Sales & Revenue Growth – Maruti's sales have doubled in the last three years, which is impressive considering market conditions. Revenue has followed suit, reflecting strong demand.


2. CapEx & Profitability – The company has been making steady capital investments, and profitability remains strong. Would love to hear thoughts on whether the current CapEx trend supports long-term growth.


3. Corporate Governance – I went through the Board of Directors and found no red flags. The leadership team looks solid, which is a big plus for long-term investors.



Next Steps in My Research:

I'm now looking into remuneration structures—executive pay, incentives, and how they align with shareholder value. If anyone has insights on this for Maruti Suzuki (or auto stocks in general), I'd love to hear them!

What do you all think about Maruti’s trajectory? Does the sales growth make it a long-term buy, or are there risks I'm overlooking? Let’s discuss!

post,1gg7doa,Query regarding the latest Maruti results wrt paid up capital and diluted earnings,esteppan89,"Maruti results look normal and as expected, but then there is an issue with extra taxes that have been paid. The notes state that the taxes are for issuing new shares. Now if the company issued new shares and a sizable chunk at that there is no change in the paid up capital of the company nor in the diluted earnings. Going further back, i can see that an increase in paid up shares occurred in the audited results of the last financial year, with the increase of the same quantity as the number mentioned in this quarter results. If the issue took place before the last financial year, should'nt the taxes be accounted for in the last year ? How is it that it is paid only this quarter ?

Any pointers on pricing this issue in will be helpful.",2024-10-31 05:29:43,3.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gg7doa/query_regarding_the_latest_maruti_results_wrt/,IndianStockMarket

post,1f7u93u,Maruti's aggressive dealership expansion is catching attention! Could this be a strong indicator of robust growth potential? ,saveitwisely1,"Maruti Suzuki Expands Reach with New Arena Satellite Showrooms!

Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL) is set to launch Arena Satellite showrooms to tap into smaller towns and new markets, signaling a strategic push into rural areas and Tier-II/III cities.

These showrooms will be smaller than traditional Arena outlets, tailored to cater to localized demand and rural growth.

>Nexa Studio showrooms are also in the pipeline, targeting premium customers in smaller cities with a more compact format, complete with service workshops and spare parts areas.

>March 31 next year, 100 Nexa Studio dealerships will be operational, extending the premium Nexa experience to cities like Kolar, Gohana, Hathras, and Paonta Sahib.

MSIL has been in an expansion mode with its dealership presence and added 119 Nexa outlets between April 1 and August 23 this year, taking its overall Nexa count to 500.

**Investment Insight:**  Maruti’s aggressive dealership expansion could signal robust growth potential. Are you ready to invest in India's automotive leader?

post,1g76l6w,Hyundai Alloted 250 lots worth 34.3 Lac ₹,Daze_taken,"https://preview.redd.it/te9jrnwy1pvd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8587bfc957898139dc2d80dcadb95520847e201b

Read my Take first before any negetive comments :

# Hyundai Motor IPO

# Final Decision & Review⏬

May apply for Long term & Listing gain would be in range of 10% or lesser I feel so safe investors may stay away if any bad situation arise on listing day

▶️Hyundai is 2nd largest car mfg in india with 14% market share

Company is well established in India & it's well known brand in India as well World wide

Hyundai have 1,377 sales outlets & 1,561 service outlets across India

▶️Hyundai's Portfolio :

Sedans: Aura, Verna

Hatchbacks: Grand i10 NIOS, i20, i20 N Line

SUVs: Exter, Venue, Venue N Line, Creta, Creta N Line,Alcazar, Tucson, IONIQ 5

▶️Hyundai India serves Domastic as well as international markets like Africa , Nepal ,Latin America etc

▶️Revenue mix

Domestic : 76%

Exports : 24%

▶️ Strong Positives :



Excellent Anchor book & Huge demand from World's Fund Houses

2. HMI is Well Established in India since 1996

3. Strong parentage of Hyundai Group,Korea

4. Hyundai cars are more Premium & Sturdy than Maruti's so it has unique & better customer base

Plus with growing income per head , citizens will prefer more premium cars

Negetives :



Hyundai Group Took out huge ₹ 15,435 Cr cash as dividend

2. Revenue growth \~5%

3. Valuation inline with peer not cheaper

'Overall company looks Excellent'

It's Highly Profitable & Deep rooted brand in India

It's Better than loss making auto companies Like Ola , Aether etc

Plus they are launching EV version of the Bestselling car ""Creta"" soon so sales could drive up so Good company for Long Term , Short term will be decided based on fund house's demand...

Note : I applied more than this quantities in mankind IPO where everyone was negetive but I sold with 30% profit in few weeks after listing

Same goes with Vodafone FPO , first cry IPOs

Such Good Quality company's subscribed IPOs only give good opportunity to Earn significant gain in short to long term.

I have capacity to bear losses too and as I earned Good in such IPOs and my investment style is different and risky , no one should follow me and take their investments decesion wisely.

People are buying Simens , ABB ,Trent at 100+ PE while Hyundai coming at only 26.5 PE

Don't be too negetive on quality companies.

Someone say bad words and you expect me to shut up and suffer?

Why you both mod didn't deleted or removed that post yet?
and why such people are in group who starts abusing for no reason?

This is totally wrong and unfair , if I didn't answer those insects , then they would abuse again to me or other so I just replied and defended myself in their own ""language"".


Update on listing day :

To those haters and ill wishers of mine you should keep hating idiots 

I realised that here 70% of creatures have not even have 1 IQ 
Those Can't even understand my post and strategy ,

Already written I can bear loss and my vision is 1-2 years
It would be 2100 ₹ plus in some time but yaha idiots aa hi jate he comment karne and downvote karne.
Pata nhi kaha kaha muh mar ke comments kar rahe he gandve😂


Idhar tumhare pappa ne mankind , Vodafone , first cry  jese kai under subscribed IPO se hi ~40 lakh bana liye he to aaj ke loss se muje 1% bhi fark nhi padta , I am holding everything and have capacity to hold for years.

And other IPOs and stocks investment ka return isse jyada he jo count nhi kiya because vo under subscribed nhi the



2 brokerage gave coverage on Hyundai motors ,
Nomura gave target of ₹2,472
&
Macquarie gave ₹2235 target

Posted the same on my Twitter today:

https://twitter.com/EngineerStockks/status/1848583420521418857?t=BuT-no9NOgXEy6Z4mAJwqQ&s=19





Update on 2nd day of listing :


Hyundai Motor 5% Up🔥

Even though market cap is very huge 1,50,000 Cr
Heavy buying from fund houses

If invested 2 lac yesterday you could made 10,000 ₹ easily 

Yesterday was just panic and it was opportunity to buy on dips.

Where are those morons and idiots now😂

While few here gave me sympathy and good wishes and that's good but

All those wishing for my losses should just d#e , 
World doesn't't want such hatres and Morons!



""I'm just 2.5% away to recover Fully from loss!""

2100 ₹ coming soon!

post,1igj3pu,"STOCK MARKET CRASH AFTER BUDGET 2025 IS THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO RETAIL INVESTORS – CRY MORE, PAPER HANDS!""",masterbaras,"Let the tears flow from the ""experts"" and institutional clowns 🤡 who are panic-selling today. While Sensex tanked \~750 points and Nifty kissed 23,226. The REAL INVESTORS are rubbing their hands like Thanos snapping half the universe. Here’s why these ""crashes"" are a BLESSING:

1.FOREIGNERS DUMPING SHARES? THANK THEM FOR THE DISCOUNT!

FIIs sold ₹1,327 CRORE worth of stocks post-Budget. Good riddance! These guys have been net sellers since October 2024, and now they’re handing us CHEAP BLUE-CHIPS on a silver platter. Tata Steel, L&T, NTPC – all down 3-4%? I’ll take your entire stock!

2. TRUMP’S TARIFF TANTRUM = BLACK FRIDAY SALE

25% tariffs on Mexico/Canada and 10% on China? Global markets panicking? WHO CARES. This isn’t 2018. The Modi govt’s tax cuts (₹12.75L income = ZERO TAX) will unleash a CONSUMPTION BOOM for FMCG, autos, and durables. Maruti, ITC, Dabur at discounts? Load. The. Boat.

3. MID/SMALLCAP BLOODBATH? PERFECT TIME TO BUY FUTURE MULTIBAGGERS

BSE Midcap/Smallcap down 1-8%? Bharat Dynamics, JP Power, IREDA getting slaughtered? Yes, please! Retail investors with DIAMOND HANDS know corrections are where fortunes are made. Remember 2020? Exactly.

4. ""BUT WHAT ABOUT RBI POLICY UNCERTAINTY!"" – STFU AND BUY

The rupee’s at 87/USD, and RBI might cut rates? EVEN BETTER. Cheaper loans = more spending = auto, real estate, and consumer stocks 📈. Weak hands are selling because they can’t handle volatility. We feast on their fear.

5. GOVT’S ""LACK OF CAPEX"" IS A SMOKESCREEN

Sure, railway/defense/infra stocks dipped, but the Budget’s ₹500Cr AI fund and MSME credit boost are LONG-TERM WINNERS. Paperhands crying about ""no capex"" don’t understand strategic plays.

CONCLUSION: This ""crash"" is a FIRE SALE for those with vision. The FII exodus and Trump’s meltdown are clearing the path for retail investors to DOMINATE. Stay greedy, buy the dip, and let the panic-sellers fund your retirement.

post,1gbu0xz,The real reason behind the fall,JustDrop007,"Companies growing at 5% should not be valued at a 30 price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. Companies growing at 10% should not be valued at a 50 PE ratio. Companies that grow by 15-20% should not be expected to provide 100% returns.

post,1e1bl3b,Never sell you winners.,lotus_eater_rat,"I moved to Pune in 2018 and lived near the Persistent System office. I used to pass through their building, and It may sound funny but one of the reasons to check the company was because I liked their office names. I started investing in the PPFAS mutual fund and the persistent system was one of the top holdings. I bought shares worth 45K in 2018. Sold 1/3rd in 2021 and again in 2022 to get advantage of 1 lakh LTCG tax-expectation. Also bought TATA elixir during the same period and sold it when it became 2X.

I did make some money but after seeing the further growth I promised myself that I would never sell  
unless there is something seriously wrong with the companies I am holding. Have not sold a single stock since March 2022, Remaining 15k of the persistent system is now 2.60 lakhs (17X) in 6 years. I have HDFC Bank, ITC, Persistent System, Arman Finance, Maruti, Titan, ICICI Bank, TCS, and NMDC in my portfolio.

I know my XIRR (22%) may not be impressive in today’s scenario but I would suggest don’t sell your  
winner for a small gain. If you are holding good companies, there is potential it could be 25X or 50X in the long term. Also, think what difference it will make to your wealth if u even make 5k in 6 months on a 10k investment. It will surely make a difference if u make 2.5 lakh from 10k.

post,1idj3aa,Tata Motors Analysis.,SuperbPercentage8050,"Reposting my 2-months old research.

Most of the investors buy in impulsive mode based on story telling by media and influencers without looking into the financial language and fundamentals of stock.

You all will be seduced by PE of 6 but global giants like toyota, VM, Hyundai and all german automakers  are also trading in 4-7 pe range.

So it’s not a value buy, but a value trap.

The Analysis(Posted on SubReddit: IndiaGrowthstocks)

Pricing Power- High-quality businesses must have the ability to pass on costs to customers without losing market share.

**TataMotors has Moderate pricing power**. JLR provides some strength, but the PV and CV segments dilute overall pricing ability. 

Pricing Structure **- Passenger Vehicles (PV):** Limited pricing power in the mass-market segment because competition is intense. Tata's EVs ( Nexon EV) have some pricing power due to a **dominant market share in India (58%- nov 2024 data**), but **i**s **loosing market share to new entrants** like MG, BYD, and Hyundai.( **Its ev share has dropped from 74% to 58%-FADA REPORT)**

**JLR (Luxury Vehicles):** **Better pricing power due to strong branding,** especially for models like Range Rover and Defender. However, luxury demand is cyclical and tied to economic conditions.(Top 3 Market are North America, Europe and china and **it will face strong competition from brands like BYD and Tesla** which **have both technological and manufacturing edge.** 

Margins-  Focus on high-margin businesses that reflect strong moats and operational efficiency.

Tata Motors **Margins are low and cyclical but have been improving due to better operational efficiency and product mix.**

**EBITDA Margins cyclical,** past 5 years it has ranged from 2% to 14% and has not remained consistent.JLR contributes higher margins (\~15-17%) but is volatile. PV and CV segments operate on thin margins (\~5-8%), heavily influenced by input costs and competition.

Capital Intensity- Asset-light businesses are favoured as they require less reinvestment and scale more efficiently. Tata Motors **Capital intensity is high, which reduces free cash flow scalability.**

**Automobiles are inherently capital-intensive**..Tata Motors invests heavily in R&D (\~6-7% of revenue) and manufacturing facilities, especially for EVs.**The EV business requires significant upfront capital for battery manufacturing, charging infrastructure, and product development.**

Free Cash Flow (FCF)- High and consistent FCF generation is critical for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Tata Motors FCF is improving but inconsistent because of the cyclical nature and high reinvestment needs.**Positive FCF generation was supported by better operating cash flow from JLR in the past few yearsand this led to the spike in stock price**,  **but recently JLR has cut the FCF guidance by 30% due to high capex. High CapEx and working capital needs constrain FCF growth**, particularly in the EV segment for Tata motors.

ROCE- A high and stable ROCE reflects efficient capital allocation and business strength.

Tata Motors ROCE - **Improving but is not consistent when you look at 10 years history due to the cyclical nature and it improves in the upwards cycle and goes negative or very low in down cycle of Auto industry, but still low compared to high-quality, asset-light companies.**

ROCE improved to \~11.5% in FY23, but remains below high quality preferred threshold (>15-20%).**Recently they have increased the price which might improve ROCE but they can loose more market share due to price increase** because their is **no major switching cost involved when you purchase a vehicle.(Analyse your own car purchase history and what factors led to that decisions)**

Cyclicality- Businesses should demonstrate stable demand and earnings across economic cycles.

Tata Motors Breakdown: Cyclicality in CV and JLR segments makes it a less predictable investment.**JLR sales are highly discretionary, tied to macroeconomic trends**  and consumer sentiment in luxury markets. **This is the official data from JLR website** and the financial performance says it all.

JLR SALES 7 OCT UPDATE

**Retail sales** in Q2 FY25 were 103,108 units, **down 3% vs Q2 FY24**

**Production in Q2 FY25 was restricted** to c.86,000 units, down 7% compared to c.93,000 units in Q2 FY24, as a result of aluminium supply disruptions reported in Q1 FY25

**Wholesales in Q2 FY25 were 87,303 units, down 10% vs Q2 FY24**

**China is facing a macro crisis and its impacting JLR Numbers** ( **down 22% in Europe, down 17% in China and down 6% Overseas -** JLR Official website data ) and the impact was compensated growth of  29% in the UK, 9% in North America)

**The CV segment is heavily cyclical,** driven by infrastructure spending and economic cycles\*\*.EV adoption is slow in the country due to various factors like charging, consumer trust and range anxiety.\*\* 

Strong Moats- Durable competitive advantages are essential, including branding, network effects, and technolog**y.-**

Tata Motors has a  **Moderate moat, but sustainability is uncertain,** especially in the face of global EV competition.**EV Moat is eroding as it lost market share of nearly 25% in past 2 years even after** having a first mover advantage. Automobile sectors mostly have a weak moat and is documented in various investing works because of the high competition, low to no switching cost for consumers, price wars.

**The strength for its moat comes from its brand power, Economies of scale and Supply Chain,Vertical Integration.** Tata's group synergies ( Tata Power for EV chargers, Tata Chemicals for battery solutions)

**Issue is that there are so many players which have these factors and in international markets it lack the technological edge and that market is a major source of revenue. MOST OF  THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS HAVE SCALE AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES AND THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR SAME CONSUMERS.** 

A strong **moat is one which has** an **ecosystem created around it like apple ecosystem, or technological edge like** TSMC with patents or operate in a duopoly/monopoly and have very high switching cost. Automobile sector lacks that strong moat feature. or even a moderate moat.  

Reinvestment Opportunities-  Businesses should have organic growth opportunities that require minimal incremental capital\*\*.\*\* Tata motors has high reinvestment needs with uncertain long-term returns because no one knows who will win the ev race and how long it will take for that transition to happen. So how much ROCE with be created on that ev investment and how much fcf it will generate is uncertain. 

**Significant reinvestment is needed for EV technology and global expansion, especially for battery supply chains and premium models.Growth is capital-intensive and dependent on external factors like subsidies and infrastructure development.**

Leverage and Balance Sheet- A strong balance sheet with low leverage supports resilience during downturns.

Tata Motors current Debt and Financial profile-   **Net automotive debt stood at ₹22,00 crore, up 18% from the ₹18,600 crore net debt** **in** June **2024,  JLR's net debt also climbed up to ₹13,500 crore, from the ₹10,500 crore posted at the end of the September quarter.**

The India business **which turned net cash at the end of FY24 has now reported a net debt position** of around ₹700 crore.

So the financials are deteriorating and debt levels are increasing because of the factors I have mentioned above. 

\*\*10. Founder-\*\*Driven Leadership-Founder-driven companies often exhibit bold, long-term vision and superior capital allocation.

Tata Motors is part of the Tata Group, with leadership focused on professional management. **While it is not founder-driven, it benefits from Tata Group synergies and a long-term vision.**

Economies of Scale -\*\*Strengthens the Moat and Market Share and Improves Margin.

Tata Motors benefits from economies of scale due to its large domestic and global market presence.**The ability to spread R&D and fixed costs across a high volume of sales, especially in the commercial vehicle segment, helps improve margins. It has advantages of economies of scale but cannot convert it into high margins** **and strengthening of moat because of the sector it operates it which attracts intense price wars and heavy capital investments.** Economies of scale model have beneficial impact in asset light model where the reduced input cost is either passed on to consumer to gain more market share and customer loyalty or increase the net operating margins. 

Consistent EPS Growth Performance: EPS has been inconsistent due to cyclical downturns, JLR’s performance issues, and the capital-intensive nature of the business. Recent development indicate a negative trajectory as already mentioned above and reflected in financials. 

Reasonable PE- Tata Motors **trades at a discount to peers like Maruti Suzuki** (domestic PV) and global luxury carmakers, reflecting historical volatility and JLR-related concerns. **Tata Motors is reasonably valued at 8 time earnings, with upside potential in PE expansion if JLR** stabilises **and EV momentum continues.The risk here is that sales are declining as mentioned above and auto sectors is already going through a downturn and competition is increasing from global players. So even if PE expands but eps** doesn't **grow the stock price**remains **stable and** doesn't **grow.** 

Promoters’ Skin in the Game- **Tata Group has a strong stake in the company**, ensuring alignment with long-term strategic goals. **Stakes have been reduced from 46.3% to 42.58% in 2024. They have  skin in the game but high quality companies have a trait of buying back stocks and increasing holding. The reduction is not substantial but must be tracked in next few quarters** 

**I've  provided a detailed analysis on Tata Motors and the auto sector and have merged few checklist points to explain it better . If possible, avoid these sectors, as they don't offer massive compounding. Those who got it during covid at dirt cheap prices think that its a compounding machine but the reality is that it was trading around 550rs in 2016 when it was in upwards cycle  and after 8 years those long term investors have just made 250rs which is less than 50% for 8 years and a CAGR of less than 5%.**

Global markets research shows that  and most of the automobile companies have a CAGR history of less than 7% in long term. **So this sector is not a compounding machine and is usually avoided by all high quality great investors.**

**It scores LOW on the checklist parameters** and If any one still wants to invest in tata motors then wait for the auto sales to drop, and inventory to rise, invest during that crisis phase and wait for the fundamentals and sales to improve.

comment,1idj3aa,,,,,,,ma1ixmt,gregarious_i,"7 Key Takeaways for lazy readers:   

1. **Value Trap, Not Value Buy** – Low P/E (~6-8) is misleading; auto stocks are cyclical and capital-intensive.  

2. **EV Market Share Dropping** – Fell from 74% to 58%, losing ground to MG, BYD, and Hyundai despite first-mover advantage.  

3. **Inconsistent Margins & Cash Flow** – EBITDA (2%-14%) fluctuates, FCF is volatile, and JLR’s capex cuts FCF guidance by 30%.  

4. **Cyclical Sales & ROCE Struggles** – JLR sales fell (-22% Europe, -17% China, -6% Overseas); ROCE (~11.5%) remains weak.  

5. **High EV Reinvestment with Uncertainty** – Heavy R&D (6-7% of revenue) and capex, but no guaranteed returns amid global competition.  

6. **Debt Levels Increasing** – Net debt up 18% (₹22,000 Cr), JLR debt rising, and India business back to net debt (~₹700 Cr).

post,1g57qjg,Hyundai IPO: The other side,NotAmbani,"Hello Everyone. I’ve been seeing a lot of chatter here about why you shouldn’t jump on the Hyundai India IPO, and while some points are valid, I want to share another side of the story. Not saying you should or shouldn't invest—**just clearing up some misconceptions and dropping some data to show you the other-side.**

**This IPO is not without problems I'm sure you must have seen problems on this sub already. THIS POST WILL LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE.**

# Hyundai India's PE Ratio Vs Hyundai Korea's PE Ratio

One common gripe is Hyundai India’s PE ratio is around 25 versus Hyundai Korea’s \~5. Yeah, that's true, but it misses the bigger picture. Check out these other companies:

|Indian Company|Indian Company's PE|Foreign Company|Foreign Company's PE|Ratio between PEs|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India Ltd|73|Nestle SA|19|3.84|
|Hindustan Unilever Ltd|63|Unilever PLC|22|2.86|
|Maruti Suzuki India Ltd|29|Suzuki Motor Corp|9.5|2.7|
|BASF India|54.5|BASF SE|12.5|4.36|
|GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited|70|GSK plc|15|4.66|

Notice a trend? Indian subsidiaries usually trade at a premium. It’s because India’s seen as a high-growth market, and the free float (how many shares are available for trading) is typically lower, pushing up the PE.

We can do the same comparing Revenue to Market cap also.

|Indian Company|Revenue (Billion USD)|Market Cap (Billion USD)|Foreign Company|Revenue (Billion USD)|Market Cap (Billion USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India Ltd|2.32|28.27|Nestle SA|111.03|250.50|
|Hindustan Unilever Ltd|7.35|77.84|Unilever plc|58.20|157.06|
|Maruti Suzuki India Ltd|16.56|46.38|Suzuki Motor Corp|36.60|19.87|
|BASF India|1.72|4.28|BASF SE|70.43|44.73|
|GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited|0.4|5.4|GSK plc|39.46|79.54|
|Hyundai India|8.3|19|Hyundai Motor Co|125.35|44.86|

This data honestly surprised me too. Suzuki Motor Corp holds 58% of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. This suggests that the rest of Suzuki Motor Corp is actually negatively valued. And yes the Revenue being more than the market cap for some companies is not a mistake. This just goes to show the discrepancy between the foreign and Indian share markets.

My point here is that the Indian company will **ALWAYS** seem overvalued compared to their foreign parents. Even if you were to dig deeper like I did with the Suzuki Example, you will realise that the market cap for the foreign company seems to be disproportionately coming from the Indian company which would be listed as an Asset on their books.

# Comparing PE/Valuation with Competition

|Company|Market Cap (Cr INR)|Revenue (Cr INR)|PE Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Maruti Suzuki|3,91,000|1,46,000|29.01|
|Mahindra and Mahindra|3,78,000|1,42,000|33.56|
|Tata Motors|3,37,000|4,44,000|10.75|
|Hyundai India|1,59,258|71,302|**\~26.5**|

So, the PE ratios for Hyundai India is actually less than Maruti and Mahindra. It's market cap to revenue ratio is also lower than Maruti and Mahindra. Tata motors is the exception here since they do operate in more sectors.

Now I know that you should not judge stocks solely based on PEs, but this provides a quick overview as to where Hyundai India stands. You and dig deep through their books and you will find that everything seems to be inline with their peers.

Even their Market Cap to Revenue is inline with Maruti and Mahindra.

# Index Inclusion: Why It Matters

Hyundai India is set to be included in major stock indexes (Nifty 100, Nifty 500, Possibly Nifty Next 50) within the next 6 months. Once it’s in the indexes, lots of passive funds will automatically buy it, increasing demand and potentially driving up the price.

At IPO, Hyundai India’s market cap will be similar to big players like Punjab National Bank or Adani Energy Solutions. Even 2-3% of shares going to index funds can mean around 10% of total free float shares getting snapped up. The actively managed funds will also want to buy Hyundai India since it’s now part of their benchmark Index, boosting demand even more.

# The Offer for Sale (OFS)

I have to say that the OFS offering has lead to some South Korean hate on this sub. This is insane and should not be happening. Hyundai came into India, set up a subsidiary, manufacturing and genuine created value. And even if their actions are ""Greedy"", that is just one company. It's insane to see this hate being directed at South Korea as a whole.

So what's exactly happening: Hyundai Korea is selling shares, not Hyundai India. They **claim** to need funds for R&D which happens at the Parent company while Hyundai India is only for Manufacturing. This IPO lets them get cash without Hyundai having to take on debt or dilute its equity.

**Hyundai Korea still holds a majority after the IPO, so they’re not just exiting.** They’re still invested and running the show, ensuring that the company has the backing it needs for future growth. They very much still have skin in the game. OFS is actually not that uncommon when you look at it. The Indian company's financials are healthy and it simply doesn't need a cash injection at this point.

# The Dividend

Pre-IPO dividends can sound sketchy, but they’re actually pretty common. Look at Indigo—they did the same thing. Hyundai India is using its generated cash to pay dividends, which should be factored into your valuation calculations. This can actually boost ROE by reducing excess equity, making the company look more efficient.

NB: Came across this research which explains in more detail why Pre-IPO dividend is not as bad as you think [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927538X23002664](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927538X23002664)

# The IPO will be undersubscribed

Well- Data suggests otherwise. The IPO is already over 40% subscribed. As of writing this post, DIIs (Domestic Mutual Funds and AMCs) have still NOT placed their Bids (They usually come in on the last day). The IPO has similar subscription to Paytm (and other IPOs this size) after 2 days. Given the trends in past IPO subscriptions, it is fair to assume this IPO will be full subscribed and may be oversubscribed by up to 2x.

Even if it doesn't hit 3-4x oversubscription, filling up the subscription is still a win, especially since Hyundai is raising a massive $3.3 billion USD.

(NB: If you want to check this data for yourself, head over to: [https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/issue-information?symbol=HYUNDAI&series=EQ&type=Active](https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/issue-information?symbol=HYUNDAI&series=EQ&type=Active) then click Bid details and select ""Consolidated Bids"". Make sure you are not only looking at the NSE Bids.)

# Grey Market Premium (GMP)

Even though GMP has dropped, it never went below zero. It has always stayed a premium and never became a discount. This shows steady interest and suggests the IPO is priced fairly—not overpriced or underpriced.

Unlike many IPOs that rely on discounts to attract buyers, Hyundai’s valuation means the listing price should align closely with the offer price, reflecting true value. If you only apply to IPOs for listing gains- This isn't an IPO for you.

# A side note

One of the biggest issues with the Indian stock market is that the Breath of the market is not increasing as fast as the Depth. More and more capital is pouring in but the number of large companies isn't increasing at the same speed. Given the IPOs that have been coming out at such a huge discount recently all giving amazing listing gains, I could imagine why this is a turn off that Hyundai decided to list themselves at fair market value. But IPOs aren't meant for a listing gain. They are to take a company public, which this one seems to be successful in doing.

# --- Edit ---

**Appreciate all the feedback. Someone even texted me and called me Mr. Hyundai Man which I found hilarious. A few common points I missed seem to be brought up by multiple people, so I wanted to address these.**

# The Royalty

So, yes. There is a Royalty.

But guess what? Every foreign company with an Indian subsidiary does this. Why? Are they trying to loot India? No. This is the payment for maintaining the brand. Any spend Hyundai Korea does to polish the Hyundai brand benefits Hyundai India and this is the payment for that. The royalty is capped at 5%. This isn't anything insane and many other MNCs - including Toyota India (which is currently private), Bosch, Schaeffler India and Wabco India - pay royalty payments to their parent companies. A couple interesting ones are:

|Company|Cap on Royalty to Parent for Brand|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India|4.5%|They tried to increase it recently but the shareholders rejected the resolution.|
|Maruti Suzuki|5%||

Now, the Cap doesn't always mean this much money will be payed out. In FY23, Maruti paid 3.75% royalty to Suzuki motors. At one point in time, the royalty used to be above 6-6.5% before coming down to the 5% cap now in place. So, I ask you this-

**If Maruti Suzuki has a 5% royalty, why is Hyundai India's 5% not justified? I would argue that ""Maruti"" has a brand value within India which may be sustainable without Suzuki. Hyundai is Hyundai and without the name, it has no alternative.**

Hyundai India benefits much more from this royalty deal than Maruti Suzuki does. Yet for some reason, people think Hyundai is ""Greedy"" and Suzuki are Saints.

# Mini IPO? 75% promoter shareholding rule

Someone in the comments said ""the parent company has to offload an additional 7.5% stake in the coming six months to reach the max 75% promoter holding"". This is partly true that 7.5% additional stake needs to be offloaded but not in the next 6 months. This will take place in 3-5 years ([Source](https://www.autocarpro.in/news/hyundai-india-to-dilute-75-additional-stake-in-3-5-years-122999)). This would be 1-2% additional free float every year something the markets can easily handle while increasing liquidity for the stock (speculation alert) potentially propelling Hyundai India into the F&O Category.

It is in **Hyundai's best interest to do this as slowly as possible too**. If they were to crash the price of the Indian subsidiary, Hyundai Korea's books would show fewer assets. To keep their own book inflated, they will make sure this happens responsibly. **They aren't selling and running away, they will still own 75% of the company.**

# So you are actually saying Hyundai India is a Buy?

Absolutely NOT. The purpose of this post is not to tell you to buy or not. It was to show the facts. The decision to BUY is yours. People seemed to have reached the conclusion that Hyundai is Bad with incomplete facts.

It is funny how people have a problem with things from Royalty to Valuation. Funny part is, from the looks of it, Hyundai India tried to copy Maruti Suzuki. And this makes sense! They are following a very similar business model here. In fact, Suzuki Motors is much worse of without Maruti Suzuki compared to Hyundai Korea without Hyundai India.

However on a serious note, think that Tata Shares might not reach their peak. Reasons:

a. Slow growth of EV market
b. Maruti entering EV market 
c. Maruti cars getting 5 Star Safety rating 
d. Global JLR slowdown 

Point d. Might be cyclical, rest aren't.

However, the share might not test 300 levels. 500 is the sweet spot.

post,1g5lzu2,Hyundai IPO last-minute TLDR,Lazy-Transition8236,"Keeping this short since people don't read entirely and comment according to what they choose to read.

The GMP is now around 1% of the IPO band price, so you would have an idea of what to do in this IPO.

Now coming to the long-term perspective instead of IPO:

1. Good market share and largest exporter of passenger cars from India.

2. Potential to benefit from growing car ownership in India

3. Car sales down in the short-term and if profitability is managed well, Hyundai Motors can grow well in the long-term.

4. Increasing net-profits and revenue.

5. Royalty to parent company up from 2% to 3.5%. Comparing Hyundai to Maruti Suzuki in this aspect is not a good idea since Maruti can de-merge from their parent company and still do well.

Not talking about other red flags since people are defending Hyundai for some reason.

Reasons to wait until listing and to NOT apply for IPO:

1. GMP down really bad and the listing will happen at a discounted price.

2. Even if the listing happens at a good premium, by some miracle, the IPO size is huge and the selloff to book profits will be MASSIVE leading to the share price coming down and being volatile.

post,1ehhaj4,DD | NIFTY unlikely to crash in the near term,jacked_to-the_tits,"Listen up folks! 🚀🔥

With NIFTY hitting an all-time high of 25,000 and marking a \~15% YTD gain there’s been a lot of chatter about a potential crash. However, here’s why a significant crash might not be on the horizon:

# 1. Strong Q2 & Q3 Earnings Ahead:

Predictions for Q2 and Q3 earnings from Indian companies are optimistic:  
  
(a) **Telecom Sector:** Major players like Reliance JIO, Airtel, and Vodafone have increased their tariffs by 20%, which is likely to boost their earnings for the next 2-3 quarters.  
  
(b) **Auto Sector:** Historically, auto companies experience a weak Q1, but Q2 and Q3 typically see stronger performance. Expect improved results from Tata Motors, Maruti, TVS Motors, and M&M.  
  
(c) **IT Sector:** With the US Fed expected to cut rates from September, US companies will likely increase discretionary spending, benefiting Indian IT firms with higher demand for their services.  
  
(d) **FMCG Sector:** The new coalition government is focusing on rural development, which should boost revenues for FMCG companies.  
  
(e) **Infra and Capital Goods:** Infra and capital goods companies will get new projects (because that's how this govt markets itself - ""development"", ""viksit bharat"")  
  
(f) **Banks:** After lagging for six months, banks should also see better results as the RBI follows the US Fed’s lead in cutting rates.

All these factors suggest that the upcoming Q2 and Q3 will likely see strong earnings reports. Infact this is what the management of most of these companies have reported in their earnings calls - earnings to be better in Q2 and Q3. This should support further growth in NIFTY.

# 2. Favorable Global Factors:

As central banks all around the world are cutting rates - it means money will become cheaper and cheaper money means more investments! This liquidity is expected to flow into Indian equities. Additionally, Indian bonds are set to increase their weight in global indices from 1% to 10% over the next ten months, potentially bringing in $10 billion in inflows. While this bond news might already be priced into NIFTY, the overall trend is positive. Moreover, regardless of whether Trump or Kamala wins, US - China trade relations will remain elevated (may elevate even more if Trump wins) and this would benefit Indian manufacturing and exports.

# 3. Technical Analysis:

From a technical standpoint, NIFTY PE ratio, though slightly high, is not nearly overvalued. On the other hand a higher PE ratio often indicates investor confidence in future earnings and hence their willingness to pay a premium. Once these earnings materialize, the PE ratio will likely normalize.

Lets also take a look at this chart which shows that NIFTY has broken out from the middle of a channel when it crossed the 24000 level and isn’t facing extreme resistance at the 25,000 level. The chart, which seems to be in play for almost four years since COVID, suggests that there is room for further upward movement if better earnings are reported in the upcoming quarters. Thus, a significant correction seems unlikely; rather, we might see some sideways consolidation between 24,000 and 25,200 until Q2 earnings.

While there may be some profit-taking and short-term volatility, the combination of strong upcoming earnings, favorable global conditions, and supportive technical indicators makes a major crash in the near term seem unlikely. Instead, we might experience consolidation before potentially seeing further gains.

What do you all think? Am I missing any factors or do you agree with this outlook?

post,1g3mc80,What's up with Hyundai IPO negativity ,More_Performance_813,"Hyundai is having second largest market share and historically has been a major player in Indian automobile sector. Apart from Suzuki, only Hyundai is seriously invested in our domestic market specifically and has long term planning and strategy with frequent portfolio upgrades. It is even bringing Genesis Brand in India unlike other manufacturers which have a static strategy towards India. 

I can throw a lot of statistics regarding P/E and it's past and future performance. Hyundai along with sister brand KIA is rising globally as well competing with Ford, Toyota worldwide. 

So why are people crying about it being OFS and higher P/E. Mahindra has 31 P/E ratio which is higher than Maruti so do you think it is a shit stock? 

People are comparing it with Ola and Paytm, they are loss making company with doubtful corporate strategies. Everyone on this sub will cry after listing gains of Hyundai and rising value afterwards as well.

post,1j3dhcy,the sad reality of MSIL share and their profits how they treat their stakeholders and partners,Indiancarfanatic,"Hey everyone, I worked in the sales department of a car dealership, and if any fresher is looking to join a dealership, especially Maruti, I want to share my experience.

I worked in one of the dealerships for almost a year as a trainer. My key job roles were training people about cars, teaching them how to pitch a product, ensuring they performed well, and conducting interviews with new joinees in both sales and service. Since I had an automobile background, I got this job. The pay was okay for a fresher—₹15,000—while many others joined for as little as ₹8,000 or even less (below minimum wage ). which is illegal Even in service centers, we would hire people at the lowest possible salary, by asking personal questions like how many family members they had. Most of these employees came from economically unstable backgrounds, making them easy to manipulate and force into work without proper adherence to labor laws.

They never started my PF even after six months, nor did I receive ESI or health benefits. This was the case for almost all my colleagues across different dealerships. in this region there are 5-5 prominent dealerships  
i even being a civil engineer over saw the construction of 2 workshops for zero extra pay and the owners got a very cheap labor out of me who would do everything they told me to do  
i did almost everything they needed in a dealership and even more

# Salary Deductions & Unfair Work Conditions

If an employee was late—even by just 30 minutes—three times in a month, a whole day’s salary would be deducted, which is illegal. There was no pay for overtime either. but it was expected to stay till 8 pm

Due to a shortage of drivers, new sales guys were never treated with respect and were often expected to take customers on test drives themselves or wait till the seniors got the test drive . Test drives would sometimes result in successful deals, but other times, we’d return empty-handed, hand over the keys to security at 9 PM, and then take the bus home. i have driven evaluated and given service advice to so many customers ive lost count

During peak season, I personally delivered multiple cars to customers. I never took a single tip, but every time a customer offered ₹200 or so, I felt humiliated—like I had been reduced to that level.

# Unpaid Incentives & Pressure from Management

Every trainer had an incentive that varied between ₹35 to ₹70 per car, but I never saw a single penny of it.

assuming a dealerships sells around 100 cars which they easily would i have around 35000 thousand in incentives stuck here but the actual numbers are a lot higher  
then maruti contests which i won twice but they are just delaying the funds stating useless reason

If new employees didn’t make a sale, I was the one questioned—management constantly asked what I was teaching. The system is designed in such a way that we are held liable for everything, even things beyond our control.

We were also forced to sell many vehicles with changed panels and body parts, lying to customers on a daily basis. After a while, this kind of dishonesty eats away at you mentally.

I would accompany a new joining batch of 4-5 people every day, walking long distances to help them get test drives and land sales. Many times, I succeeded, but the backlash for missing targets was insane.

Safety was never a consideration. If a car had multiple test drives in a day, we had to drive like maniacs to finish the target and return the vehicle on time. Lunch breaks were non-existent, and if we weren’t out chasing leads, we were sitting in one place, making hundreds of calls, surrounded by mosquitoes—working conditions that aren’t even remotely humane.

# Maruti’s Role in All This

Compared to other brands, Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) succeeds because of how power-tripping pusshy and abusive their regional and national sales teams are. They have a target of 3,000–4,000 cars per region and make sure dealerships hit those numbers by scolding employees, instructing HR to withhold salaries, and interrogating staff as if they own them. But when it comes to fulfilling their own promises—like paying incentives worth thousands—they turn a deaf ear.

Maruti is fully aware of these exploitative practices, yet they allow them to continue because, at the end of the day, all they care about is sales. The same applies to other brands—every company operates with this mentality.

At Maruti, there are countless unnecessary tasks to complete every month. The iLearn app, which barely works, wastes salespeople’s time, as they are forced to answer questions they struggle with due to a lack of tech familiarity. Then there’s the car configurator, MS chatbox, and the endless SMS and emails customers keep getting.

On top of this, we had to roam the city all day, visiting shops, trying to get leads from banks, and meeting monthly enquiry targets. Many days, we wouldn’t even have a drop of water to drink or money to buy something refreshing. The exhaustion from walking, traveling on crowded buses and local trains, and dealing with rejection was brutal.

Then comes the worst part: incentives were never cleared.

* A good salesperson selling 3-4 cars a month was eligible for several incentives:
   * Spot Incentive (₹1,000–₹2,000 per car upon delivery)
   * Target Completion Incentives (₹3,000–₹4,000)
   * Accessories Incentive (₹500–₹1,000)
   * Loan Payout (1%, but another 1% was kept by the dealer)
   * Add-on Incentives (Extended Warranty, RSA, CCP)
   * Maruti Contest Incentives (extra payouts for top sales performers in each of Maruti’s 16 regions) around 5000 -10000 thousand

However, these incentives were rarely paid. The reason? If employees received their rightful earnings, they would leave for better opportunities. Keeping them unpaid trapped high-performing staff, forcing them to take a financial loss before quitting.  
we never had sick leaves it was all adjusted from working extra

# Ethical Issues in Sales

Sales staff were pressured to sell cars at any cost, even pushing customers into unaffordable loans. We saw many cases where a buyer couldn’t pay their EMIs, yet we had to get them a loan—usually taxi drivers. When they defaulted, bank representatives would interrogate us. But when we faced issues like software failures, withheld incentives, or unfair terminations, Maruti would claim, “We don’t interfere in dealer-employee matters.”

Yet, they had no problem instructing HR to hold our salaries, forcing us to attend useless meetings and training, and making us push terrible-value cars onto customers—cars that weren’t even available, like the S-Presso. We had to deal with customers’ anger and sometimes even threats because of this.

# Toxic Work Culture

Unlike Hyundai and Tata, where sales staff are treated with at least some respect (even if they work less), Maruti is full of backstabbers. Many times, we gave constructive criticism, only for the Maruti regional team to steal our ideas, claim them as their own, and receive awards for them—while we got nothing, not even the legal bare minimum.

There’s no real growth in this industry.

* You start as a salesperson.
* If you’re lucky, you become a team leader.
* Then maybe a manager.
* If fortune smiles on you, you become a business head, earning around ₹60,000 a month—by the time you’re 50.

# No Job Security & No Future

In the service department, it’s the same story.  
No company will hire you because you don’t have a proper offer letter or salary slip. Everything is paid in cash. Your experience holds no value. Very few people manage to escape dealerships and get jobs in proper companies or government roles where at least health insurance is provided.

Organizations like FADA, SIAM, and the parent companies don’t care one bit.

# Worker Exploitation & Health Hazards

Thousands of employees are forced to lie to customers, upsell products they can’t afford, and work without fair wages.

Service staff work in unsafe conditions, with no protective equipment. They breathe toxic fumes and handle carcinogens daily.

# The Sad Reality

comment,1hawp77,,,,,,,m1bxphh,SuperbPercentage8050,"I have given a framework and checklist on r/indiagrowthstocks and be it mid cap or small cap or large cap if any stocks goes through that filter you will end up with high quality stocks and investment. 

The LARGE CAP WONT GO A 100 BAGGER BECAUSE OF SIZE AT A MATURE OR LATE STAGE YOU GET A DECENT 12-15% IF YOU HOLD IT FOR LONG TIME AND THE SECTOR ITSELF HAS A RUNWAY. 

With small and madcap if they operate in sectors that have growth for long periods and they dominate in that sector then you get multi baggers. because the pe expands from 215-20 to 80 and eps grows at same pace. 

for example polycab was a 8-10x because of the secular runway of fiberisation of whole India and pe was 20 so a reasonable valuation. pe expanded a3 times and eps also expanded 3-4 times  so we had a 10x return. 

  
asian paints use to trade at 20-25 pe and same goes for polycab and havells and so may other stocks before then run up. now trading in 2023 at 80-90 pe and growing at 10-15% is not justified that's why they are underperforming because pe will revert back to mean. same happened with Bajaj it was a 80 pe stock and eps went 2.5 times but pe compressed to 27 that's why stock didn't move. 



Growth and long runway is essential for a stock to compound and one needs to invest it at reasonable valuations, today most of mid and small are trading at 70-80 pe so even with all the growth the valuations and price we pay for that growth is not justified.",2024-12-10 08:19:34,13.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hawp77/buy_and_forget_strategy_for_bluechip_stocks/,IndianStockMarket

post,1gj4usz,"Market on 04 nov, 2024",dth999,"Daily journal:

GST collections in October grew 8.9% YOY. Maruti, Tata Motors, Mahindra did record sales this festival season.

These are some signs of revival of the economy. But we have to see if the economy shows growth post the festive season as well.

US markets had a good session on Friday. Futures are trading flat. 10Y Bond Yield is at 4.3%. Brent Oil is at 73$. Dollar Index is at 103. Asian markets are trading in green. Consider global cues as neutral to positive today.

Global markets including Indian markets will remain nervous before the US Elections that are scheduled to be held tomorrow. People will fear to take any big positions and hence the volumes will be low. Markets may remain in a consolidation wait and watch mode.

If Trump wins and makes some big announcements, that can become a positive trigger for the global markets.

Second big trigger for us is our results season of Q2. You will see wild stock specific moves. The results season for the next 2 weeks will be in full swing. The shape of your entire portfolio will change based on the results of different companies you hold.


Coming to the technical view

This is the same chart we were using in October. You see that in the support zone of 24000-24400, consolidation is happening. Nifty attempted to cross this zone quite a few times last month. But all the attempts failed. But the good thing is that it is not breaking it. There is a base being built in exactly the same zone we had marked. Hopefully this should bring strength in the markets and it should break out soon.

Strategy? Deploy some cash gradually in this zone. Hold some more cash for any uncertain event like the US Elections, Middle East War etc. Simple. I had book some profits recently. So I am 90% invested. Slightly above 10% in cash. Extensively studying different companies and will deploy some more soon. Adding some quantities to old portfolio stocks in dips.

post,1g9eofo,Why Market Is Down Today?,SuperbHealth5023,"https://preview.redd.it/vdq61s2g6awd1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=8191c4f34d3929d58b0a0a7cfa42d0d95a12261e

The markets experienced a significant downturn on Tuesday as Hyundai Motors' IPO opened at a 1% discount, leading to declines in Indian benchmark indices. The Sensex fell by 931 points (-1.15%), meanwhile the Nifty dropped by 311.40 points (-1.26%). With 36 of the 50 stocks in the index trading in the red, BEL and Tata Motors were notable losers, although gains in ICICI Bank, Infosys, and Reliance Industries offered some support.

  
The market decline is driven by fears of a U.S. recession, escalating geopolitical tensions, weak corporate earnings, and concerns about stock overvaluation. Investors are engaging in profit booking, while Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have been selling shares amid global uncertainty. Additionally, SEBI's new regulatory changes on derivatives trading, rising crude oil prices, and concerns over upcoming U.S. economic data are adding to market volatility. Together, these factors are contributing to the downturn, prompting a cautious approach from investors.

post,1j3gh06,Deep dive into 4 Wheeler market in India,GodofObertan,"4-wheeler market is ~3,30,000 crores market , 4 wheeler is the only market which continues to hit all-time highs with volumes being 25% higher than 2019, though growth is expected to be low single digits in FY25.


Indian Automobile market is dominated by 4 large players - Maruti, Hyundai, Tata Motors and Mahindra.

Below are the market share trends over the past 15 years.


Usually market share shifts happen due to a change in trend, for example from 2012 to 2019, when Diesel vehicles were going out of favour and CNG Vehicles were picking up, Maruti Suzuki gained ~1300 bps.

Similarly, with large cars and SUV’s being in favour, we have seen them replacing small cars resulting in market share gains for Mahindra and Tata.


Dissecting the 4W market into 2 parts are

Small cars - Hatchbacks and Sedans

In Hatchbacks& Sedans Maruti has 71% & 47% market share. (Swift, Wagon R, Baleno, Dzire, Spresso)

Large Cars - SUV’s and Vans

•In Hatchbacks& Sedans Maruti has 71% & 47% market share. (Swift, Wagon R, Baleno, Dzire, Spresso)

What are the top 10 car models sold in India in FY24 ?

Maruti absolutely dominates the rankings with 6, followed by Tata with 2 and Mahindra and Hyundai with 1 each.


Exports as a market -

Unlike 2W, exports is much a smaller part for 4 wheelers, with exports contributing 20% / 13% to Hyundai and Maruti.




EV -

EV penetration in 4W is largely limited (~2.4% v/s ~5.8% for 2 wheelers) owing to no material presence from top 2 players.

However, launch of Hyundai E-Creta and Maruti Suzuki’s E-Vitara will aid penetration materially in FY26 and beyond.


E-2W is largely captured by Tata Motors due to early and succesful launch of (Nexon, Punch, Curvv and Tiago). MG Windsor and Comet has started picking up well.


EV market share will mature only post 6-7% penetration and clear winners will be identified only post higher penetration.




How has FY25 been for 4 wheelers and where are they placed ?

FY25 till December had been tepid vis - a - vis other categories with growth slower than 2&3 W.


Companies have reported tepid numbers with Mahindra and Toyota outperforming the market at the cost of Tata, Hyundai and Honda.


Conclusion - Broadly 4W has seen slowdown in FY25 so far, though numbers have been encouraging in Q3. There are pockets where each of the companies are placed which can benefit them, broad one liner for where each company is placed and what can help them grow faster.

Maruti Suzuki - Maruti Suzuki has multiple power brands, though MS for Maruti in SUV’s is still tepid. A come back of Sedans and Hatchbacks and strong rural recovery will disproportionately benefit Maruti vis-a-vis other players.

Hyundai - Hyundai’s newer launches especially on E-4W are critical for the company gaining material market share.

Mahindra and Mahindra - Mahindra’s new launches and pick-up of SUV has been well accepted in the market resulting in material MS gains. EV portfolio’s acceptance of M&M will be key to monitor.

Tata Motors - Tata Motors generates ~77% of profit from JLR. Success of JLR is dependent on JLR’s performance in USA, Europe and China. Domestic PV is not a key driver for Tata Motors at this scale",2025-03-04 17:38:22,7.0,8.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1j3gh06/deep_dive_into_4_wheeler_market_in_india/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1j3gh06,,,,,,,mg020hm,FrumpyScrumpy,"I had a pretty heated discussion with someone on EVs and he made pretty good points.

Mainly, his argument was that EVs are limited by their batteries and as a consumer he would never buy an EV because of the costs required to maintain a pure EV car. As a consumer, EVs are cheaper after 15 years of usage which is far beyond what general people use a car for.

Now this may be anecdotal, but these concerns do ring true and he is a quintessential consumer. There is a chance that the EV hype may take a back seat for Indian consumers in the medium term unless they manage to make it more cost effective.",2025-03-04 18:12:53,3.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1j3gh06/deep_dive_into_4_wheeler_market_in_india/,IndianStockMarket

post,1k4vv6z,"SJS Enterprises - Logos, Decals and Aesthetics!!!",GodofObertan,"Original article was posted on Substack. 
https://cashcows.substack.com/p/sjs-enterprises-in-a-sweet-spot-for

The subreddit doesn't allow posting inagesz so if you want a few images you can check out the article above.

Regardless the bulk of the article is written below. 


SJS Enterprises (SJS) is one of the leading players in 
decorative aesthetics Industry catering to 2Ws (34%), PVs (40%) and consumer appliance segments(21%) and others (FMCG, Sanitaryware, Healthcare, Telecom, EMS) (5%). Market size of Decorative Aesthetics is ~2000 crores, whereas for exports it is closer to ~22000 crores.

Prior to 2021, the company was primarily a decorative printing brand. Post acquistion of Exotech and Walter Pack the company has built capabilities in chrome plating and IML/ IMD and IME’s.




What does SJS do ? 

SJS produces decals, logos, 2D appliques and domes to advanced products such as 3D lux logos/badges, 3D appliques, lens, mask assemblies, optical plastics, IMEs and IMLs/IMDs. 



In 2 Wheelers, the company’s bulk of revenues comes from Logo’s, Badges and Body Graphics. 

Key customers in 2 wheelers are TVS, Honda, Bajaj, Royal Enfield, Yamaha and Ola. 

Let’s take an example of a legacy Bajaj Pulsar 150 CC bike and what can SJS manufacture for Pulsar 150 

Bajaj and Pulsar Logo on the body of the bike

Decals including 150 written on the front and the back along with decals on headlight and rims.

Bajaj logo on Engine.




Along with the above example, SJS has introduced newer generation and future ready products  for 2W as attached.




Currently content per vehicle in 2W is  300-500 rupees. 

The key new and future innovations driving increase in content per vehicle in 2W 

3D Speedometers replacing 2D Speedometer & Cover glass for digital screens in 2W. Depending on adoption content per vehicle may increase to 450-1000 rupees a vehicle.



However, important thing to note is 2 W are constrained by size and there is only limited scope of how much a company can innovate and increase content per vehicle as 2W size has remained constant for decades.

With SJS having a very healthy share in 2W and especially bikes, growth in 2W is broadly led by underlying 2W volume growth. 





Passenger vehicles - 

Passenger vehicles have seen a big shift to SUV’s from Hatchbacks and Sedans. We wrote about the Passenger Vehicles Industry to check out what’s driving and who are the beneficiaries. 

Larger the car, leaves more room for aesthetics resulting in disproportionate growth for decorative aesthetics player like SJS.

In 4 wheelers the company supplies to Mahindra, Maruti , Tata, Kia, Hyundai, Morris Garage, Volkswagen, Skoda India and Stellantis. 

In fact Mahindra is the largest client of the company contributing ~14-15% of revenues.

Let’s take Mahindra XUV 700 and see what SJS can manufacture - 

On the exterior - 

Front side SJS can manufacture the logo along with the chrome plating 

On the back-side, Logo’s along with model and rear badges such as XUV 700 and AX7 



On the interior side - 

SJS can manufacture logos and illuminated logos on steering wheel

In-mold decoration

3D Appliques 

Cover glass on screen



Below is the complete portfolio of SJS in PV - 





As seen just by sheer components, PV is a much more exciting market for SJS. Current kit value for a PV is ~INR 2400-3000 per vehicle, though future kit value can increase materially to ~INR 7000-12000 per vehicle which makes PV key driver for growth for the company.



Consumer Discretionary and Others - 

The company manufactures primarily logos and chrome plating for Consumer Discretionary companies.



Key customers in Consumer Goods include Whirlpool (Global), Samsung, Godrej, Eureka Forbes, Legrand

The company also provides logo’s, decals and other decorative aesthetics to EMS, Telecom, Sanitaryware and FMCG companies.

EMS / Telecomm - Dixon, Syrma, Neolync, Seoyon, Wangda, Optiemus.

Sanitaryware, FMCG, others – RIL, Sensacore, Geberit, Roca, Litemed.



How has company fared in 9M FY25 - 

The company has grown slightly slower than 2W industry owing to a higher bike mix which has grown slower.

In PV’s the company has grown at 38% v/s 3% for the industry resulting in ~24% volume growth for SJS v’s 11.2% for the Industry





What can drive growth for SJS Enterprises - 

Increase in SUV market share and increase in content per vehicle

The company has committed capex of ~170-180 crores of capex over next 2 years primarily in increasing capacities in Exotech (~80 crores) and Cover glass (~40 crores)

Exotech is currently running at 95% utilization, hence incremental capacities should be utilized swiftly.

In cover glass, the company will make the cover glass that comes on top of display screen, which give you some very special properties like anti-reflection, anti-glare, antifingerprint. Cover glass can be a big opportunity roughly from maybe Rs.700 a vehicle to close to about Rs.4,000 a vehicle

Increasing Pie of exports from 7% to 13-15% in next 2-3 years



Key Risks - 

 Labour Issues - SJS has had a major strike in 2024 with workers complaining on poor working condition and wrongful termination, both fairly serious concerns.

Material Slowdown in anchor clients -

Mahindra and TVS have been amongst the top anchor clients for SJS Enterprises and they continue to outperform their respective markets. However, any change in the above scenario will h

Failure to Innovate - 

Innovation and acceptance is the backbone in decorative aesthetics segment, and the segment has the highest disruption amongst ancillary players.



Conclusion - Broadly SJS stands in a sweet spot where market size is small and fast growing, there is no EV risk and is amongst the key beneficiaries in the premiumization trend.

post,1h1qsoo,Tata motors,FuelLongjumping6397,"I believe this is in good buying zone..I found below scenarios why it is attractive at current levels

1) it is trading at a PE of around 9 which is way less than its peers like Ashok Leyland, Maruti etc

4) Market share in commercial vehicle segment is high compared to peers

post,1imypig,Market Notes - 11th February,rishris,"The Indian stock market tumbled on February 11, 2025, with the **Sensex plunging 1,018 points (1.32%) to close at 76,293.60** and the **Nifty 50 dropping 310 points (1.32%) to end at 23,071.80**. This marked the fifth consecutive day of losses, driven by widespread selling across sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/53lrwlvriiie1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=c589dc1b3730e9943ea3833913fa02c26b387ac5

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with **Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Metal falling 2-3%**. The broader markets were hit even harder, as the **Midcap index fell 3% and Smallcap index dropped 3.5%**. Market sentiment remained bearish, with over ₹10 lakh crore wiped out in market capitalization.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree in 2025, further pressuring the markets. Among stocks, **Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, and Coal India** were the top losers on Nifty, while **Adani Enterprises and Bharti Airtel** managed to gain.

**Broader Developments:**

**RBI’s Liquidity Boost:**

RBI has announced plans to **double its government securities purchase** to Rs 40,000 crore under the upcoming open market operation on February 13, up from the previously announced Rs 20,000 crore.

This move aims to **address the persistent liquidity deficit in the banking system**, which has lasted for eight consecutive weeks and currently stands at Rs 1.33 lakh crore. The decision follows the **RBI's recent 25 basis point cut in its key interest rate** to stimulate the economy, although no immediate liquidity-boosting measures were announced at that time. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has committed to monitoring financial market conditions and taking appropriate actions to maintain orderly liquidity. The central bank has already injected over Rs 1.5 lakh crore through various measures, including bond purchases, currency swaps, and repo auctions.

The market seemed to have paid no heed to this news and the broader sell off continued even after the announcement.

**FICCI's 61st Quarterly Survey on Manufacturing (QSM)**

The survey highlights sustained growth in India's manufacturing sector during FY 2024. Key findings include:

* **Production & Orders**: 87% of respondents expect higher or stable production in Q4 FY 2024, up from 73% in Q3. Additionally, 85% anticipate more orders.
* **Capacity Utilization & Investment**: Average capacity utilization remains steady at 73%, with over 50% planning investments in the next six months. Paper & Paper Products leads at 90%, while Electronics & Electricals is lowest at 65%.
* **Inventories & Exports**: 84% expect stable or higher inventories in Q4, and 40% foresee export growth compared to last year.
* **Hiring & Interest Rates**: About 40% plan workforce expansion, while the average borrowing rate is 9.3%, with repo rate hikes increasing costs for some.
* **Sectoral Growth**: Strong growth (10-20%) is expected in Electronics & Electricals and Machine Tools, while other sectors anticipate moderate growth (5-10%).
* **Challenges**: Rising production costs, raw material issues, skilled labor shortages, and high power costs persist.

Despite challenges, the sector shows optimism with stable demand, investment plans, and export growth.

**Expert Talks:**

**S. Naren from ICICI AMC recently shared his views on the market and investment strategies. Here are some key takeaways:**

# Focus on Asset Allocation

Naren stressed that **how you divide your money across different assets matters more than picking the right stocks**—it drives nearly 80% of wealth creation. ICICI AMC has been pushing for disciplined asset allocation for the past 18 months. He also believes most investors should **stick to moderate-risk products rather than taking extreme risks.**

# Be Careful with Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Right now, Naren is **cautious about small and mid-cap stocks.** He pointed out that:

* Many of these stocks are **expensive** and there’s a lot of money flowing into them.
* The **quality of new stocks entering the market is questionable.**
* While some small companies do grow big, the reality is **most investors don’t hold them long enough** to benefit.

# What’s Attractive in the Market Right Now?

Naren admitted that **finding undervalued investments isn’t easy right now.** However, a few areas look interesting:

* **Bank fixed deposits (FDs), debt mutual funds, and commercial properties**—these haven’t performed well in recent years, so they may have value.
* **Large-cap stocks aren’t in a bubble, but they aren’t cheap either.**

# Advice for Investors

Naren had some straightforward advice:

* **Understand the risks** of what you’re investing in before putting in your money.
* **Avoid loss-making companies** with high valuations—especially if you’re a new investor.
* **Start with hybrid funds** (a mix of debt and equity) before jumping straight into equity funds.

# What’s Happening Globally?

On the global front, Naren admitted things are **uncertain.** He’s especially watching the **long dollar trade**—if and when it peaks, it could shake things up. The **U.S. market is tricky right now** with frequent policy changes, making it even harder to predict. Given all this, he suggests **taking a balanced, moderate-risk approach.**

# Are We at the Peak of the Market Cycle?

Naren thinks **we might have hit the peak of the last cycle**, considering how easily loss-making companies have been able to raise money. But that doesn’t change India’s long-term growth story—**the country still has a bright future.**

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Naren’s message was simple: **focus on managing risk, follow a disciplined asset allocation strategy, and keep your expectations realistic.**

post,1hx7tlz,Why you should Avoid Defence and EV for atleast a quarter ,Useful-Formal-3130,"We know that last 2 years we made huge money out of these stocks. Special Tata mators, zentch, olectra green, Tata power and waree energy provided immense net worth to the investors. 

Now coming to the part, right now what is happening in the market. EV will be good performing but the problem with them is prices of cars and bikes. They are making range of cars better but what about prices that we pay. 45% car bought in India operated as Taxi Or on rent. Does this market still under penetrate ? Yes because they don't wants to buy a car of 15+ lakh better they are looking for maruti suzuki dzire, swift or tiago with cng.


The market Tata motors serving is global and in this market china, us they are getting huge competition  from BYD, tesla and other new player. This causing them to not to increase prices otherwise sales are going down. Only player in this market is Mahindra who is looking promising with their design and range

Car makers itself all of them are facing challenges due to  middle class not putting hard earned money into the cars. Taxes already at very high and earning are getting lower in hands of middle class. That's clearly seen in the FMCG company sales. Only essential things are getting bought and remain they are ignoring. 


Coming to the defense stocks they already ran a lot. All the stock are almost 3 times in last 2 years. Did you really think their business are got doubled or trippled in these sector. 

Orders are high but all orders not go to complete in the same year. They are long term execution orders like 7-8 years. 

Almost every good investor either decreased or exited from these stock. Only public is remaining in these stocks right now. 

You should avoid these stock for atleast 2 quarter and see them how they are giving the results. If they started giving results of 26+% revenue growth then it going to opportunity otherwise it's waste of money. 

My point is buying growth stocks at lower valuation.

That being said PE of Tata motors is still at very attractive levels, good entry point for long term investors. 

For defence, the global tensions around war are still high. So govt may continue to increase capex in the sector.

Regarding Defense, i agree that all stocks are really hot. I already rode the first wave which happened in last 2 years. But now i am on the side lines and waiting to deploy some more money, but the problem is how arrive at correct valuations. If you read the concals of all the defense companies, you will realise that orders are high and of course they will need more time/year to execute, but more orders are on the horizon so significant CAPEX is being done to increase both capacity and capability.

post,1iwtzxh,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund",Broad-Research5220,"**The Good**:



* In 12 out of 14 years, the fund delivered positive returns, with standout years like **2009 (91.19%)** and **2014 (41.10%)**.
* Sectors like Banking (24.2%) and IT (10.3%) dominate, but it’s not overly concentrated.
* At \~20–30%, the turnover ratio is fine.



**The Bad**:

Between 2015–2022, it often lagged the Nifty 100 TRI during rolling 5-year periods. So, it might struggle in certain market cycles.

**The Ugly**:

A high R-squared (96.64%) means it moves closely with the market, offering little diversification benefit during crashes.

post,1g9dbgo,Few interesting snapshots from my Analysis on Hyundai India,_The_Numbers_Guy,"1. Every year they paid majority of the profit back as dividend but last year they paid double of that. (Negative)
2. The royalty agreement is at 3.5%. Whereas Maruti pays approx 5% (Positive)
3. 20% increase in production capacity. This is inline with Mahindra (Positive)
4. A big chunk of their part suppliers belong to the parent. Hyundai Korea might misuse this through wrongful pricing. Need to watch how OP Margin% changes overtime. (Maybe negative)
5. Valuations are cheaper than Maruti and Mahindra. So not much downside available. (Positive)

Only major risk is corporate governance. If that's neutral, then it's one of the best placed companies. If not, it might be a disaster.

post,1g4wlty,Balanced view about Hyundai Motors India and the IPO,Lazy-Transition8236,"There has been too much negative hype about the Hyundai IPO.

First things first. The IPO is NOT the right time to enter. The GMP is down to hardly 2% of the IPO price band.

But what about the company Hyundai Motors?

Let's dive in.

The company has a 15% market share in India with more than 4 million vehicles sold. Hyundai Motors India also has a global market, being the largest exporter of passenger vehicles from India for more than 20 years.

The main growth opportunity for Hyundai is from the low car ownership rates in India (less than 4% of the population) and the rise in car ownership due to increase in income levels.

The FY24 net profit of the company is at Rs.6060 crores with a CAGR of more than 47% since 2021.

There also comes some risks such as fall in short-term demand that can impact car sales and the profitability of the company.

One more factor that affects the revenue and profitability is the 3.5% of the revenue paid as royalty by Hyundai India to the parent company (which can affect the company further if the royalty percentage is increased).

PE ratio is several times higher than the parent company but the growing Indian market and the company fundamentals justifies the PE ratio to an extent. Also the PE and valuation of Hyundai Motors is close to that of Maruti Suzuki.

One more important observation is that since the IPO size is large, high volume of selling will occur after the listing, leading to a significant fall in share price.

That being said, the other red flags of this IPO still remain such as money from IPO going to the South Korean parent company instead of Hyundai India, share price volatility post-listing, frequent dividend/royalty going to the parent company.

Re-iterating, DO NOT apply for IPO. If you're still particular, observe the GMP towards end of day 3 before taking a call.

What are your observations about the Hyundai IPO or about the company for the long-term?",2024-10-16 10:58:18,0.0,13.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g4wlty/balanced_view_about_hyundai_motors_india_and_the/,IndianStockMarket

Dividend - it is their profits earned from their money / capital invested.  They have every right.  And even after dividend ₹8,000cr is on balance sheet.  

Maruti has upper cap of royalty of 5% to Suzuki Japan.  And it is paying close to this % as of now.  Hyundai is at 3.5% only, almost 33% less.

1. All foreign companies pay royalties to their patent company including HUL, Bosch, ABB, P&G, Colgate etc. Nothing new here. They are mostly in a similar range as Hyundai. Aound 3.5%.


2. In many IPOs, the amount goes to the promoters and parent company and not the company itself. Eg the recent Bajaj Housing IPO. It was massively oversubscribed though all the money went to Bajaj Finance, the parent company.


The only reason people are not investing here is the gmp. If the gmp was good, people would have blindly invested here as well.

post,1h729kj,I think I will Exit Apollo Tyres and Enter TataMotors,trippyleg,"Around 2 months back I invested in Apollo Tyre when it broke 500 mark on the downside. My initial plan was to be invested in it for 1 to 2 years. You can read my reasons below through the link.

Do let me know your thoughts and suggestions.



[My Post on Apollo Tyres](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g3awv6/is_apollo_tyres_a_smart_investment_right_now/)

But now that it has given around 10 percent return in the period; considering the current market, I think i should get out of it, book profit and look at other avenues.

I have been looking at the automobile sector after the recent pull back due to low sales numbers. The 2 wheeler sector looks attractive and Mahindra(for 4 wheelers and CV) seems to be making all the headlines. But i would like to stay clear of the hype.

For me TataMotors at the current level (783)  looks attractive with the valuation. It does have slow growth currently, but it may pick up with the new year sales. Also there is room to improve and capture segment in the low cost EV segment if it goes ahead with its plan to bring in another option at the Tiago level. Which may be a direct competitor for Maruti Celerio and others in the segment.

Also with the plan to demerge the PV and CV segment may act as a trigger. 

On the negative side; Trump taking office in January looks bad for cars manufactured outside USA (in the US market).

  
Note: M&M does look attractive; but the most important reason I am staying away from it is the hype created by the anchors and analyst.",2024-12-05 05:48:47,0.0,4.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1h729kj/i_think_i_will_exit_apollo_tyres_and_enter/,IndianStockMarket

post,1exs9ju,Landmark Cars - Strong Buying Opportunity ,brownchinaboy,"**Condensed Industry and Company Overview**

**Passenger Vehicles Volume Outlook**

Landmark Cars is a major player in the luxury car dealership market in India, operating over 100 outlets across nine states. The Indian passenger vehicle (PV) industry, although still developing, has seen significant growth with nearly 4 million cars sold in FY24. This marks a recovery from a 20% decline during COVID-19 when sales dropped from 3.4 million in FY19 to 2.7 million in FY21. The industry rebounded with a 13% CAGR, indicating strong demand, particularly from first-time buyers.

India’s car penetration is currently low, at about 24 vehicles per 1,000 people, compared to over 120 in China and 250 in Brazil. However, the PV industry is expected to grow at a 10% CAGR over the next decade, potentially doubling car penetration to 45 per 1,000 people.

**Premiumization and Market Fragmentation**

Premiumization is driving growth in the Indian PV market, with a shift toward more expensive vehicles. Even during economic downturns, the demand for premium vehicles, particularly SUVs, has surged. Over the past decade, while overall vehicle sales grew at a modest 4% CAGR, SUV sales increased at a 14% CAGR, reflecting a clear trend toward higher-end vehicles.

The market has also seen fragmentation, with traditional players like Maruti Suzuki losing market share to premium-focused brands like Tata Motors, Mahindra, Kia, and MG Motors. Five years ago, the top four players controlled 82% of the market, but today they account for 79%, with premium brands steadily gaining ground.

**Luxury Cars Volume Outlook**

The luxury car segment in India is poised for rapid growth. Despite accounting for less than 1% of total PV sales in FY24, the potential for expansion is enormous. Comparatively, luxury cars make up 18% of the market in China and over 23% in the U.S. India's luxury car market, while small, is at an inflection point, with a 20% CAGR expected over the next decade. Although luxury currently lags behind global peers, increasing GDP per capita and changing consumer preferences indicate a promising future.

**Luxury Cars Competition**

The luxury car market is dominated by a few major players, with Mercedes and BMW controlling 81% of the market. Globally, luxury car markets are more consolidated, and brand loyalty plays a significant role. Mercedes, in particular, is expected to remain a key player in India, although it may face competition from new entrants.

**Luxury Car Dealerships**

Operating a luxury car dealership in India is more profitable than mass-market dealerships. Luxury car dealers enjoy higher returns, with gross margins significantly better in the aftermarket business, which includes services like insurance, financing, and spares. These services are less cyclical and offer higher returns on capital employed (ROCE), making them a crucial part of the business strategy.

Landmark, the largest Mercedes dealer in India, has a strong position in the market, often holding monopolistic control in specific regions. This concentration ensures stable margins and high customer retention, particularly in the aftermarket segment.

**Company Overview: Landmark Cars**

Landmark Cars is India’s largest luxury car dealership operator, representing nine brands across nine states. The company is a key player for many of these brands, including Mercedes, where it handles 16% of the brand’s volume sales in India and over 50% in its core states. Landmark’s strategy is to dominate regional markets, ensuring high new car margins and strong customer retention for aftersales services.

**Thesis: Mercedes-Driven Growth**

Investing in Landmark is essentially betting on the growth of luxury car sales in India, with a significant focus on Mercedes. Mercedes accounts for 35% of Landmark’s new car sales but contributes more to profitability due to the asset-light “retail of the future” (ROTF) model. Under this model, Mercedes retains ownership of the inventory and pays Landmark a fixed commission, resulting in higher gross margins and faster payback on new showrooms.

Landmark is expanding its network of Mercedes dealerships, especially in new regions where it will focus on servicing rather than sales. This expansion is expected to drive a 20% CAGR in Mercedes-related revenues over the next decade, with significant growth in aftermarket services.

**Challenges and Diversification**

Outside Mercedes, some of Landmark’s other OEM partnerships are struggling. Renault and Jeep have underperformed, leading to dealership closures. However, Landmark is optimistic about a turnaround for Honda and Volkswagen. Despite these challenges, Landmark’s diversified OEM portfolio and its ability to maintain stable margins even with underperforming brands mitigate some of the risks.

**Growth Opportunities**

Landmark is well-positioned to benefit from the introduction of new OEMs like Mahindra, Kia, MG Motor, and BYD, which are rapidly gaining market share. These partnerships, combined with the potential for 3P servicing growth, particularly for owners dissatisfied with unorganized servicing options, offer significant growth opportunities.

The insurance, financing, and used car sales segments, though currently small, are expected to grow rapidly, driven by increasing new car sales and industry trends toward organized used car markets.

**Management and Culture**

Landmark was founded by Sanjay Thakker, who remains the majority owner. The company operates with a decentralized structure, with each OEM having its own CEO and specific KPIs. The core management team, including Mr. Paras Somani (Mercedes business), Mr. Ravi Shankar (overall business), and Mr. Devang Dave (aftersales), has been instrumental in Landmark’s success. The decentralized approach has allowed Landmark to remain agile and focused on its key growth drivers.

**Risks**

The primary risks include reliance on OEMs, particularly Mercedes, for product cycles and growth. Dealer competition and industry growth are also potential challenges. However, Landmark’s strong relationships with OEMs and its diversified portfolio provide some protection against these risks.

**TLDR**

Stock down because of negative profits, but profits are only negative because of fixed costs from new stores. Sales growth and same store profits growth is strong.",2024-08-21 15:17:02,23.0,10.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1exs9ju/landmark_cars_strong_buying_opportunity/,IndianStockMarket

Now I am considering if I should go with a PMS (some options are Liquide black/Kedia securities. I am also checking for one of my aqquitances who manages PMS and is a ex Axis bank employee used to manage HNIs

Talk about Liquide they charge currently have a flat structure of 30k annually and provides a 360 approach to investing including tax planning. They will have around 10 custom stocks and plan to deploy funds over 2 weeks in the market. I was a bit concerned about it but they said they are taking money from equity and reinvesting into other stocks so not really a risk persay. Also folio will be managed by me 100% they just act as advisory.

Over the years I feel it is better to have specialists working (like a team of yours) that makes life easier. I'll be happy if I can get a 17%-18% CAGR and peaceful sleep

Your thoughts please.. I'm sharing snapshot of my folio (from Zerodha) and parents folio (excel) so you have a fair idea on how I have performed (everyone has performed in the bull market 😁)

Your recommendations are really appreciated, Thank You :)",2024-07-19 18:47:53,3.0,14.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1e7b8gb/portfolio_query_is_pms_a_viable_option/,IndianStockMarket
comment,1e7b8gb,,,,,,,ldz6h85,None,"One simple thing. You can't hold stocks for long on someone's suggestions, you will start to doubt yourself and advisory in a bear market. Understand the market, pick undervalued, growing, quality stocks, invest and forget. Your stock picking skills are good IMO. Just hold for long. No advisory will come in help if COVID or 2008 crash repeats, you are most likely to sell those in panic and due to lack of understanding the business. ☺️ I'm not much qualified to advice, still I have heard these from my father. He was approached by a PMS manager, but luckily he got away from it. Now he holds many 10-20-30-40+ baggers. I'm more focused towards studying and picking growing smallcaps in value zone. Anyways PMS won't help in any market. Check historic returns of popular PMFs. Compare it with an index fund. You will yourself beat them if you have conviction on business and hold.

comment,1e7b8gb,,,,,,,m5typ79,tadmasan,"For a portfolio exceeding ₹1 crore, a PMS (Portfolio Management Service) is often a wise choice. Here’s why:

1. **Professional Expertise**: PMS ensures active monitoring and management by experts with a dedicated research team.
2. **Better Returns**: With the right firm, you can expect consistent returns, often exceeding 15% CAGR over the long term (5+ years).
3. **Peace of Mind**: Delegating your portfolio management reduces stress and lets you focus on other priorities.

**My Recommendations**:  
Avoid smaller players like Liquide. Instead, consider reputed firms like **360One** and **Alchemy Capital**. Both have a proven track record and are trusted by many HNIs, including several of my own clients who are extremely happy with the performance and stability of their PMS investments.

post,1g3lkks,Hyundai IPO views,Primary-Item4727,"Let's discuss some points for the ipo to discuss 


Q)why is the GMP so low.
I believe that the ipo is very big, a 27000 crore and due to which allotment to everyone is quite possible hence no GMP.


Q) long term perspective 
The company is among the top three auto manufacturers and would be included in almost 90% of the indexes like nifty auto, largecaps, and possibly in nifty 50 or next 50 as well hence inflows of the retailers sip inflows. 


Q) are valuations high
I would say that the valuations are reasonable, not low but not so high. Valuations are at par with maruti suzuki but its market share isn't. The valuations could have been better.

post,1gfiwa1,"Indian Stock Market Overview: Performance and Sector Focus for October 29, 2024",Ok-Jackfruit1957,"The Indian stock market experienced a mixed day on October 29, 2024, with fluctuations in key indices influenced by various factors, including global cues and sector-specific performances.

# Market Performance Overview

* **Sensex**: The BSE Sensex closed at **80,369.03**, up by **363.99 points** or **0.45%**. It had a volatile session, dipping as low as **79,421.35** before recovering towards the end of the trading day
* **Nifty 50**: The NSE Nifty rose by **127.70 points**, or **0.52%**, finishing at **24,466.85**. The index initially faced resistance around the **24,500** mark but managed to close above it after some buying activity in banking stocks

# Sector Highlights

* **Banking Stocks**: A notable uptick was seen in banking stocks, significantly contributing to the market's gains. State Bank of India (SBI) surged by **5%**, while ICICI Bank also reported positive performance, buoyed by favorable quarterly results[](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/share-market-highlights-29-october-2024-sensex-closes-8036903-nifty-up-by-052-at-12770-top-gainers-sbi-icic-bank/article68807042.ece)
* **Top Gainers**: Key gainers included:
   * SBI (+5%)
   * ICICI Bank
   * Bajaj Finserv
   * NTPC
   * Adani Ports
* **Lagging Stocks**: Conversely, stocks such as Maruti, Tata Motors, Sun Pharma, and IndusInd Bank faced declines

# Market Sentiment and Predictions

Despite the day's gains, market sentiment remained cautious. Analysts noted that the Nifty's resistance at **24,500** held firm, indicating potential challenges ahead for further upward movement. The advance/decline ratio reflected a broader negative sentiment with more declines than advances noted in the trading session

# Key Levels to Watch

* **Support Levels**: Immediate support for Nifty is seen at **24,100**, followed by **23,900**.
* **Resistance Levels**: Key resistance levels are at **24,500** and potentially moving towards **24,700** if momentum builds up

Overall, while the Indian stock market showed resilience with gains in specific sectors like banking, traders are advised to remain stock-specific and cautious given the prevailing market dynamics and resistance levels faced by major indices",2024-10-30 09:58:59,1.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gfiwa1/indian_stock_market_overview_performance_and/,IndianStockMarket

post,1ezfc2p,will there be decline in the auto sector?,VISHAL_JAISWAL1988,"The auto sector is considered to be the best sector to invest in. Some AMCs have mutual fund schemes related to this sector only, like SBI AUTOMOTIVE OPP FUND. The share price of MARUTI has increased by 27.82% since last year. Similarly, the share price of TATA MO has climbed to Rs.1035 from Rs. 635 in the last year. The trend of EV is running the revenue of TATA MO, but the MARUTI is running the revenue without introducing EVs. 

However, recent news regarding the dealers' inventory raises concerns about future revenue. The news reports that the dealers have over Rs. 73000 Crores of inventories with them. This is a clear indication that the consumer class will see huge discount offerings on cars in the coming festive seasons.

**Industry overview**  
  
  
The Global PV sales in CY2023 was dominated by Toyota Group at 11.1 million, followed by Volkswagen Group with 9.2 million units and Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai + Kia) with 7.3 million units, with **Hyundai group being 3rd largest global passenger vehicle ( PV) maker.**  
  
**According to CRISIL MI&A, India had 26 cars per 1,000 people as of Fiscal 2024.** Although the penetration grew from 22 cars per 1000 people in Fiscals 2019 to 26 cars as of Fiscal 2024, it is significantly lower than the developed nations and even emerging nations like Brazil, Russia, and Mexico. This provides significant headroom for growth, especially given the expected increase in disposable incomes, faster economic growth, younger population, and increased focus from international OEMs.  
  
As per CRISIL MI&A, Indian economy is expected to surpass US$5 trillion mark over the next seven fiscals (2025- 2031) and inching closer to US$7 trillion. A projected average GDP growth of 6.7% in this period will make India the third-largest economy in the world and lift per capita income to the upper middle-income category. **By Fiscal 2031, India’s per capita income will rise to approximately US$4,500, thereby making it an upper middle-income nation.**  
  
Between FY19 and FY24 , India’s domestic PV sales volume rose at 5% CAGR. This growth was despite the sales contraction (at 10% CAGR) witnessed during Fiscals 2019 to 2021. Sales were 3.9 million vehicles in Fiscal 2023. **CRISIL MI&A expects the industry to clock 4.5-6.5% CAGR between FY24 to FY29 period to reach 5.2-5.7 million domestic vehicle sales.**  
  
**Premiumization trend in Cars**

B/w FY21 and FY23 , car industry by value increased by 36% due to- premiumization- preference of SUVs- increase in prices due to emission norms-raw material price hike

**ASP( Avg selling price) rose from 491000rs to 659000rs b/w FY19 and FY23.**  
  
**Segment share of SUVs rose from 23% to 50% in FY24 at 23% CAGR.** Recognizing the changing consumer preferences, OEMs also launched higher number of vehicles in the SUV segment. The mid-size SUV segment (24% CAGR) outpaced the entire SUV segment. Continued traction for the high selling models like Hyundai Creta & Kia Seltos as well as Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara, Toyota Urban cruiser Hyryder, and Honda Elevate provided the thrust to the growth of mid-size SUVs. **The share of small cars (hatchbacks) reduced from 46.9% in Fiscal 2019 to 34.4% in Fiscal 2023.**  
  
The hatchbacks segment lost market share owing to  
- lack of new model launches  
-frequent hikes in vehicle prices  
-increase in operating costs amid fuel price hikes  
-an unfavourable macroeconomic environment that impacted the price sensitive entry-level customer base  
  
  
Domestic PV industry is an oligopolistic market with few players dominating the entire industry. Maruti Suzuki is the market leader ,Hyundai Motor India second largest contributor to the domestic sales, followed by Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra. These 4 players together contribute approximately 80% of the market.

**Operating metrics**  
  
Hyundai has sold following number of cars in FY24-  
ICE 506,250  
CNG 60,320  
EV 975  
  
Hyundai has lost some share in the hatchbacks segment in the last 5 years. Discontinuation of its compact hatchbacks Santro and Eon impacted the company’s share within the hatchbacks segment. Intensified competition with entry of new models Tata Altroz and Toyota Glanza in the premium hatchbacks segment exerted pressure on its share in the premium hatchbacks sub-segment in the last 5 years.  
  
In the compact sedans segment, Maruti Suzuki leads with a market share of approximately 58.5%, from the Dzire model. **Following Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai holds a share of around 19.8%, attributed to Aura model.** **In the premium sedans segment, Hyundai Motor India dominates with a 31.2% market share**, driven by sale of its only model Verna.  
  
Compared to other segments, the SUV segment is much more fragmented with no clear leader and very close competition between the OEMs. Hyundai dominates the mid-size SUV sub segment. **With its flagship model Creta, Hyundai commanded a leading 30% market share.**  
  
**Hyundai has more than 1,350 sales touchpoints across India.** Maruti Suzuki has about 3,250 touchpoints in India. **Hyundai has 1500 service touchpoints**, while Maruti has 4,560 service touchpoints. In terms of sales+ service touchpoints, Hyundai is 2nd largest after Maruti.  
  
Maruti leads the industry with PV market share of 41.3%. Hyundai used to be undisputed 2nd player for long, **but currently at 14.6% market share** where Tata Motors is breathing at its shoulders with 14% market share.  
Operating margins are higher for Mahindra at 12.3% due to being an only SUV player.

**Points to consider**  


Entire Auto industry is standing at crossroads to move on towards renewable energy like EV, CNG, Hybrid- so lot of technological change related investments has to be made by all players in coming few years. It is not clear which technology will emerge as winner, so incumbents must invest in all of them.  
  
**Top 5 suppliers constitute 44% of materials and top 10 suppliers constitute 59% of materials.17% of parts are sourced from Korea.**

**Hyundai has to pay 3.5% of revenues as royalty cost to HMC for R&D and manufacturing technology transfer.**  
  
Related party transactions in expenses side is 32% and 9% on the sales side.  
  
**HMC holds 34.16% stake in Kia Corporation** which operates in the automobile industry in India through its subsidiary, Kia India Private Limited. HMC’s chairman is also the chairman of Kia. HMI also supplies engines to Kia for their vehicles. Given the potential product overlaps between HMI's offerings and those of Kia in India, there is no assurance that conflicts of interest won't happen in future.  
  
12% of sales come from Middle East/Europe , 7% of sales come from Latin America, 4% from Africa, **so dependence on Exports is there for 23% of revenues.**  
  
**Capacity utilization in 9M FY24 is 97% , so until Talegaon plant comes up ( H2 FY26), there is capacity constraints for Hyundai**.  
  
They depend on subsidiary Mobis India for spare parts supplies.",2024-07-13 18:29:52,8.0,7.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1e2h9lu/hyundai_ipo_analysis/,IndianStockMarket

post,1ixrvi6,"For those Investing in Auto Stocks (Hyundai, Tata, Mahindra and Maruti Suzuki), this is what is happening in Feb 2025",Apprehensive-Mix-45,"So I have been rigorously following Vahan and other sources and this is what is happening in Car market for month of Feb 2025

1. Hyundai Creta is not performing well, with only 500 creta EV sold this month is 4 percent of total Creta sales and that's not good start
2. Mahindra is leading Hyundai and Tata this month, deliveries of Mocha interior Thar Roxx have begun
3. It is neck to neck fight in EV sector between Tata and MG.. just 100 unit difference between both companies and Tata who had 80 percent share are down to 55 this month
4. BMW is leading on Mercedes this year. BMW with attractive preposition and lack of radical EVs has found an edge to Mercedes who are going left and right.
5. If this go on like this we will see BMW overtake Renault soon. Renault is underperforming single car unit Nissan this month
6. Tata has lots to ponder.. they will end up with sun 30k sales this month and they really need to come up with some strategy to arrest this fall.
7. Mahindra's EV start production next month though dispatches have already begun.. Mahindra looks at 40k sales this month.
8. Even Suzuki is doing decent albeit not amazing this month but their inventory was cleared off so they will be chill
9. Hyundai is seriously losing out, Creta EV maybe first Creta to flop and now they are a Creta led company.. almost all other models are not doing well..
10. Feb sales are down, I believe most purchase decisions are delayed due to Holi and March discounts. Tax cuts and Repo rate cuts will see effect in next quarter.. although this is not good start for car market

Overall scenario

M&M is doing good and have seen strong response for their BEV that are going on sale next month

 Maruti is holding on and will see positive uptick on back of Jimny demand in Japan and opening of Kharkhoda plant in Haryana 

Hyundai since listing has been struggling and the struggle is bigger this month as they lose 2nd spot to Mahindra in retail sales

Tata is on a downward spiral and this month sales are really low. They are on edge of getting triumphed in EV sales unless they do price correction",2025-02-25 10:23:48,1.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1ixrvi6/for_those_investing_in_auto_stocks_hyundai_tata/,StockMarketIndia

post,1jd5p5w,How IPOs makes fool to the retailers.,Useful-Formal-3130,"Mostly I recommend people to always sell the ipo just a after it get listed. After listed gain there will not be more left in the companies. 

Take recent ipo of sula vineyard, dreamfolks etc


Most of the companies really think retailers are fool and they many making machines. 

First they increase their ebita margins and wait for right time when market is up and bring their ipo. This way they tell the people we are just bringing our ipo at fair valuation at PE of 30 which according to market. 

They don't tell you they had increase their margins hence their profits seems to be 60-70% extra in their profit loss statement. You are not buying at PE of 30 their shares. Actually you are buying 50-55 PE in real terms if you remove their inflated profits. 

Take example of Mama Earth. That fucking company owner itself has crores of money but they want money of retail small investors by doing fake things. No one going probe them. 

They sold their products huge to distributor before IPO just to show the profit of the company and take money at higher prices from investors. 

I still think if anyone having 10-15 cr he can live best of his life but why they want more money by doing fake things. They can still earn money by doing good business. 

Look at sula vineyard people made it famous and now look their ebita margins fallen from 32-35% to 25-26%. Itself deeps the profits by 25-26%.

Look. At dreamfolks they bought ipo at 13% now the margins are just 7%.
Half of the margins. Promotor of the company sold her shares in IPO and she again selling her shares every quarter

She already knows margins going to go down hence this will be best time to. Invest. 

But she never going to tell on IPO day that further margins not going to sustain or drop from here. 


My suggestion to all the people is don't even try to burn you hands in IPO. Personally I never applied in my to any IPO. 

Best is there are 100s of company which are trusted better growth and getting at lower valuation then why you wants to burn your hands in IPO. Or after IPO in these stocks. 


If you are normal investor wants to earn 16-18% then just buy 10 large cap which are growing by 13-15% their sales. 

Example:- Bajaj finance, pidilite, ITC, Sanofi, SKf India, maruti, mahindra 

Even if you take position in this stock right now s you are going to make 14% with 1.3% of avg dividend. Thats total return will come at 15%. That very decent return. People don't understand without doing anything you are getting 15% return on your money. 

The people who are in mutual fund then that too are best but only things is you needs to learn how to fund good mutual funds and how to diversify them

comment,1isw7ht,,,,,,,mdlppys,ParsnipLucky2316,"Sorry for a very very noob question but pls do reply.

If I made a lumpsum investment in NIFTY 50 mutual fund on 1994 then I have received ""fractions of each shares "" present in Nifty 50 at 1994.

Now when i sell the same in 2024, 75% of the 1994 stocks have already lost the shine. So i would be getting good profit from ""fractions of stocks"" like Unilever/SBI/Reliance who have survived this 20 year ride.  , so ultimately i would be receiving very less profit when i redeem in 2024 as valuations of All other stocks has reduced too much

post,1k500fx,SJS Enterprises - Driving Premiumization,GodofObertan,"Original article was posted on Substack. 
https://cashcows.substack.com/p/sjs-enterprises-in-a-sweet-spot-for

The subreddit doesn't allow posting inagesz so if you want a few images you can check out the article above.

Regardless the bulk of the article is written below. 


SJS Enterprises (SJS) is one of the leading players in 
decorative aesthetics Industry catering to 2Ws (34%), PVs (40%) and consumer appliance segments(21%) and others (FMCG, Sanitaryware, Healthcare, Telecom, EMS) (5%). Market size of Decorative Aesthetics is ~2000 crores, whereas for exports it is closer to ~22000 crores.

Prior to 2021, the company was primarily a decorative printing brand. Post acquistion of Exotech and Walter Pack the company has built capabilities in chrome plating and IML/ IMD and IME’s.




What does SJS do ? 

SJS produces decals, logos, 2D appliques and domes to advanced products such as 3D lux logos/badges, 3D appliques, lens, mask assemblies, optical plastics, IMEs and IMLs/IMDs. 



In 2 Wheelers, the company’s bulk of revenues comes from Logo’s, Badges and Body Graphics. 

Key customers in 2 wheelers are TVS, Honda, Bajaj, Royal Enfield, Yamaha and Ola. 

Let’s take an example of a legacy Bajaj Pulsar 150 CC bike and what can SJS manufacture for Pulsar 150 

Bajaj and Pulsar Logo on the body of the bike

Decals including 150 written on the front and the back along with decals on headlight and rims.

Bajaj logo on Engine.




Along with the above example, SJS has introduced newer generation and future ready products  for 2W as attached.




Currently content per vehicle in 2W is  300-500 rupees. 

The key new and future innovations driving increase in content per vehicle in 2W 

3D Speedometers replacing 2D Speedometer & Cover glass for digital screens in 2W. Depending on adoption content per vehicle may increase to 450-1000 rupees a vehicle.



However, important thing to note is 2 W are constrained by size and there is only limited scope of how much a company can innovate and increase content per vehicle as 2W size has remained constant for decades.

With SJS having a very healthy share in 2W and especially bikes, growth in 2W is broadly led by underlying 2W volume growth. 





Passenger vehicles - 

Passenger vehicles have seen a big shift to SUV’s from Hatchbacks and Sedans. We wrote about the Passenger Vehicles Industry to check out what’s driving and who are the beneficiaries. 

Larger the car, leaves more room for aesthetics resulting in disproportionate growth for decorative aesthetics player like SJS.

In 4 wheelers the company supplies to Mahindra, Maruti , Tata, Kia, Hyundai, Morris Garage, Volkswagen, Skoda India and Stellantis. 

In fact Mahindra is the largest client of the company contributing ~14-15% of revenues.

Let’s take Mahindra XUV 700 and see what SJS can manufacture - 

On the exterior - 

Front side SJS can manufacture the logo along with the chrome plating 

On the back-side, Logo’s along with model and rear badges such as XUV 700 and AX7 



On the interior side - 

SJS can manufacture logos and illuminated logos on steering wheel

In-mold decoration

3D Appliques 

Cover glass on screen



Below is the complete portfolio of SJS in PV - 





As seen just by sheer components, PV is a much more exciting market for SJS. Current kit value for a PV is ~INR 2400-3000 per vehicle, though future kit value can increase materially to ~INR 7000-12000 per vehicle which makes PV key driver for growth for the company.



Consumer Discretionary and Others - 

The company manufactures primarily logos and chrome plating for Consumer Discretionary companies.



Key customers in Consumer Goods include Whirlpool (Global), Samsung, Godrej, Eureka Forbes, Legrand

The company also provides logo’s, decals and other decorative aesthetics to EMS, Telecom, Sanitaryware and FMCG companies.

EMS / Telecomm - Dixon, Syrma, Neolync, Seoyon, Wangda, Optiemus.

Sanitaryware, FMCG, others – RIL, Sensacore, Geberit, Roca, Litemed.



How has company fared in 9M FY25 - 

The company has grown slightly slower than 2W industry owing to a higher bike mix which has grown slower.

In PV’s the company has grown at 38% v/s 3% for the industry resulting in ~24% volume growth for SJS v’s 11.2% for the Industry





What can drive growth for SJS Enterprises - 

Increase in SUV market share and increase in content per vehicle

The company has committed capex of ~170-180 crores of capex over next 2 years primarily in increasing capacities in Exotech (~80 crores) and Cover glass (~40 crores)

Exotech is currently running at 95% utilization, hence incremental capacities should be utilized swiftly.

In cover glass, the company will make the cover glass that comes on top of display screen, which give you some very special properties like anti-reflection, anti-glare, antifingerprint. Cover glass can be a big opportunity roughly from maybe Rs.700 a vehicle to close to about Rs.4,000 a vehicle

Increasing Pie of exports from 7% to 13-15% in next 2-3 years



Key Risks - 

 Labour Issues - SJS has had a major strike in 2024 with workers complaining on poor working condition and wrongful termination, both fairly serious concerns.

Material Slowdown in anchor clients -

Mahindra and TVS have been amongst the top anchor clients for SJS Enterprises and they continue to outperform their respective markets. However, any change in the above scenario will h

Failure to Innovate - 

Innovation and acceptance is the backbone in decorative aesthetics segment, and the segment has the highest disruption amongst ancillary players.



Conclusion - Broadly SJS stands in a sweet spot where market size is small and fast growing, there is no EV risk and is amongst the key beneficiaries in the premiumization trend.

post,1j4wbuz,BYD's Trailblazer Move 😧,Piyush4758,"
BYD's recently taken a game changer move to disrupt entire EV segments for a car manufacturing companies. 

Most car companies like Tata, Maruti, Mahindra in India, and global brands like Volkswagen and Tesla sell ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) as a premium feature. ADAS includes things like automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, and other smart driving aids. Automakers charge extra for these features to boost their profits. For example, Tesla can charge up to $8,000 just for ADAS.

But BYD, a Chinese car company, is changing the game. They’ve made ADAS a standard feature in all their cars without any extra cost. This is similar to how seat belts, airbags, and air conditioners used to be paid add-ons in Indian cars a decade ago but are now standard. Once something becomes standard, it can’t command a high price anymore.

This strategy is working big time for BYD. In January, they sold more cars than Tesla in the UK, grew 6x in a year, and even beat Toyota in Singapore to become the No.1 car brand. In Brazil, their sales grew 4x in a year.

If BYD continues like this, it could force other carmakers to drop ADAS prices, hurting their profits. However, Indian carmakers like Tata and Mahindra are safe for now because the Indian government has put strict rules that slow down BYD’s entry into India.

This move by BYD is a big disruption for the global car market.

post,1imurxj,Deep Dive into 4 Wheeler market in India,GodofObertan,"
4-wheeler market is ~3,30,000 crores market , 4 wheeler is the only market which continues to hit all-time highs with volumes being 25% higher than 2019, though growth is expected to be low single digits in FY25.


Indian Automobile market is dominated by 4 large players - Maruti, Hyundai, Tata Motors and Mahindra.

Below are the market share trends over the past 15 years.


Usually market share shifts happen due to a change in trend, for example from 2012 to 2019, when Diesel vehicles were going out of favour and CNG Vehicles were picking up, Maruti Suzuki gained ~1300 bps.

Similarly, with large cars and SUV’s being in favour, we have seen them replacing small cars resulting in market share gains for Mahindra and Tata.


Dissecting the 4W market into 2 parts are

Small cars - Hatchbacks and Sedans

In Hatchbacks& Sedans Maruti has 71% & 47% market share. (Swift, Wagon R, Baleno, Dzire, Spresso)

Large Cars - SUV’s and Vans

•In Hatchbacks& Sedans Maruti has 71% & 47% market share. (Swift, Wagon R, Baleno, Dzire, Spresso)

What are the top 10 car models sold in India in FY24 ?

Maruti absolutely dominates the rankings with 6, followed by Tata with 2 and Mahindra and Hyundai with 1 each.


Exports as a market -

Unlike 2W, exports is much a smaller part for 4 wheelers, with exports contributing 20% / 13% to Hyundai and Maruti.




EV -

EV penetration in 4W is largely limited (~2.4% v/s ~5.8% for 2 wheelers) owing to no material presence from top 2 players.

However, launch of Hyundai E-Creta and Maruti Suzuki’s E-Vitara will aid penetration materially in FY26 and beyond.


E-2W is largely captured by Tata Motors due to early and succesful launch of (Nexon, Punch, Curvv and Tiago). MG Windsor and Comet has started picking up well.


EV market share will mature only post 6-7% penetration and clear winners will be identified only post higher penetration.




How has FY25 been for 4 wheelers and where are they placed ?

FY25 till December had been tepid vis - a - vis other categories with growth slower than 2&3 W.


Companies have reported tepid numbers with Mahindra and Toyota outperforming the market at the cost of Tata, Hyundai and Honda.


Conclusion - Broadly 4W has seen slowdown in FY25 so far, though numbers have been encouraging in Q3. There are pockets where each of the companies are placed which can benefit them, broad one liner for where each company is placed and what can help them grow faster.

Maruti Suzuki - Maruti Suzuki has multiple power brands, though MS for Maruti in SUV’s is still tepid. A come back of Sedans and Hatchbacks and strong rural recovery will disproportionately benefit Maruti vis-a-vis other players.

Hyundai - Hyundai’s newer launches especially on E-4W are critical for the company gaining material market share.

Mahindra and Mahindra - Mahindra’s new launches and pick-up of SUV has been well accepted in the market resulting in material MS gains. EV portfolio’s acceptance of M&M will be key to monitor.

Tata Motors - Tata Motors generates ~77% of profit from JLR. Success of JLR is dependent on JLR’s performance in USA, Europe and China. Domestic PV is not a key driver for Tata Motors at this scale",2025-02-11 09:26:09,0.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1imurxj/deep_dive_into_4_wheeler_market_in_india/,StockMarketIndia

post,1hfgp9k,Highlights of PPFAS unit holders meet 2024^,Intrepid_Self4652,"We had a productive meeting with the [PPFAS Mutual Fund](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ppfas-mutual-fund/) team, which included [Rajeev Thakkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeev-thakkar-715b3b1b1/), [Raunak Onkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raunakonkar/), [Neil Parikh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-parikh-465b98187/), [Raj Mehta, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-mehta-cfa-8b8630a1/), [Rukun Tarachandani, CFA, CQF](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rukun-tarachandani-cfa-cqf-19765518/) & [Mansi Kariya, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansi-kariya-cfa/). Here are the highlights:  
  
Ø Achieving financial goals > beating benchmarks  
Ø Investment success is driven by asset allocation and compounding duration over individual stock/scheme selection  
Ø Midcap starts at 80k cr market cap and small-cap at 25k crore - no concerns regarding PPFAS Flexi Cap AUM  
Ø 4.5 lakh crores are invested in thematic/sectoral funds  
Ø No update from RBI on overseas investments. This question is asked to new governor now  
Ø Optimistic on India, but cautious due to high valuations. 80% invested but maintain 20% cash  
Ø Promoters are selling stakes (e.g., Whirlpool, Hyundai, LG, Walmart in Flipkart), while QIP activity and PE exits increase. Retail investors focus on SIPs, while promoters find value in QIPs  
Ø Okay to lose 50% of clients through redemptions than losing 50% of clients’ money by doing foolish things on investment side  
Ø Exposure to AI through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. Solar exposure is via transmission companies  
Ø Conservative Hybrid Funds cap equity at 25%. DAAF has a minimum of 35% equity. CHF taxation is as per slab rates, while DAAF offers LTCG benefits beyond 2 years. CHF can invest in REITs/InvITs; DAAF cannot  
Ø Rising investments in small-cap, mid-cap, thematic funds, AIFs, PMS, and smallcases explain their resilience in current market relative to large companies  
Ø BSE was a miss. Thought NSE would be a dominant player, but BSE made a remarkable comeback. Participated through CDSL.  
Ø Maruti (PF stock) – Only a pure four-wheeler play (others have commercial vehicle, investments in other subsidiary) – tracking M&M, Tata motors too. Maruti have missed on SUV, EV front but its fine – as technologies are still evolving  
Ø Sold UTI AMC & Bajaj Auto due to valuations. Question on capital markets – due to new IND AS, earnings volatility has increased a lot. Capital market business is inherently volatile and IND AS have made them more. Run up in stocks has gone up – so trimmed/sold  
Ø ITC – Not as attractive as it was when we bought. Still reasonable valued now. On ITC Hotels – demerged and asset-light  
Ø Overall investment returns are driven by three factors: Dividend yield, Earnings growth, P/E multiple (going up/steady/down)  
Ø Liquidity – to be looked from 2-3 factors in conjunction. First – how much of your investment strategy depends upon the churn (buy and hold ours). Second – Client concentration (less than 2% for our #1 client)  
Ø In India, perception has built up mid/small cap co.s will do well than large caps. In USA, its reverse. Not always true.  
Ø HDFC Bank being a biggie does not mean it’s at a disadvantage  
Ø Smaller AUM of PPFAS Tax saver does not give advantage to PPFAS Flexi. We follow the same approach. Just – no foreign stocks & arbitrage allowed. Tax saver – min. 80% invested all time. Flexi – 65%.

Ø PPFAS DAAF maintains a fixed income duration of 3.25–3.5 years  
Ø On government regulation – you cannot avoid this is probably any sector (pvt or public)  
Ø Exited Accelya Kale due to concerns over its parent’s product roadmap  
Ø Missed Nvidia. Fundamental assumption was wrong in this case.  
Ø Succession plan – we have alignment of interests. Financially: ESOPs, investments in PPFAS units, on the same page on strategy, organization moving forward. Built a relationship that has passed professional things.  
Ø Exploring a new asset class (10L min.) under evolving guidelines  
Ø No plans for the AMC IPO for next couple of years  
Ø On ESG: Governance – we consider this even before ESG was a thing. E & S part – neutral. Business is not black & white.  
Ø Real estate is difficult for conviction-led investing, but proxies look attractive. Book – Inside Real Estate by Sushil Sayal. Surprised if we buy any RE developer in next 3-6 months.  
Ø We do track momentum, factor based (volatility of business etc.). Models are built to identify long term trends  
Ø Hiring a financial advisor is one of the best investments.  
Ø A mistake is not where a stock price went down, or its good thing if it went up. These are an outcome. Process > Outcome.

Ø Not considering investment in China

comment,1g73jn4,,,,,,,lsnlzn9,techboyashish,"Hyundai's IPO is at Maruti's price. 

Hyundai's status is not even close with Maruti in India, it has only 1/3 market share. Maruti has many best seller models. But for Hundai only Creta and Venue are hits.  So it's not worth the price.

The second problem is that the entire IPO is OFS, not even a single rupee of Rs 25,000 crore will be spent on the growth of the company. 

All the money will be taken by the Korean promoters. Even after this OFS, 85% promoter holding will remain, which they will have to reduce by 10% in a year, for which they will have to bring FPO again at a cheaper price and this will not allow any good rise in the stock.",2024-10-19 08:01:42,4.0,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1g73jn4/whats_your_opinion_on_hyundai_ipo/,StockMarketIndia

post,1gbfyam,Managing ITM Long Options,AUM_0211,"Hello folks,

I am wondering what is a good way to take a short bet on stocks on NSE, and specifically how to manage ITM positions - assuming I am long PUTS. 

I am not looking to cap my profit potential so debit spreads, directional butterflies and other strategies are out of contention. I know they are better bets then naked options, but I want to make a case for managing Long ITM options. 

Now NSE expects physical settlement for ITM long PUTS if you let them expire, which requires a lot margin and even if you do have margin, it is not an efficient solution. So squaring off long option positions would make sense. 

But what if in a hypothetical scenario (and this is my main concern and reason for this post) market has a huge gap down and the ITM strike becomes illiquid and you can’t square it off, how do you manage this position? You made a killing but can’t get out and by expiry you would have lost on some profits too I believe! I have attached Maruti Option chain of ITM strikes. Clearly few strikes are not illiquid looking at the LTP.

Most logical solution I could think of was -

Lets say I wanted to take an initial position of long 70 delta ITM puts (avoiding ATM due to time value) with a short view. Instead I could short future (-100 delta) and long a 30 delta call of the same expiry, resulting in the same payoff as 70 delta puts. Here long calls will stay OTM in case of a huge drop, but would the futures become illiquid too due to high volatility?

Experts please comment!

Thanks! ",2024-10-24 23:02:41,1.0,0.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1gbfyam/managing_itm_long_options/,StockMarketIndia

I’m new to the stock market and would like your suggestions on whether I should apply for this IPO or not.
While researching Hyundai’s IPO I also checked out the stock price of their competitors and found the reason for their high valuation, But later when I checked out Tata Motors' share price I got to know that despite having a better valuation, revenue and profit their price is around 990 Rs, Whereas Maruti, M&M has a better price compared to it. What can be the reason? This means that Tata Motors has a lot more potential.",2024-10-09 06:43:49,0.0,1.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1fzlb68/what_do_you_think_about_hyundai_ipo/,StockMarketIndia

post,1g508fp,Hyundai IPO: The other side,NotAmbani,"Hello Everyone. I’ve been seeing a lot of chatter here about why you shouldn’t jump on the Hyundai India IPO, and while some points are valid, I want to share another side of the story. Not saying you should or shouldn't invest—**just clearing up some misconceptions and dropping some data to show you the other-side.**

**This IPO is not without problems I'm sure you must have seen problems on this sub already. THIS POST WILL LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE.**

# Hyundai India's PE Ratio Vs Hyundai Korea's PE Ratio

One common gripe is Hyundai India’s PE ratio is around 25 versus Hyundai Korea’s \~5. Yeah, that's true, but it misses the bigger picture. Check out these other companies:

|Indian Company|Indian Company's PE|Foreign Company|Foreign Company's PE|Ratio between PEs|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India Ltd|73|Nestle SA|19|3.84|
|Hindustan Unilever Ltd|63|Unilever PLC|22|2.86|
|Maruti Suzuki India Ltd|29|Suzuki Motor Corp|9.5|2.7|
|BASF India|54.5|BASF SE|12.5|4.36|
|GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited|70|GSK plc|15|4.66|

Notice a trend? Indian subsidiaries usually trade at a premium. It’s because India’s seen as a high-growth market, and the free float (how many shares are available for trading) is typically lower, pushing up the PE.

We can do the same comparing Revenue to Market cap also.

|Indian Company|Revenue (Billion USD)|Market Cap (Billion USD)|Foreign Company|Revenue (Billion USD)|Market Cap (Billion USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India Ltd|2.32|28.27|Nestle SA|111.03|250.50|
|Hindustan Unilever Ltd|7.35|77.84|Unilever plc|58.20|157.06|
|Maruti Suzuki India Ltd|16.56|46.38|Suzuki Motor Corp|36.60|19.87|
|BASF India|1.72|4.28|BASF SE|70.43|44.73|
|GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited|0.4|5.4|GSK plc|39.46|79.54|
|Hyundai India|8.3|19|Hyundai Motor Co|125.35|44.86|

This data honestly surprised me too. Suzuki Motor Corp holds 58% of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. This suggests that the rest of Suzuki Motor Corp is actually negatively valued. And yes the Revenue being more than the market cap for some companies is not a mistake. This just goes to show the discrepancy between the foreign and Indian share markets.

My point here is that the Indian company will **ALWAYS** seem overvalued compared to their foreign parents. Even if you were to dig deeper like I did with the Suzuki Example, you will realise that the market cap for the foreign company seems to be disproportionately coming from the Indian company which would be listed as an Asset on their books.

# Comparing PE/Valuation with Competition

|Company|Market Cap (Cr INR)|Revenue (Cr INR)|PE Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Maruti Suzuki|3,91,000|1,46,000|29.01|
|Mahindra and Mahindra|3,78,000|1,42,000|33.56|
|Tata Motors|3,37,000|4,44,000|10.75|
|Hyundai India|1,59,258|71,302|**\~26.5**|

So, the PE ratios for Hyundai India is actually less than Maruti and Mahindra. It's market cap to revenue ratio is also lower than Maruti and Mahindra. Tata motors is the exception here since they do operate in more sectors.

Now I know that you should not judge stocks solely based on PEs, but this provides a quick overview as to where Hyundai India stands. You and dig deep through their books and you will find that everything seems to be inline with their peers.

Even their Market Cap to Revenue is inline with Maruti and Mahindra.

# Index Inclusion: Why It Matters

Hyundai India is set to be included in major stock indexes (Nifty 100, Nifty 500, Possibly Nifty Next 50) within the next 6 months. Once it’s in the indexes, lots of passive funds will automatically buy it, increasing demand and potentially driving up the price.

At IPO, Hyundai India’s market cap will be similar to big players like Punjab National Bank or Adani Energy Solutions. Even 2-3% of shares going to index funds can mean around 10% of total free float shares getting snapped up. The actively managed funds will also want to buy Hyundai India since it’s now part of their benchmark Index, boosting demand even more.

# The Offer for Sale (OFS)

I have to say that the OFS offering has lead to some South Korean hate on this sub. This is insane and should not be happening. Hyundai came into India, set up a subsidiary, manufacturing and genuine created value. And even if their actions are ""Greedy"", that is just one company. It's insane to see this hate being directed at South Korea as a whole.

So what's exactly happening: Hyundai Korea is selling shares, not Hyundai India. They **claim** to need funds for R&D which happens at the Parent company while Hyundai India is only for Manufacturing. This IPO lets them get cash without Hyundai having to take on debt or dilute its equity.

**Hyundai Korea still holds a majority after the IPO, so they’re not just exiting.** They’re still invested and running the show, ensuring that the company has the backing it needs for future growth. They very much still have skin in the game. OFS is actually not that uncommon when you look at it. The Indian company's financials are healthy and it simply doesn't need a cash injection at this point.

# The Dividend

Pre-IPO dividends can sound sketchy, but they’re actually pretty common. Look at Indigo—they did the same thing. Hyundai India is using its generated cash to pay dividends, which should be factored into your valuation calculations. This can actually boost ROE by reducing excess equity, making the company look more efficient.

NB: Came across this research which explains in more detail why Pre-IPO dividend is not as bad as you think [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927538X23002664](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927538X23002664)

# The IPO will be undersubscribed

Well- Data suggests otherwise. The IPO is already over 40% subscribed. As of writing this post, DIIs (Domestic Mutual Funds and AMCs) have still NOT placed their Bids (They usually come in on the last day). The IPO has similar subscription to Paytm (and other IPOs this size) after 2 days. Given the trends in past IPO subscriptions, it is fair to assume this IPO will be full subscribed and may be oversubscribed by up to 2x.

Even if it doesn't hit 3-4x oversubscription, filling up the subscription is still a win, especially since Hyundai is raising a massive $3.3 billion USD.

(NB: If you want to check this data for yourself, head over to: [https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/issue-information?symbol=HYUNDAI&series=EQ&type=Active](https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/issue-information?symbol=HYUNDAI&series=EQ&type=Active) then click Bid details and select ""Consolidated Bids"". Make sure you are not only looking at the NSE Bids.)

# Grey Market Premium (GMP)

Even though GMP has dropped, it never went below zero. It has always stayed a premium and never became a discount. This shows steady interest and suggests the IPO is priced fairly—not overpriced or underpriced.

Unlike many IPOs that rely on discounts to attract buyers, Hyundai’s valuation means the listing price should align closely with the offer price, reflecting true value. If you only apply to IPOs for listing gains- This isn't an IPO for you.

# A side note

One of the biggest issues with the Indian stock market is that the Breath of the market is not increasing as fast as the Depth. More and more capital is pouring in but the number of large companies isn't increasing at the same speed. Given the IPOs that have been coming out at such a huge discount recently all giving amazing listing gains, I could imagine why this is a turn off that Hyundai decided to list themselves at fair market value. But IPOs aren't meant for a listing gain. They are to take a company public, which this one seems to be successful in doing.

# --- Edit ---

**Appreciate all the feedback. Someone even texted me and called me Mr. Hyundai Man which I found hilarious. A few common points I missed seem to be brought up by multiple people, so I wanted to address these.**

# The Royalty

So, yes. There is a Royalty.

But guess what? Every foreign company with an Indian subsidiary does this. Why? Are they trying to loot India? No. This is the payment for maintaining the brand. Any spend Hyundai Korea does to polish the Hyundai brand benefits Hyundai India and this is the payment for that. The royalty is capped at 5%. This isn't anything insane and many other MNCs - including Toyota India (which is currently private), Bosch, Schaeffler India and Wabco India - pay royalty payments to their parent companies. A couple interesting ones are:

|Company|Cap on Royalty to Parent for Brand|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India|4.5%|They tried to increase it recently but the shareholders rejected the resolution.|
|Maruti Suzuki|5%||

Now, the Cap doesn't always mean this much money will be payed out. In FY23, Maruti paid 3.75% royalty to Suzuki motors. At one point in time, the royalty used to be above 6-6.5% before coming down to the 5% cap now in place. So, I ask you this-

**If Maruti Suzuki has a 5% royalty, why is Hyundai India's 5% not justified? I would argue that ""Maruti"" has a brand value within India which may be sustainable without Suzuki. Hyundai is Hyundai and without the name, it has no alternative.**

Hyundai India benefits much more from this royalty deal than Maruti Suzuki does. Yet for some reason, people think Hyundai is ""Greedy"" and Suzuki are Saints.

# Mini IPO? 75% promoter shareholding rule

Someone in the comments said ""the parent company has to offload an additional 7.5% stake in the coming six months to reach the max 75% promoter holding"". This is partly true that 7.5% additional stake needs to be offloaded but not in the next 6 months. This will take place in 3-5 years ([Source](https://www.autocarpro.in/news/hyundai-india-to-dilute-75-additional-stake-in-3-5-years-122999)). This would be 1-2% additional free float every year something the markets can easily handle while increasing liquidity for the stock (speculation alert) potentially propelling Hyundai India into the F&O Category.

It is in **Hyundai's best interest to do this as slowly as possible too**. If they were to crash the price of the Indian subsidiary, Hyundai Korea's books would show fewer assets. To keep their own book inflated, they will make sure this happens responsibly. **They aren't selling and running away, they will still own 75% of the company.**

# So you are actually saying Hyundai India is a Buy?

Absolutely NOT. The purpose of this post is not to tell you to buy or not. It was to show the facts. The decision to BUY is yours. People seemed to have reached the conclusion that Hyundai is Bad with incomplete facts.

It is funny how people have a problem with things from Royalty to Valuation. Funny part is, from the looks of it, Hyundai India tried to copy Maruti Suzuki. And this makes sense! They are following a very similar business model here. In fact, Suzuki Motors is much worse of without Maruti Suzuki compared to Hyundai Korea without Hyundai India.

comment,1g508fp,,,,,,,ls8aola,NotAmbani,"Good question.

Index rebalancing happens twice a year. Let's stick to NSE's indexes for now. The cut-off date is January 31 and July 31 of each year, HOWEVER, the effective date of change last working day of March and September.

So Hyundai will be locked in the Index list on January 31 but the buying will take place on the last working day of march. Hyundai will rank \~80 on the exchange. This will **not** be enough to get into Nifty 50 but should be enough to get the stock into Nifty 100, Nifty Next 50, Nifty LargeMidcap 250, Nifty 500 and Nifty Total Market. Based on the rough estimate from [indiapassivefunds.com](http://indiapassivefunds.com) and % holdings in similar market cap stocks, I can say that 10% of the free float (\~$400 Million) of stock would be bought into these Index funds by March.

The DIIs and FIIs most likely have factored this in. Something most retail investors are oblivious to. When Index funds are forced to buy Hyundai, it will see massive buying pressure and these shares will have to come from somewhere.",2024-10-16 17:18:11,19.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1g508fp/hyundai_ipo_the_other_side/,IndianStreetBets

post,1fvt6o6,Becoming Arjun: Aiming Droneacharya (DD),Lift_Kara_De,"It’s been a moment since I posted a new DD. Primarily because of 2 reasons:

1. I generally take a step back from actively investing when big numbers are hit on my profile to let my mind just acclimatize to the big numbers (see previous post on E2E Networks)
2. Trying to build an IT business which is a big financial and mental investment 

I am here now. Let’s go!

# Background

I looked into Drone tech a few years back, fascinated by them since college but didn’t have the budget to build it as a project back then. I saw startups and funding go into this field and die due to the strictness (more like strangulation) by the gov. I was recently informed by a fellow redditor u/ritzy1107, that those regulations have eased and I jumped into the research.

There are some serious tailwinds to the industry primarily blown by the gov. to promote drone tech in India.

[https://www.cioinsiderindia.com/tech-buzz/india-s-new-drone-rules-could-tailwind-the-industry-tbid-3267.html](https://www.cioinsiderindia.com/tech-buzz/india-s-new-drone-rules-could-tailwind-the-industry-tbid-3267.html)

[https://www.ey.com/en\_in/insights/government-public-sector/how-india-can-become-the-drone-hub-of-the-world-by-2030](https://www.ey.com/en_in/insights/government-public-sector/how-india-can-become-the-drone-hub-of-the-world-by-2030)

[https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/businesses-govt-propel-indias-fledging-drone-industry/106251](https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/businesses-govt-propel-indias-fledging-drone-industry/106251)

[https://www.maple-advisors.com/Drone\_Report\_Maple\_Capital\_Advisors\_PHDCCI.pdf](https://www.maple-advisors.com/Drone_Report_Maple_Capital_Advisors_PHDCCI.pdf)

I am pretty critical of governments as general rule but here they really made the right choice here, even though this is a security sensitive industry, given its use of airspace. The gov. went for a high trust policy implementation rather than low trust one. What this means is, first there was blanket ban on drones (only military and case-by-case basis was allowed). Then when the gov. decided to open it up, instead of slowly opening it up over a decade and playing catch up with the rest of the world, the policy was lenient from the start. I think this is to strongly incentivize entrepreneurs to jump into the Akhada. From now, as violations/abuse happen, they will tighten up the policy over time allowing the policy regulation to reach equilibrium faster without smothering industry.

Furthermore, they also create several drone programs and PLI schemes to actively support/promote drone tech in India. Summary: [https://mpowerlithium.com/blogs/blog/top-government-schemes-that-support-rd-in-drone-technology-to-further-innovation](https://mpowerlithium.com/blogs/blog/top-government-schemes-that-support-rd-in-drone-technology-to-further-innovation)

# Company

The company started off as a training institute for drone pilots and got registered as a Drone RPTO under DGCA. There are 25 other organizations who are licensed as well. Due to the sheet number of potential drone pilots required (1 million over the next few years), the company started training and certifying individuals for the same. I am wary of this high number and personally not very optimistic about this business. However, this is just how the company started.

Then the company thought to start capturing value.

They started taking on Service Projects. This included doing surveys and consultation. This business further started growing as the skilled labor in the field is hard to come by currently. This was the point of the IPO. The company with its raised money has setup a manufacturing unit in Pune along with 3^(rd) party companies. The founder openly conceded that they want to have everything in-house but given the company’s size and nascency of the industry in India, collaboration is the way to go. I agree.

To be able to quickly serve several services and many use cases while establishing itself as a “more mature” brand, the company started acquiring other companies and grow inorganically. For example, the FPV (First Person View) drone they launched was actually a acquired subsidiary product PYI Technologies in which they acquired 51%.

What I really find fascinating about the company is its clarity and focus on military/security implications. Given the borders we have, geopolitical stage, increasing military spending (50% increase since 2020), armed forces are going to require s\*\*t ton of the stuff and preferably made in India. It also might be useful in short to mid-term with escalating tensions on all fronts and away borders.

What I understand is the government wants this industry to take off as soon as possible and these guys are on top of it. This is known by the 120 crore PLI at 20% rate started in 2021. This year, there’s consideration for [PLI of up to 3000 cr](https://www.livemint.com/industry/india-mulls-3000-cr-incentives-to-develop-drone-ecosystem-pli-scheme-production-linked-incentive-central-government-11726482666125.html).

Now, one possible concern I got was, what if all this is just hype and the company isn’t really building/delivering/serving all of these things? But then looking at the past 10 months filing in exchange, they are actually getting orders from where it matters. In north-east, they delivered FPV drones with night vision capability, other government and armed forces, forest, some ancient civilization mapping in Gujarat. They are actually getting contracts (albeit small contracts).

The proof for quality of work for me was the 2 contracts, one from Qatar for drones and second from UK for data processing. This makes me believe they have quality of service and product to be provided. While writing this, the company announced collab with an American company American Blast Systems(ABS) which is in the defense sector in US but does not have drones in products to cross sell the drones while Droneacharya will cross sell their products in Asia.

Further, I think they’ve taken up something that other non-technical industries might require, that is data processing. This was mentioned in an interview as well. This allows a company in another industry to use data capabilities along with processing and analysis. When thrown in with the manufacturing/customization, this will capture the most value in the value chain within the company. 1. Consulting  2. Sell/Rent drone 3. Execute Survey/Mapping 4. Analyze Data. This makes it a solution provider and not just a drone manufacturer.

This brings me to the immediate competitors: IdeaForge and Drone Destinations.

IdeaForge is in the manufacturing side which is a good business but asset heavy and I don’t imagine will retain high margin in the long term. From what I understand drone are not technically challenging to manufacture. The software is the part which is a tad bit complicated but the tech is easily available all over the world. Also, the company is larger than what I would like in m-cap.

Drone Destination sits a little closed to this company. However, they are not aggressively expanding and are providing the vanilla set of services that any drone provider can give and nothing on the site about armed forces use, which to my mind is important. Just think of the scale at which US military complex works and India position geo-politically and geographically, makes it extremely important for me.

# Management Lineup

This is where the company really shines. The founder has a master in GIS systems, their father who’s consulting for the company has almost fictional profile (see concerns section). They have ex-defense, forestry experts with decades of experience to navigate the complex regulatory and business development environment which I imagine defense is.

# Concerns

1. Receivables are **very** high. This is one thing that’s objectively wrong in the company. The reason I can draw is gov. is a bad paymaster, always has been, there are cases where it works well (HAL). This is not exceptional to this company as Drone Destination also has the same issue. So, I either drop this or swallow the pill. Would love to grill them as a big chunk is in 1-2 year bucket.
2. Founder/CEO’s remuneration is high: 1 cr. for the founder and 32 lakhs for his wife CFO.
3. Founder/CEO’s father remuneration: Received 25 lakhs for consultation fee. I got alarmed with this but then saw his bio. Kind of justified with the surreal experience and profile but still steep. Would have liked more pragmatic compensation for all:

>Dr. Pradeep K Srivastava is a senior expert in the domain of Remote Sensing from far and near. He is MS in Applied mathematics and PhD in Theoretical Mechanics and Control Systems from Friendship University, Moscow. He has spend more than thirty years in the service of Indian Space Research Organization in different capacities. During his tenure in ISRO he was responsible for design, development and realization of algorithms and software for processing of Space borne Earth and Planetary observation, Meteorological, Oceanographical data acquired by Indian Space missions. One of his contributions has resulted in the Processing of Cartosat-1 stereo imagery to produce CartoDEM, a high resolution Earth's surface model from ISRO. Dr. Srivastava has made major contributions in theory and practice of Satellite Photogrammetry as a discipline. He has published more than 60 papers and reports on the subject. On retiring from ISRO in 2014 as Outstanding Scientist he has been active as Sr advisor in Karnataka State Department of Information Technology. He has contributed in establishing Karnataka-GIS, a flagship project of Govt. of Karnataka as its Chief Technical Officer. He pursues his academic and research interests as Adjunct Professor, IIT Gandhinagar and Adjunct Professor at NIAS, Bangalore. Dr Srivastava gives courses on 'Satellite Photogrammetry"". Terrain Modeling and Analysis, 'Terrain modeling using data from Unmanned aerial vehicles' and of late ' Space based systems for Positioning and Navigation. Kind of justified with the surreal experience and profille but still steep. Would have liked more pragmatic compensation for all.Kind of justified with the surreal experience and profille but still steep. Would have liked more pragmatic compensation for all.

4. Low Governance and low accounting standards: Some sanitary stuff is not well done. The company car is not transferred to company name. It’s a Maruti Ertiga with 10 lakhs, not a big deal but still. Inventory valuations is not done. All this stuff is expected in small operations for a company working to survive.

5. Income tax dispute with I-T dept worth 5 crore. Not a existential crisis but can be incredibly bad.

6. Intangible Assets value is not clear on its valuation as outlines in the independent auditor’s remarks.

# Conclusions

If the company delivers on the tie-ups and initial contracts they are doing while reigning in the receivables, we are going places. If not, then we're f\*\*\*ed. I have bought 3 lots (3000 shares of the stock).

3. They only publish full year results I believe.

My two cents:  
  
MD is the son of ISRO scientists.

Founder has studied GIC

Sector is in gov focus and has good tailwinds

This fits the category of small in size and huge in opportunity 

The Company has guided for 200% growth for next 3 years in recent NDTV interview and filing

In 2022 when company’s revenue was 3.5 crs they guided for 50-60 crs revenue for FY24 and did 35 crs. So we should take it conservatively what they can do in future. Also they set target of 1000 crs revenue by FY27. I feel they will do excellent for next few years. 200% looks aggressive but I feel they will grow above 100% for next few years. 

Valuations look reasonable after good fall in price.

post,1fyqvio,Why Ola deserves hate.,Batman_In_Peacetime,"I originally meant to put it as a comment on that recent post, but decided to make it a post in itself.

The way I see it, **Ola deserves hate.** They're not just another startup trying to make people's lives slightly better.

1. They're in an industry that can't tolerate failures, cause when it happens people die.
2. They're using government FAME II subsidy to sell their products. Which means that they're using tax payer money.

**Why can't people just not buy their product?**

People want to save money. If I claim to sell a new bike at 50k, promising the same features as the 80k bike - people will buy it. They trust a vehicle to have undergone government regulated checks. There's a reason government regulations and strict quality control (QC)exist.

**How does Ola hurt the good players in EV market?**

I feel that if they weren't here, other promising startups like Ather would be more popular. Ather has been growing steadily, it has been launched all over India with largely positive results.

**What's stopping other start-ups/companies to sell cheap EVs?**

Their own principles. They care about people's lives, and thus do good QC - which evidently costs money. Look at Ather again. Look at Bajaj chetak. Ather chooses to sell their products a bit more expensive over Ola, knowing well that it'll hurt their sales. And they don't have a humongous marketing budget like Ola.

Ola has the money. They just don't use the money on QC.

**Let's compare it with Tesla EV cars in the USA.**  
(Bhavin would be happy being compared to Elon, lol).

You might see a pattern here -

1. Tesla made huge promises and under delivered them. Their cars have less range then promised, and are more expensive than promised.
2. Tesla product quality is shit. Quality Control is non existent. When customers complain (or die in Tesla crashes), Tesla bullies them in law suits.
3. Tesla pays a ton on marketing and PR, ensuring the tarnished brand image is flooded with posts of praise. Most of that is fake/false.
4. Tesla stock is over valued due to Elon's illegal manipulation. And illegal Bitcoin trading. Pump and dump schemes. That's how he makes money. Remember the Tesla 420 tweet and the following stock appreciation? That was termed illegal by SEC in the USA.

Bhavin has done the first two. He's on his way to three - bashing genuine people via his Twitter account, ensuring PR posts 10x for every negative comment. What remains is to manipulate Ola stock and make money by pump and dump. With the recent OLAELEC downfall, maybe that has already begun.

You see, I don't care about the pump and dump. Play with your own company stock however you want to.

But don't leverage people's lives to play your money game. That's criminal.

Edit: To answer a comment question- **Why do people buy shit despite so many negative reviews?**

People want to save money. Aggressive marketing techniques by Ola helps. OLA literally hired Byju's sales staff. I have evidence in my tier 3 town, consider the same for a big city.

To understand their perspective, think of it from the angle of a normal consumer in the Indian vehicle landscape. 

1. There has been NO vehicle ever launched in India with such bad reliability over and over again, with no product recall. Ever since 1991. Try to think of one.
2. Most vehicles introduced in India have already been tried and tested in the Western world - be it USA (luxury cars), or EU (cheaper models like Pinto, Alto). This means that vehicles have been tried and tested already.
3. The oldest vehicles - Ambassador, Bajaj Chetak (*Hamara Bajaj*) had such high ratings for reliability, that it made the factor of 'trust' easier for all future vehicles.

What this implies, is that **Indian consumer is care free about a vehicle's reliability.** They trust that it won't fall apart like a bicycle. **So,** they focus on other stuff that matters - mileage (kitna deti hai?), durability, service costs etc.

Once a bad product launches, people learn and adapt.

\*\*\* Note -

1. When I say reliability, I mean a vehicle working as intended/as promised. I have not considered the low safety ratings of Maruti here. (X-Presso has a 0 star ratings, Maruti are you f\*\*\*ing kidding me).

post,1e1bldn,Never sell your winners.,lotus_eater_rat,"I moved to Pune in 2018 and lived near the Persistent System office. I used to pass through their building, and It may sound funny but one of the reasons to check the company was because I liked their office names. I started investing in the PPFAS mutual fund and the persistent system was one of the top holdings. I bought shares worth 45K in 2018. Sold 1/3rd in 2021 and again in 2022 to get advantage of 1 lakh LTCG tax-expectation. Also bought TATA elixir during the same period and sold it when it became 2X.

I did make some money but after seeing the further growth I promised myself that I would never sell  
unless there is something seriously wrong with the companies I am holding. Have not sold a single stock since March 2022, Remaining 15k of the persistent system is now 2.60 lakhs (17X) in 6 years. I have HDFC Bank, ITC, Persistent System, Arman Finance, Maruti, Titan, ICICI Bank, TCS, and NMDC in my portfolio.

I know my XIRR (22%) may not be impressive in today’s scenario but I would suggest don’t sell your  
winner for a small gain. If you are holding good companies, there is potential it could be 25X or 50X in the long term. Also, think what difference it will make to your wealth if u even make 5k in 6 months on a 10k investment. It will surely make a difference if u make 2.5 lakh from 10k.

comment,1i10s6l,,,,,,,m72larr,naseemashraf,"\> There is literally only one solution which is stop buying foreign products and start selling our products to them.

In theory. Reality is far too difficult.

But first, take a look at our imports. [https://tradingeconomics.com/india/imports-by-category](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/imports-by-category)

The solution to increasing Indian exports of products/services requires increasing imports (fuel, technology, etc.). 

The primary problem for trade deficit is energy and technology. If better/more non fossil fuel based energy generation and utilization is pursued, it will drastically reduce the trade deficit. Imho, a superpower is one that doesn't rely on external energy resources. This must be step 1.

India's current positive but slow progress in trade and economic partnership with OPEC countries and BRIC initiatives can soften the harsh fuel/energy requirements. Still, a full transition to non-fossil fuels is the need of the hour.

Some quick fixes to reducing fossil fuel import for **transport** would be;  
1. Increasing communication/wfh/remote work to reduce the need for individual travel/transport  
2. Rebuilding infra and cities towards ""15-minute cities""; Having aped the west we have build crap cities that have spread out farther/wider rather than going denser/vertical.  
3. Better public transport using non-fossil fuel energy sources.  
4. Massive self sustaining neighborhoods and somewhat soviet style mass housing projects (ofcourse needing the fix of the several issues it had/has).

SJS Enterprises (SJS) is one of the leading players in decorative aesthetics Industry catering to 2Ws (34%), PVs (40%) and consumer appliance segments(21%) and others (FMCG, Sanitaryware, Healthcare, Telecom, EMS) (5%). Market size of Decorative Aesthetics is ~2000 crores, whereas for exports it is closer to ~22000 crores.

Prior to 2021, the company was primarily a decorative printing brand. Post acquistion of Exotech and Walter Pack the company has built capabilities in chrome plating and IML/ IMD and IME’s.




What does SJS do ? 

SJS produces decals, logos, 2D appliques and domes to advanced products such as 3D lux logos/badges, 3D appliques, lens, mask assemblies, optical plastics, IMEs and IMLs/IMDs. 



In 2 Wheelers, the company’s bulk of revenues comes from Logo’s, Badges and Body Graphics. 

Key customers in 2 wheelers are TVS, Honda, Bajaj, Royal Enfield, Yamaha and Ola. 

Let’s take an example of a legacy Bajaj Pulsar 150 CC bike and what can SJS manufacture for Pulsar 150 

Bajaj and Pulsar Logo on the body of the bike

Decals including 150 written on the front and the back along with decals on headlight and rims.

Bajaj logo on Engine.





Along with the above example, SJS has introduced newer generation and future ready products  for 2W as seen below.





Currently content per vehicle in 2W is  300-500 rupees. 

The key new and future innovations driving increase in content per vehicle in 2W 

3D Speedometers replacing 2D Speedometer & Cover glass for digital screens in 2W. Depending on adoption content per vehicle may increase to 450-1000 rupees a vehicle.



However, important thing to note is 2 W are constrained by size and there is only limited scope of how much a company can innovate and increase content per vehicle as 2W size has remained constant for decades.

With SJS having a very healthy share in 2W and especially bikes, growth in 2W is broadly led by underlying 2W volume growth. 





Passenger vehicles - 

Passenger vehicles have seen a big shift to SUV’s from Hatchbacks and Sedans. We wrote about the Passenger Vehicles Industry to check out what’s driving and who are the beneficiaries. 

Larger the car, leaves more room for aesthetics resulting in disproportionate growth for decorative aesthetics player like SJS.

In 4 wheelers the company supplies to Mahindra, Maruti , Tata, Kia, Hyundai, Morris Garage, Volkswagen, Skoda India and Stellantis. 

In fact Mahindra is the largest client of the company contributing ~14-15% of revenues.

Let’s take Mahindra XUV 700 and see what SJS can manufacture - 

On the exterior - 

Front side SJS can manufacture the logo along with the chrome plating 

On the back-side, Logo’s along with model and rear badges such as XUV 700 and AX7 



On the interior side - 

SJS can manufacture logos and illuminated logos on steering wheel

In-mold decoration

3D Appliques 

Cover glass on screen



Below is the complete portfolio of SJS in PV - 





As seen just by sheer components, PV is a much more exciting market for SJS. Current kit value for a PV is ~INR 2400-3000 per vehicle, though future kit value can increase materially to ~INR 7000-12000 per vehicle which makes PV key driver for growth for the company.



Consumer Discretionary and Others - 

The company manufactures primarily logos and chrome plating for Consumer Discretionary companies.



Key customers in Consumer Goods include Whirlpool (Global), Samsung, Godrej, Eureka Forbes, Legrand

The company also provides logo’s, decals and other decorative aesthetics to EMS, Telecom, Sanitaryware and FMCG companies.

EMS / Telecomm - Dixon, Syrma, Neolync, Seoyon, Wangda, Optiemus.

Sanitaryware, FMCG, others – RIL, Sensacore, Geberit, Roca, Litemed.



How has company fared in 9M FY25 - 

The company has grown slightly slower than 2W industry owing to a higher bike mix which has grown slower.

In PV’s the company has grown at 38% v/s 3% for the industry resulting in ~24% volume growth for SJS v’s 11.2% for the Industry





What can drive growth for SJS Enterprises - 

Increase in SUV market share and increase in content per vehicle

The company has committed capex of ~170-180 crores of capex over next 2 years primarily in increasing capacities in Exotech (~80 crores) and Cover glass (~40 crores)

Exotech is currently running at 95% utilization, hence incremental capacities should be utilized swiftly.

In cover glass, the company will make the cover glass that comes on top of display screen, which give you some very special properties like anti-reflection, anti-glare, antifingerprint. Cover glass can be a big opportunity roughly from maybe Rs.700 a vehicle to close to about Rs.4,000 a vehicle

Increasing Pie of exports from 7% to 13-15% in next 2-3 years



Key Risks - 

 Labour Issues - SJS has had a major strike in 2024 with workers complaining on poor working condition and wrongful termination, both fairly serious concerns.

Material Slowdown in anchor clients -

Mahindra and TVS have been amongst the top anchor clients for SJS Enterprises and they continue to outperform their respective markets. However, any change in the above scenario will h

Failure to Innovate - 

Innovation and acceptance is the backbone in decorative aesthetics segment, and the segment has the highest disruption amongst ancillary players.



Conclusion - Broadly SJS stands in a sweet spot where market size is small and fast growing, there is no EV risk and is amongst the key beneficiaries in the premiumization trend.

post,1kcshql,Top 10 Market-Moving News for Indian Stocks - 2025-05-02,ecofaille,"Here's a summary of the most important news impacting Indian publicly listed companies today:

1.  **NMDC:** Revised iron ore prices effective May 1, 2025. Baila Lump (65.5%) is now ₹6,440/ton and Baila Fines (64%) are ₹5,500/ton. These price changes will directly impact NMDC's revenue and profitability.

2.  **Wardwizard Innovations & Mobility:** Q4FY25 EBITDA surged by 62% YoY, despite a slight dip in total revenue. The company is expanding its electric fleet and has a $1.29 billion EV partnership in the Philippines.

3.  **Power & Instrumentation (Gujarat):** Celebrates 50th anniversary and secures its first 400 kV EHV transmission order, opening doors to high-voltage infrastructure projects and promising increased revenue.

4.  **Escorts Kubota:** Agri Machinery sales slightly down in April 2025 due to preponement of festive season demand, but export tractor sales surged by 67.4%. Construction Equipment Business faced headwinds due to cost escalation.

5.  **Capri Global Capital:** Credit rating for Commercial Paper withdrawn, but Non-Convertible Debenture limit enhanced from ₹150 crore to ₹550 crore. This could positively affect the company's fundamentals by increasing available capital through debentures.

6.  **Eicher Motors:** VE Commercial Vehicles reports a 27.3% increase in sales in April 2025, driven by strong domestic performance. Eicher Motors' international business demonstrated remarkable growth, with sales increasing by 55%.

7.  **TVS Motor Company:** Sales up 16% in April 2025, driven by strong performance across various segments, including a 59% surge in electric vehicle sales and 45% increase in exports.

8.  **Infosys:** Completed acquisition of MRE Consulting, enhancing its capabilities in energy and commodity trading and risk management (E/CTRM).

9.  **JSW Energy:** JSW Neo Energy secures a 40-year Pumped Hydro Storage Power Procurement Agreement (PHSPPA) with Uttar Pradesh for 1,500 MW / 12,000 MWh, locking in revenue for the next 40 years.

10. **Maruti Suzuki:** April 2025 sales increased overall, but mini segment sales declined significantly. Utility vehicles and compact segment sales increased. These sales numbers definitely affect the fundamentals of the company since the revenue is directly proportional to the sales.

post,1g71whz,Hyundai Motor Company IPO,theperfectlap,"So guys. I thought of making this post, which is going to sound pretty bold with some bold predictions.

To begin with Hyundai IPO was heavily ignored by the retail and non-institutional investors.

Even I ignored it, but after applying for it. I applied for the IPO at pre open. However, after reading all the negative outlook on the IPO I decided to not authorise the UPI mandate and let it go.

However, on the last day, I thought of just analysing the RHP.

HyMC is definitely selling about 22% of the company to public. They are going to take that money and don't know what they will do with it. It's an OFS.

However, 

- The promoters are still going to retain more than 80% of the company. Which is a positive a big positive, keeping in mind a lot of good listed companies don't have more than 30% promoter holdings.

- Hyundai is the 2nd largest Auto manufacturer, with respect to sales figures.

- They are doing very well and growing in the right direction Globally, having tackled every possible challenge with grit and determination over the years. This is a specimen of their brilliant top management. Which is a key indicator of an investible company for me.

- Sales of HyMC stood around 7L units compared to Maruti which was at 20L. Maruti's stock is trading at ~12k. HyMC will be issued at around 1960. Although not the best ratios to create an analogy using. But I see a scope for HyMC stock to double or even triple in the coming years.

- Institutional investors have poured in their moolah and oversubscribed the IPO. There is a positive interest among the FIIs and DIIs. On listing day and even after that IIs are going to pour in more funds, and they pour in big. This will drive volume, and pull in the Retail and NIIs into the game, even the ones who stayed away from the IPO subscription.

- Overall, I feel Retail and NIIs were a victim of market sentiments, as always and have allowed for a good opportunity to slip past. However, there is still a good chance to buy it on listing day. In fact it will be available for a discount, in all of it's likliness. 

- The opportunists, will sure be waiting with their order at 10:00 IST on listing day. 😬

In this environment, why take a bet on a company that doesn't have a clear idea what it's parent entity would do with the money raised from the bourses? The India operation CEO/MD said on CNBC that they require more investment for capex (so further fundraising potentially required through a QIP), and has also highlighted the sales growth at 5-ish %, tops.

post,1g5m4at,Hyundai IPO last-minute TLDR,Lazy-Transition8236,"Keeping this short.

The GMP is now around 1% of the IPO band price, so you would have an idea of what to do in this IPO.

Now coming to the long-term perspective instead of IPO:

1. Good market share and largest exporter of passenger cars from India.
2. Potential to benefit from growing car ownership in India
3. Car sales down in the short-term and if profitability is managed well, Hyundai Motors can grow well in the long-term.
4. Increasing net-profits and revenue.
5. Royalty to parent company up from 2% to 3.5%. Comparing Hyundai to Maruti Suzuki in this aspect is not a good idea since Maruti can de-merge from their parent company and still do well.

Reasons to wait until listing and to NOT apply for IPO:

1. GMP down really bad and the listing will happen at a discounted price.
2. Even if the listing happens at a good premium, by some miracle, the IPO size is huge and the selloff to book profits will be MASSIVE leading to the share price coming down and being volatile.

post,1g3lmml,Hyundai IPO views ,Primary-Item4727,"Let's discuss some points for the ipo to discuss 


Q)why is the GMP so low.

I believe that the ipo is very big, a 27000 crore and due to which allotment to everyone is quite possible hence no GMP.


Q) long term perspective 

The company is among the top three auto manufacturers and would be included in almost 90% of the indexes like nifty auto, largecaps, and possibly in nifty 50 or next 50 as well hence inflows of the retailers sip inflows. 


Q) are valuations high

I would say that the valuations are reasonable, not low but not so high. Valuations are at par with maruti suzuki but its market share isn't. The valuations could have been better.

comment,1g3lmml,,,,,,,lrxgx7y,Asteroid06,"That's probably the most regarded take on the Hyundai IPO controversy I've seen so far. Only go for the IPO if you're a long term investor and are comfortable with the valuations and optimistic on hyundai's growth story. There is going to be next to nil listing gains since the Ipo is overvalued and supply is large, selling on listing might net you net loss post transaction fees. Either hold all, or don't apply to IPO.

For short term investors it might be better to wait and watch how it pans out before investing, there is a chance it may dip below issue price in the weeks following listing for a while. If it does list with a gain it's not gonna be more than 5% , so for short term investors the risk reward isn't favourable",2024-10-14 20:05:15,6.0,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1g3lmml/hyundai_ipo_views/,IndianStreetBets

5. Points to consider



**Business**  
  
Hyundai Motor India (HMI) is a part of the Hyundai Motor Co (HMC) Group, **third largest auto OEM in the world in CY2023 and 2nd largest domestic auto OEM in the Indian passenger vehicles market** according to the CRISIL Report, operate through 13 vehicle models. **They are the largest exporter of PV from India**. HMI contributed 18% of HMC's global sales in CY 23. They aim to become an export hub for HMC for exports to emerging markets including South Asia, Latin America, Africa and Middle East through 82 international distributors.  
  
**Hyundai operates through Chennai plant having annual capacity of 8,24,000 as on FY24.** 90% of parts are localized, procured from India. New plant at Talegaon is coming up by FY26 which will increase capacity to 994,000 units and when fully operational 1,074,000 units. Hyundai derives its competitive strength in R&D and exports from capabilities of HMC.  
  
Hyundai also has pre-owned car program under “Hyundai Promise”, through which Hyundai passenger vehicles that are up to 10 years old can be certified and backed by warranties to facilitate resale.  
Hyundai provides warranty of 3 years or 1 lakh kms.  
  
**Products**  
  
Hyundai has 13 models across vehicle segments  
  
**Sedans**  
-Aura( Petrol/ Petrol, CNG)  
-Verna  
  
**Hatchbacks**  
-Grand i10 NIOS ( Petrol/ Petrol, CNG)  
- i20  
-i20 N Line  
  
**SUVs**

**Industry overview**  
  
  
The Global PV sales in CY2023 was dominated by Toyota Group at 11.1 million, followed by Volkswagen Group with 9.2 million units and Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai + Kia) with 7.3 million units, with **Hyundai group being 3rd largest global passenger vehicle ( PV) maker.**  
  
**According to CRISIL MI&A, India had 26 cars per 1,000 people as of Fiscal 2024.** Although the penetration grew from 22 cars per 1000 people in Fiscals 2019 to 26 cars as of Fiscal 2024, it is significantly lower than the developed nations and even emerging nations like Brazil, Russia, and Mexico. This provides significant headroom for growth, especially given the expected increase in disposable incomes, faster economic growth, younger population, and increased focus from international OEMs.  
  
As per CRISIL MI&A, Indian economy is expected to surpass US$5 trillion mark over the next seven fiscals (2025- 2031) and inching closer to US$7 trillion. A projected average GDP growth of 6.7% in this period will make India the third-largest economy in the world and lift per capita income to the upper middle-income category. **By Fiscal 2031, India’s per capita income will rise to approximately US$4,500, thereby making it an upper middle-income nation.**  
  
Between FY19 and FY24 , India’s domestic PV sales volume rose at 5% CAGR. This growth was despite the sales contraction (at 10% CAGR) witnessed during Fiscals 2019 to 2021. Sales were 3.9 million vehicles in Fiscal 2023. **CRISIL MI&A expects the industry to clock 4.5-6.5% CAGR between FY24 to FY29 period to reach 5.2-5.7 million domestic vehicle sales.**  
  
**Premiumization trend in Cars**

B/w FY21 and FY23 , car industry by value increased by 36% due to- premiumization- preference of SUVs- increase in prices due to emission norms-raw material price hike

**ASP( Avg selling price) rose from 491000rs to 659000rs b/w FY19 and FY23.**  
  
**Segment share of SUVs rose from 23% to 50% in FY24 at 23% CAGR.** Recognizing the changing consumer preferences, OEMs also launched higher number of vehicles in the SUV segment. The mid-size SUV segment (24% CAGR) outpaced the entire SUV segment. Continued traction for the high selling models like Hyundai Creta & Kia Seltos as well as Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara, Toyota Urban cruiser Hyryder, and Honda Elevate provided the thrust to the growth of mid-size SUVs. **The share of small cars (hatchbacks) reduced from 46.9% in Fiscal 2019 to 34.4% in Fiscal 2023.**  
  
The hatchbacks segment lost market share owing to  
- lack of new model launches  
-frequent hikes in vehicle prices  
-increase in operating costs amid fuel price hikes  
-an unfavourable macroeconomic environment that impacted the price sensitive entry-level customer base  
  
  
Domestic PV industry is an oligopolistic market with few players dominating the entire industry. Maruti Suzuki is the market leader ,Hyundai Motor India second largest contributor to the domestic sales, followed by Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra. These 4 players together contribute approximately 80% of the market.

**Operating metrics**  
  
Hyundai has sold following number of cars in FY24-  
ICE 506,250  
CNG 60,320  
EV 975  
  
Hyundai has lost some share in the hatchbacks segment in the last 5 years. Discontinuation of its compact hatchbacks Santro and Eon impacted the company’s share within the hatchbacks segment. Intensified competition with entry of new models Tata Altroz and Toyota Glanza in the premium hatchbacks segment exerted pressure on its share in the premium hatchbacks sub-segment in the last 5 years.  
  
In the compact sedans segment, Maruti Suzuki leads with a market share of approximately 58.5%, from the Dzire model. **Following Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai holds a share of around 19.8%, attributed to Aura model.** **In the premium sedans segment, Hyundai Motor India dominates with a 31.2% market share**, driven by sale of its only model Verna.  
  
Compared to other segments, the SUV segment is much more fragmented with no clear leader and very close competition between the OEMs. Hyundai dominates the mid-size SUV sub segment. **With its flagship model Creta, Hyundai commanded a leading 30% market share.**  
  
**Hyundai has more than 1,350 sales touchpoints across India.** Maruti Suzuki has about 3,250 touchpoints in India. **Hyundai has 1500 service touchpoints**, while Maruti has 4,560 service touchpoints. In terms of sales+ service touchpoints, Hyundai is 2nd largest after Maruti.  
  
Maruti leads the industry with PV market share of 41.3%. Hyundai used to be undisputed 2nd player for long, **but currently at 14.6% market share** where Tata Motors is breathing at its shoulders with 14% market share.  
Operating margins are higher for Mahindra at 12.3% due to being an only SUV player.

**Points to consider**  


Entire Auto industry is standing at crossroads to move on towards renewable energy like EV, CNG, Hybrid- so lot of technological change related investments has to be made by all players in coming few years. It is not clear which technology will emerge as winner, so incumbents must invest in all of them.  
  
**Top 5 suppliers constitute 44% of materials and top 10 suppliers constitute 59% of materials.17% of parts are sourced from Korea.**

**Hyundai has to pay 3.5% of revenues as royalty cost to HMC for R&D and manufacturing technology transfer.**  
  
Related party transactions in expenses side is 32% and 9% on the sales side.  
  
**HMC holds 34.16% stake in Kia Corporation** which operates in the automobile industry in India through its subsidiary, Kia India Private Limited. HMC’s chairman is also the chairman of Kia. HMI also supplies engines to Kia for their vehicles. Given the potential product overlaps between HMI's offerings and those of Kia in India, there is no assurance that conflicts of interest won't happen in future.  
  
12% of sales come from Middle East/Europe , 7% of sales come from Latin America, 4% from Africa, **so dependence on Exports is there for 23% of revenues.**  
  
**Capacity utilization in 9M FY24 is 97% , so until Talegaon plant comes up ( H2 FY26), there is capacity constraints for Hyundai**.  
  
They depend on subsidiary Mobis India for spare parts supplies.",2024-07-13 18:30:06,57.0,13.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1e2h9si/hyundai_ipo_analysis/,IndianStreetBets

post,1hfgpr3,Highlights of PPFAS unit holders meet 2024,Intrepid_Self4652,"We had a productive meeting with the [PPFAS Mutual Fund](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ppfas-mutual-fund/) team, which included [Rajeev Thakkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeev-thakkar-715b3b1b1/), [Raunak Onkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raunakonkar/), [Neil Parikh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-parikh-465b98187/), [Raj Mehta, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-mehta-cfa-8b8630a1/), [Rukun Tarachandani, CFA, CQF](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rukun-tarachandani-cfa-cqf-19765518/) & [Mansi Kariya, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansi-kariya-cfa/). Here are the highlights:  
  
Ø Achieving financial goals > beating benchmarks  
Ø Investment success is driven by asset allocation and compounding duration over individual stock/scheme selection  
Ø Midcap starts at 80k cr market cap and small-cap at 25k crore - no concerns regarding PPFAS Flexi Cap AUM  
Ø 4.5 lakh crores are invested in thematic/sectoral funds  
Ø No update from RBI on overseas investments. This question is asked to new governor now  
Ø Optimistic on India, but cautious due to high valuations. 80% invested but maintain 20% cash  
Ø Promoters are selling stakes (e.g., Whirlpool, Hyundai, LG, Walmart in Flipkart), while QIP activity and PE exits increase. Retail investors focus on SIPs, while promoters find value in QIPs  
Ø Okay to lose 50% of clients through redemptions than losing 50% of clients’ money by doing foolish things on investment side  
Ø Exposure to AI through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. Solar exposure is via transmission companies  
Ø Conservative Hybrid Funds cap equity at 25%. DAAF has a minimum of 35% equity. CHF taxation is as per slab rates, while DAAF offers LTCG benefits beyond 2 years. CHF can invest in REITs/InvITs; DAAF cannot  
Ø Rising investments in small-cap, mid-cap, thematic funds, AIFs, PMS, and smallcases explain their resilience in current market relative to large companies  
Ø BSE was a miss. Thought NSE would be a dominant player, but BSE made a remarkable comeback. Participated through CDSL.  
Ø Maruti (PF stock) – Only a pure four-wheeler play (others have commercial vehicle, investments in other subsidiary) – tracking M&M, Tata motors too. Maruti have missed on SUV, EV front but its fine – as technologies are still evolving  
Ø Sold UTI AMC & Bajaj Auto due to valuations. Question on capital markets – due to new IND AS, earnings volatility has increased a lot. Capital market business is inherently volatile and IND AS have made them more. Run up in stocks has gone up – so trimmed/sold  
Ø ITC – Not as attractive as it was when we bought. Still reasonable valued now. On ITC Hotels – demerged and asset-light  
Ø Overall investment returns are driven by three factors: Dividend yield, Earnings growth, P/E multiple (going up/steady/down)  
Ø Liquidity – to be looked from 2-3 factors in conjunction. First – how much of your investment strategy depends upon the churn (buy and hold ours). Second – Client concentration (less than 2% for our #1 client)  
Ø In India, perception has built up mid/small cap co.s will do well than large caps. In USA, its reverse. Not always true.  
Ø HDFC Bank being a biggie does not mean it’s at a disadvantage  
Ø Smaller AUM of PPFAS Tax saver does not give advantage to PPFAS Flexi. We follow the same approach. Just – no foreign stocks & arbitrage allowed. Tax saver – min. 80% invested all time. Flexi – 65%.

Ø PPFAS DAAF maintains a fixed income duration of 3.25–3.5 years  
Ø On government regulation – you cannot avoid this is probably any sector (pvt or public)  
Ø Exited Accelya Kale due to concerns over its parent’s product roadmap  
Ø Missed Nvidia. Fundamental assumption was wrong in this case.  
Ø Succession plan – we have alignment of interests. Financially: ESOPs, investments in PPFAS units, on the same page on strategy, organization moving forward. Built a relationship that has passed professional things.  
Ø Exploring a new asset class (10L min.) under evolving guidelines  
Ø No plans for the AMC IPO for next couple of years  
Ø On ESG: Governance – we consider this even before ESG was a thing. E & S part – neutral. Business is not black & white.  
Ø Real estate is difficult for conviction-led investing, but proxies look attractive. Book – Inside Real Estate by Sushil Sayal. Surprised if we buy any RE developer in next 3-6 months.  
Ø We do track momentum, factor based (volatility of business etc.). Models are built to identify long term trends  
Ø Hiring a financial advisor is one of the best investments.  
Ø A mistake is not where a stock price went down, or its good thing if it went up. These are an outcome. Process > Outcome.

Ø Not considering investment in China

post,1i3duxy,Analysis 2025 - Let it consolidate,SierraBravoLima,"Enter comment in below format, so everybody can easily identify the company.  
""company-name - your comments""

I have started analyzing bunch of companies from Dec 2024 and categorized them. The list of stocks below are categorized as ""Let it consolidate"" meaning they high in valuations, so only when it consolidates or comes down, can be bought to have good returns. 

This time, i have kept my analysis very simple, as everyone is concerned on Warren's Reserves(CASH) which is above $200b at the moment. So i have looked at these companies Sales, Profits and Reserves. For analysis, i have used [screener.in](http://screener.in/) as [moneycontrol.com](http://moneycontrol.com/) had too many ads.

This simply means the sellers are not lurking. 
I am convinced on arguments that all huge ipo shares are trading below IPO price but also they were multiple times subscribed. So people who borrowed for high priced shares shares sold post listing.
Here only value investors are there. QIB will be big time buyers for share to go to atleast 2500 in six months time.

post,1ehhcli,DD | NIFTY unlikely to crash in the near term,jacked_to-the_tits,"Listen up folks! 🚀🔥

With NIFTY hitting an all-time high of 25,000 and marking a \~15% YTD gain there’s been a lot of chatter about a potential crash. However, here’s why a significant crash might not be on the horizon:

# 1. Strong Q2 & Q3 Earnings Ahead:

Predictions for Q2 and Q3 earnings from Indian companies are optimistic:

(a) **Telecom Sector:** Major players like Reliance JIO, Airtel, and Vodafone have increased their tariffs by 20%, which is likely to boost their earnings for the next 2-3 quarters.

(b) **Auto Sector:** Historically, auto companies experience a weak Q1, but Q2 and Q3 typically see stronger performance. Expect improved results from Tata Motors, Maruti, TVS Motors, and M&M.

(c) **IT Sector:** With the US Fed expected to cut rates from September, US companies will likely increase discretionary spending, benefiting Indian IT firms with higher demand for their services.

(d) **FMCG Sector:** The new coalition government is focusing on rural development, which should boost revenues for FMCG companies.

(e) **Infra and Capital Goods:** Infra and capital goods companies will get new projects (because that's how this govt markets itself - ""development"", ""viksit bharat"")

(f) **Banks:** After lagging for six months, banks should also see better results as the RBI follows the US Fed’s lead in cutting rates.

All these factors suggest that the upcoming Q2 and Q3 will likely see strong earnings reports. Infact this is what the management of most of these companies have reported in their earnings calls - earnings to be better in Q2 and Q3. This should support further growth in NIFTY.

# 2. Favorable Global Factors:

As central banks all around the world are cutting rates - it means money will become cheaper and cheaper money means more investments! This liquidity is expected to flow into Indian equities. Additionally, Indian bonds are set to increase their weight in global indices from 1% to 10% over the next ten months, potentially bringing in $10 billion in inflows. While this bond news might already be priced into NIFTY, the overall trend is positive. Moreover, regardless of whether Trump or Kamala wins, US - China trade relations will remain elevated (may elevate even more if Trump wins) and this would benefit Indian manufacturing and exports.

# 3. Technical Analysis:

From a technical standpoint, NIFTY PE ratio, though slightly high, is not nearly overvalued. On the other hand a higher PE ratio often indicates investor confidence in future earnings and hence their willingness to pay a premium. Once these earnings materialize, the PE ratio will likely normalize.

Lets also take a look at this chart which shows that NIFTY has broken out from the middle of a channel when it crossed the 24000 level and isn’t facing extreme resistance at the 25,000 level. The chart, which seems to be in play for almost four years since COVID, suggests that there is room for further upward movement if better earnings are reported in the upcoming quarters. Thus, a significant correction seems unlikely; rather, we might see some sideways consolidation between 24,000 and 25,200 until Q2 earnings.

https://preview.redd.it/c2yyz8b462gd1.png?width=1771&format=png&auto=webp&s=603888ab531bcc0174995d9c4c53e3ebc16757ee

While there may be some profit-taking and short-term volatility, the combination of strong upcoming earnings, favorable global conditions, and supportive technical indicators makes a major crash in the near term seem unlikely. Instead, we might experience consolidation before potentially seeing further gains.

What do you all think? Am I missing any factors or do you agree with this outlook?

post,1exx8vk,Landmark Cars,brownchinaboy,"**Condensed Industry and Company Overview**

**Passenger Vehicles Volume Outlook**

Landmark Cars is a major player in the luxury car dealership market in India, operating over 100 outlets across nine states. The Indian passenger vehicle (PV) industry, although still developing, has seen significant growth with nearly 4 million cars sold in FY24. This marks a recovery from a 20% decline during COVID-19 when sales dropped from 3.4 million in FY19 to 2.7 million in FY21. The industry rebounded with a 13% CAGR, indicating strong demand, particularly from first-time buyers.

India’s car penetration is currently low, at about 24 vehicles per 1,000 people, compared to over 120 in China and 250 in Brazil. However, the PV industry is expected to grow at a 10% CAGR over the next decade, potentially doubling car penetration to 45 per 1,000 people.

**Premiumization and Market Fragmentation**

Premiumization is driving growth in the Indian PV market, with a shift toward more expensive vehicles. Even during economic downturns, the demand for premium vehicles, particularly SUVs, has surged. Over the past decade, while overall vehicle sales grew at a modest 4% CAGR, SUV sales increased at a 14% CAGR, reflecting a clear trend toward higher-end vehicles.

The market has also seen fragmentation, with traditional players like Maruti Suzuki losing market share to premium-focused brands like Tata Motors, Mahindra, Kia, and MG Motors. Five years ago, the top four players controlled 82% of the market, but today they account for 79%, with premium brands steadily gaining ground.

**Luxury Cars Volume Outlook**

The luxury car segment in India is poised for rapid growth. Despite accounting for less than 1% of total PV sales in FY24, the potential for expansion is enormous. Comparatively, luxury cars make up 18% of the market in China and over 23% in the U.S. India's luxury car market, while small, is at an inflection point, with a 20% CAGR expected over the next decade. Although luxury currently lags behind global peers, increasing GDP per capita and changing consumer preferences indicate a promising future.

**Luxury Cars Competition**

The luxury car market is dominated by a few major players, with Mercedes and BMW controlling 81% of the market. Globally, luxury car markets are more consolidated, and brand loyalty plays a significant role. Mercedes, in particular, is expected to remain a key player in India, although it may face competition from new entrants.

**Luxury Car Dealerships**

Operating a luxury car dealership in India is more profitable than mass-market dealerships. Luxury car dealers enjoy higher returns, with gross margins significantly better in the aftermarket business, which includes services like insurance, financing, and spares. These services are less cyclical and offer higher returns on capital employed (ROCE), making them a crucial part of the business strategy.

Landmark, the largest Mercedes dealer in India, has a strong position in the market, often holding monopolistic control in specific regions. This concentration ensures stable margins and high customer retention, particularly in the aftermarket segment.

**Company Overview: Landmark Cars**

Landmark Cars is India’s largest luxury car dealership operator, representing nine brands across nine states. The company is a key player for many of these brands, including Mercedes, where it handles 16% of the brand’s volume sales in India and over 50% in its core states. Landmark’s strategy is to dominate regional markets, ensuring high new car margins and strong customer retention for aftersales services.

**Thesis: Mercedes-Driven Growth**

Investing in Landmark is essentially betting on the growth of luxury car sales in India, with a significant focus on Mercedes. Mercedes accounts for 35% of Landmark’s new car sales but contributes more to profitability due to the asset-light “retail of the future” (ROTF) model. Under this model, Mercedes retains ownership of the inventory and pays Landmark a fixed commission, resulting in higher gross margins and faster payback on new showrooms.

Landmark is expanding its network of Mercedes dealerships, especially in new regions where it will focus on servicing rather than sales. This expansion is expected to drive a 20% CAGR in Mercedes-related revenues over the next decade, with significant growth in aftermarket services.

**Challenges and Diversification**

Outside Mercedes, some of Landmark’s other OEM partnerships are struggling. Renault and Jeep have underperformed, leading to dealership closures. However, Landmark is optimistic about a turnaround for Honda and Volkswagen. Despite these challenges, Landmark’s diversified OEM portfolio and its ability to maintain stable margins even with underperforming brands mitigate some of the risks.

**Growth Opportunities**

Landmark is well-positioned to benefit from the introduction of new OEMs like Mahindra, Kia, MG Motor, and BYD, which are rapidly gaining market share. These partnerships, combined with the potential for 3P servicing growth, particularly for owners dissatisfied with unorganized servicing options, offer significant growth opportunities.

The insurance, financing, and used car sales segments, though currently small, are expected to grow rapidly, driven by increasing new car sales and industry trends toward organized used car markets.

**Management and Culture**

Landmark was founded by Sanjay Thakker, who remains the majority owner. The company operates with a decentralized structure, with each OEM having its own CEO and specific KPIs. The core management team, including Mr. Paras Somani (Mercedes business), Mr. Ravi Shankar (overall business), and Mr. Devang Dave (aftersales), has been instrumental in Landmark’s success. The decentralized approach has allowed Landmark to remain agile and focused on its key growth drivers.

**Risks**

The primary risks include reliance on OEMs, particularly Mercedes, for product cycles and growth. Dealer competition and industry growth are also potential challenges. However, Landmark’s strong relationships with OEMs and its diversified portfolio provide some protection against these risks.

**TLDR**

Stock down because of negative profits, but profits are only negative because of fixed costs from new stores. Sales growth and same store profits growth is strong.",2024-08-21 18:33:33,3.0,2.0,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1exx8vk/landmark_cars/,IndianStreetBets
